yesterday may 1 our country celebrated workers day this occasion presents an opportunity to consider the situation of the common man or woman in our country the role of the labor movement in our political economy and the undoubtedly weak state of the nigerian economy today congratulations to labor and the federal government of nigeria on the introduction of a new minimum wage while the new minimum wage of n30 000 will help tackle poverty we must do more 95 per cent of nigerians still live below 5 5 a day approximately n170 or n49 500 a month while 90 million nearly 50 per cent of our 200 million population leave below the extreme poverty line of 2 a day employers and labor should increase labor productivity together with broad based growth across different sectors of the economy this is what creates inclusive economic growth the emphasis should be on creating a skilled workforce and dramatically increasing available electricity in order to increase the productivity of labor which in turn can support higher wages i call on the labor movement in nigeria to support necessary and fundamental economic reforms in our country reforms that will ultimately improve the living standards and economic opportunities for nigerian workers labor should hold federal and state governments accountable for their performance on economic management based on rational factors how economic populism blocks possible reforms economic reforms in nigeria should be anchored on the following factors achieving the right balance between the role of the state and the private sector an understanding of what drives the wealth or poverty of nations the presence or absence of skilled human capital strong independent institutions property rights a culture of innovation that is the basis of wealth creation as opposed to reliance on natural resources capital and affordable access to it an understanding of the difference between gdp growth total value of goods and services produced annually human development real quality of life as expressed in life expectancy availability and quality of healthcare education potable drinking water etc and structural economic transformation the shift from dependence on subsistence agriculture or raw natural resources to an industrial economy that creates value added exports sadly none of these factors exist adequately in the nigerian economy today one of the most important reasons for the absence of these foundations is economic populism a false appeal to the hopes and fears of the common people set against the interests of the elite economic populism can be exaggerated where political expediency leads as it does in nigeria to a tendency to admire the problem while taking no real action to address it in a fundamental manner in nigeria this doctrine has led to the huge cost of governance astronomical salary costs including ghost workers for civil servants politicians and their aides this phenomenon results in massive recurrent expenditures currently 70 per cent of the federal budget that divert resources that should be invested in human development as well as massive corruption the temptation to populism is a universal one when the industrial revolution began sweeping across the western world three centuries ago a wave of populism resisted the phenomenon out of fear that machines with far greater efficiency and productive capacity would put men assured of manual labor jobs out of employment had the populist streak prevailed poverty would have been the lot of today s wealthy industrialized world fortunately for these societies their leaders could see the longer term benefits of industrialization and parted ways with the old ways petroleum subsidy versus oil industry reform for several decades now for example successive governments in nigeria have maintained a wasteful and corrupt petrol subsidy regime in the name of the poor but these subsidies have favored the rich far more than the poor who do not own petrol guzzling vehicles nigeria has spent an estimated 10 trillion naira over the past decade in petrol subsidies many petroleum importers have gotten wealthy on the basis of fraudulent invoices subsidies may be used to stimulate production and export of value added goods as the asian tigers did decades ago but when applied to consumption they are often a monument to corruption the federal government should therefore bite the bullet remove the petrol subsidy and completely deregulate the downstream petroleum industry it should move quickly and decisively towards the at least partial privatization of the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc no more dissipation of effort in dictating fuel prizes that are practically impossible to enforce nationwide the role of the government is an important one that role is to be a strategic enabler for market economies to create inclusive growth but government cannot successfully replace the markets as the allocator of the prices of goods it can intervene strategically and occasionally to moderate any observed excesses of market behavior nigeria s oil industry ought to be liberalized but not without strategic provisions for the interests of the populations and the environment of the oil producing states that is not because the state cannot run corporations conceptually speaking that is a position of classical neoliberalism it is only partially correct to the extent that deregulation and a level competitive playing field will help achieve price equilibriums and remove corrupt arbitrage and the worst kinds of crony capitalism more accurately the nigerian state should not run businesses because as a matter of factual contemporary experience it can t the track record is there from nigerian airways to nitel and the nigerian national shipping line but state owned or state invested companies have succeeded in some jurisdictions such as china france germany and japan alongside the more dominant private enterprises the main reason the nigerian state cannot run companies well is because we have fundamental problems of nationhood ethos and the organizing principle the federal government of nigeria must develop and articulate a comprehensive plan to move nigeria away from oil dependence over the next seven years the plan should have timelines including a short term three year plan to 2022 with concrete deliverables and accountabilities the plan should be inter sectorial demonstrating how a linked up combination of policy and private sector actions in areas such as trade industrial fiscal and infrastructure policy will deliver a diversified revenue base it should have specific targets for revenues from the non oil sectors the economic recovery and growth plan eprg in its present form does not rise to the level of such a plan saudi arabia a much wealthier oil dependent country has developed a four year national transformation plan to prepare it for a world beyond oil the plan s specific components are known the country has ended petrol subsidies and will build a new 2 trillion sovereign wealth fund that will be the largest in the world it will privatize aramco its national oil company and turn it into an industrial conglomerate making its shares part of the new sovereign fund the whole point of the plan is to make investments by the sovereign fund not crude oil the main revenue earner for the kingdom by 2020 there is little evidence of such an intellectually and programmatically well articulated economic diversification strategy in nigeria today we cannot grow on a diet of good intentions it is not too late for the federal government of nigeria to create a better economic future for us all how forex policy strangles the nigerian economy our foreign exchange policy is essentially subsidizing a massive import economy that prevents the structural transformation of our economy the equilibrium exchange rate price or value of the naira is determined mainly by purchasing power parity the strength or weakness of our productive and export economy the price of oil and the quantum of our fiscal savings the price of crude oil which gives us 90 per cent of our dollar revenues is subject to external factors beyond our control today s oil price of above 70 notwithstanding the oil price will drop again we do not have a hedging policy to manage this risk the exchange rate of our legal tender relative to others will naturally deteriorate when this happens especially if external reserves are spent to stabilize the naira we have no fiscal savings as a buffer having wiped out our excess crude account for populist reasons we should reposition by engineering our economy to benefit from this scenario since importation will become more expensive we ought to shift to a productive economy based on exports not of other raw commodities or crude minerals but of value added products the absence of such multi sectorial policy action is why past devaluations did not help our economy meanwhile we should encourage dollar inflows from investors to address forex supply scarcity without a flexible and transparent exchange rate this will not happen to extent that is necessary a few years ago the mere announcement effect of an intention to move to a flexible exchange rate by the central bank which ultimately did not happen saw our stock market rise by 1 billion in a couple of days nigeria is an important economy and many around the world are keen on doing business in and with it but not at all cost yet despite not having a strong manufacturing and export base we erroneously believe that an artificially strong currency is better for the purchasing power of the masses so we must maintain the naira s artificial strength in the face of all logic as a matter of the national interest in doing so we carry are in effect protecting the national interest of the vested interests that have access to and profit mightily from subsidized dollars leadership and the role of labor leadership is the antidote to populism rational evidence based economic policy is essential for economic transformation combined with other attributes such as vision decision making and others the ability to formulate and execute evidence based policy and to communicate effectively to citizens and stakeholder groups why certain reforms are necessary and cannot be delayed is a critical aspect of effective leadership it can make the difference between the progress and wealth of nations across generations on the one hand or stasis and retrogression as is the case in nigeria on the other the lessons from latin america which flirted with populist macroeconomics for several decades to ultimate failure are apt this is where the role of labor comes in labor can work with a competent government to sequence and manage difficult reforms that will yield fruit for workers citizens and the economy at large conclusion populism resilient in our governance culture since the 1970s has made us a poor country it is the reason nigeria failed to develop a strong savings habit the political culture operates with the mindset that all public income must be spent including even what we have not earned it is why nigeria is today heading back towards a debt crisis with an ultimately unsustainable debt burden it is why we did not set up a sovereign wealth fund in the heyday of the oil price and even when we did decades later the project still faced stiff resistance from several politicians it is why the federal government bailed out profligate states that carry on as if the only reason they exist is to pay the salaries of bloated bureaucracies some of the bailout funds reportedly went missing the workers must be paid in the name of populism corruption and other bad habits thrive and poverty reigns populism should no longer hold rational economic policy thinking hostage in nigeria our federal and state governments were elected to deliver progress for citizens not to continue recycling the status quo that from every evidence has failed to deliver prosperity beyond immediate policy actions the constitutional restructuring of nigeria back to true federalism by transforming our geopolitical zones into regions that will be the federating units and geo economic zones remains the long term path to prosperity for the millions of our country s poor recommendations the federal government of nigeria should develop and establish in consultation with labor unions a set of policies to mitigate the likely short term inflationary impact of the removal of petrol subsidies and permanently end such subsides as from the budget for 2020 deregulate the importation and sale of petrol in order to produce a market determined price of petrol and mitigate adverse inflationary effects in the medium term fgn should establish a moratorium on foreign borrowing alongside measures to improve taxation revenue fgn should commence a progressive reduction of recurrent expenditure by 10 per cent every budget year from 2020 the central bank of nigeria should abolish differential exchange rates and establish a uniform exchange rate for all transactions the cbn should abolish the ban on provision of foreign exchange for the importation of most or all of the 40 items denied forex prior to this action the federal ministries of finance and industries trade and investment should establish appropriate tariffs for the imports of luxury and non essential items while creating policy to give reasonable advantages for locally manufactured goods including enhanced export incentives in order to realign the nigerian economy towards competitive manufacturing for domestic and export markets fgn should submit an executive bill for the abolition of the land use act according to a study by pwc this legislation and policy action will liberate hundreds of billions of dollars of dead capital potential but suppressed financial values in land and property related transactions that could lift off the nigerian economy fgn should strengthen the policy environment to encourage mass production of innovation and a pipeline of the products of innovation into commercial markets as from 2020 turn the n500 billion budget for the social investment programs into a one time equity contribution to a public private venture capital fund of n1 trillion for innovation and small scale entrepreneurship aimed at helping the poor and unemployed escape poverty by creating wealth and inclusive economic growth the venture capital fund should be managed by the private sector which will bring in the other n500 billion in capital this reform will bring in equity capital into the lower strata of the nigerian economy complementing efforts by the cbn such as the establishment of national microfinance bank that will lend at single digit rates to improve affordable access to it will also contribute to bringing in the informal sector which contributes about 65 per cent of nigeria s gdp into the formal economy and thus expand the tax net it will also create millions of new jobs for unemployed or under employed youth

overview the us dollar is consolidating yesterday s post fed rally and this is giving it a slightly heavier tone today equities are mostly lower and europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is off about 0 5 in late morning turnover which if sustained would be the largest decline in three weeks the s p 500 posted a potential key reversal yesterday by setting new record highs and then closing below the previous session s low benchmark 10 year bond yields are mostly a couple basis points firmer though italian bonds are the exception a stronger than expected manufacturing pmi appeared to spur demand meanwhile press reports seem to be playing up the possibility that a brexit agreement between labour and the government and a us china trade deal may be struck in a week asia pacific chinese and japanese markets are closed and will remain so tomorrow china s markets reopen on after the weekend while japan s markets will be closed on monday heightened speculation that the reserve bank of new zealand may deliver a rate cut next week appeared to lift local shares 1 2 to lead the region the manufacturing pmi among developing asia were mixed of note south korea s reading rose to 50 2 from 48 8 while taiwan s eased to 48 2 from 49 0 indonesia reported a tick up in inflation 2 83 from 2 67 but the focus on the msci decision to drop pt bank danamon indonesia from its index which triggered a sell off that push the jakarta composite 1 2 note that japan s mitsubishi ufj has a majority stake in the bank on the other hand s p upgraded the philippines credit rating one notch to bbb the benchmark 10 year bond yield fell six basis points to 5 80 the currency edged higher and as did shares in recent days reports have suggested that the us has softened its position in trade talks with china on patents for biologics and on cyber espionage reports also indicated that if a deal is not wrapped up later this month president trump may lose his interest the reports give a sense that the trump administration wants a deal and soon china s vice premier will be in washington next week there is the hope that this is the last round before a date for a meeting between trump and xi is announced the media built up market expectations in the past for such an announcement but now the timeframe may be a bit more compelling today is the first session in six that the dollar has risen above the previous day s high against the japanese yen it has traded a little through jpy111 65 so far it has stopped shy of the 20 day moving average and the 50 retracement of the drop since the year s high was recorded jpy112 40 on march 25 both are found near jpy111 70 and above there another push on jpy112 00 is likely before that though the jpy111 50 level houses an 850 mln expiring option and may be sticky the australian dollar fell back to nearly 0 7000 in the greenback s post fed rally yesterday last week s low was set slightly below 0 6990 it would make a technically more compelling case of a resumption of the us dollar s uptrend if the aussie were sold through there without the break near term consolidation is likely the week s high was set just below resistance we identified near 0 7070 europe three of the four largest eurozone countries reported stronger than expected april manufacturing pmi german was the exception france s flash pmi of 49 6 was revised to 50 0 and this follows a 49 7 reading in march spain s pmi increased to 51 8 from 50 9 and italy s rose to 49 1 from 47 4 for the emu as a whole the pmi ticked up to 47 9 from the 47 8 flash report it was at 47 5 in march it is the first increase since last july which was the only time it increased in 2018 german disappointed the depressed flash estimate of 44 5 was revised to 44 4 it was at 44 1 in march adding to its woes march retail sales declined by 0 2 although this was not as large of a decline as feared 0 5 the downward revision in february figures 0 5 instead of 0 9 brings the year over year pace to 2 1 from a revised 4 4 the data can only increase the calls on germany to provide more fiscal stimulus most vocally by those who are larger debtors than germany financial stability reports and the commentariat class often underscore the risks of italian debt and or bank bad loans italy s condition is worrisome but it is chronic not acute and few are in denial a likely candidate for disruption is not that which is plain sight and everyone and their sister is looking at rather than the periphery we would argue emu s biggest immediate challenges are in the core there are three talking points about the uk first the boe meets and issues its quarterly inflation report which updates its forecasts in this digital age to say the boe is on hold adds little the market has gone out another decimal point it is reasonable to anticipate a hawkish hold perhaps we could add even another decimal point we might consider it to be a less dovish hold the extension of brexit allows economic forces to push back into considerations there is some risk that there is a dissent saunders which even though maybe only one underscores the slight tilt second reports are playing up the progress between the government and labour and there is some optimism that a deal could be reached by the end of next week if true and can pass parliament the uk could avoid participating in the eu elections at the end of the month however if it falls through it is not clear where the uk goes next but it would seem increasingly difficult to may to remain prime minister that is a nice segue for the third point today s local elections around 8000 local council seats are up and most are in conservative hands the question is how many will they lose and who will be the biggest beneficiary some estimates suggest the tories could lose 400 800 seats and the lib dems may be the biggest beneficiary rather than labour the euro reversed lower yesterday though mr powell did not sell a single one it closed below 1 12 after being as high as 1 1265 the candlestick pattern looks like a potential shooting star bearish but there has been no follow through selling though some participants may be waiting now for tomorrow s us jobs report expiring options may also impact the price action there is a 1 2 bln euro option at 1 12 and almost 1 5 bln euros in options struck between 1 1225 and 1 1235 there is an option for 1 5 bln euro at 1 12 that will be cut tomorrow too sterling poked through 1 31 yesterday for the first time in two weeks it is consolidating now but yesterday s reversal on the fed was not nearly as dramatic as the euro s note that the five day moving average is likely to cross above the 20 day average today or tomorrow for the first time in over a month this is a rule of thumb metric and proxy for some short term trend following systems america there are two important takeaways from the fomc s meeting first the fed s understanding of inflation is evolving previously powell said that low inflation is one of the major challenges of our time now powell says that the recent weakness in inflation may be transitory of course this is what the fed s march forecasts showed but putting it into words had an impact this more than anything else seems to explain the nearly 12 bp increase in the two year note yield and sparked the dollar s recovery as well considering the decline in inflation to be a short run phenomenon puts some teeth in the fed s claim that the current policy setting is appropriate and it can be patient this seems to be a firm push back against market expectations and white house calls for a rate cut second the fed announced a five basis point reduction in the interest rate on reserves excess and required reserves to 2 35 the effective average fed funds rate has crept through the interest on reserves which should be the cap it was five basis points above at the end of april recall in h2 18 the fed raised the fed funds target by 50 bp but hiked interest on reserves by 40 bp this was to ensure that the effective fed funds rate stays below the top of the corridor system range rather than a point target the fed assured investors and businesses that the cut in interest on reserves does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy is that true in the sense that it is not an easing in an op ed piece earlier this week former ny fed president dudley argued that the fed should consider jettisoning the fed funds target as the interest on reserves is the key separately it is ironic that the fed said the same thing about reducing its balance sheet that there was not monetary signal and yet so many pushed back against it we recognized that a cut in interest on reserves was a distinct possibility but we thought after trying this approach two other times with little success and not wanting to send conflicting messages to investors the fed was going to try something different we thought it was more likely to launch a new repo facility to inject reserves into the system just like it defends the lower end of the range with reverse repos we are skeptical then that the five basis point move will provide any more of a durable cap than the earlier two adjustments it might just buy time to work out the new repo facility which powell indicated remains under review the us dollar is little changed against the canadian dollar it is in tight ranges as yesterday s gains are consolidated the three drivers we emphasis in us cad exchange rate are short term interest rate differentials oil prices and a function for risk equities canada could not keep pace with the jump in us rates yesterday record us output and a larger than expected rise in us oil inventories is weighing on crude prices the s p 500 reversed lower after rising to new intrasession record highs the near term downtrend is found near cad1 3455 today yesterday s high was just above cad1 3460 a move above this area could lift the greenback s tone ahead of tomorrow jobs data the dollar could hardly resurface above mxn19 00 initial support is seen near mxn18 90 now mexico reports pmi today meanwhile although mexico has passed labor market reforms required by the new free trade agreement canada s parliament and possibly the us senate will not take up the deal unless the trump administration lifts the steel and aluminum tariffs

quarter on quarter the market remains challenging with intense competition in prices as well as channel related incentives and a regulatory and macro economic environment which remains characterized by inflationary pressures and import restrictions on certain goods in addition a complementary law to the finance law introduced on 15 july 2018 further increased the tax on recharge transfer between operators and distributors from 0 5 to 1 5 with financial impact in h1 2018 and q1 2019 against an overall context of economic slowdown and growing inflation market competition on both voice and data evident during 2018 continued putting strong pressure on prices and arpu djezzy kept its focus on both prepaid and post paid with a segmented approach aiming to drive up value while protecting and sequentially improving its customer base with competitive offers on data total revenue decreased by 1 3 year on year a significantly lower pace of decline compared to q4 2018 4 5 year on year

by 5 8 year on year djezzy s q1 2019 service revenue was dzd 22 7 billion a 1 0 year on year decline while data revenue growth was 26 2 year on year due to higher usage and an increase in data customers as a result of 3g and 4g lte network roll out this data revenue growth is still supported by the change towards a more aggressive data pricing strategy that has been in place since the beginning of 2018 the net customer additions trend which was still positive during q1 2019 led to customer growth of 1 3 quarter on quarter and 4 5 year on year the quarter on quarter growth was mainly driven by the continued positive uptake of new offers launched earlier in the year in june 2018 djezzy migrated to its new dbss platform resulting in a slight increase in technology opex this

this new taxation djezzy s ebitda was negatively impacted in q1 2019 by approximately dzd 197 million the impact on ebitda from taxation and the increase in technology and commercial costs was only

challenging and limits customer growth in the market for example the restriction on sale of subsequent sim card within 3 hours of purchase of the preceding sim using the same national identity card has impacted gross additions across the mobile industry in bangladesh since q2 2018 against this backdrop banglalink continued to focus on acquiring customers in q1 2019 with improved network availability and managed to deliver year on year revenue growth for the second quarter in a row alongside ebitda growth after seven consecutive declining quarters total revenue in q1 2019 grew by 4 5 year on year driven by an acceleration of service revenue which increased by 5 4 year on year to bdt 11 0 billion the increase represents a continuation of the positive trend seen in q4 2018 despite banglalink s 3g network coverage gap compared to competitors service revenue increased by 2 5 quarter on quarter in q1 2019 an improvement compared to last year when q1 2018 was flat versus q4 2017 the revenue increase was mainly driven by an acceleration of data revenue growth resulting from network improvements following spectrum acquisition in q1 2018 and enhanced network availability along with the continued expansion of banglalink s distribution footprint the customer base grew by 2 4 year on year and by 2 0 quarter on quarter supported by improved distribution and network availability notwithstanding the intense pricing pressure in the market arpu increased by 2 6 year on year driven by higher voice and data supported by the introduction of flat tariffs data revenue increased by 36

vancouver british columbia may 01 2019 globe newswire western forest products inc tsx wef western or the company reported adjusted ebitda of 18 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 results were impacted by challenging markets and difficult operating conditions which led to higher operating costs prolonged winter weather delayed typical spring lumber demand and led to operational downtime in both our mills and timberlands in response we leveraged our flexible operating platform scaling back commodity production to match market demand and delivered an improved specialty sales mix to partly mitigate a weaker pricing environment first quarter highlights completed the acquisition of the assets of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington completed the sale of 7 interest in the port alberni forest operation to the huu ay aht first nations substantially completed building and equipment upgrades at arlington accelerated wholesale lumber activity more than doubling purchase

steps in advancing our specialty focused strategy including the acquisition of columbia vista accelerated wholesale activity and advanced our mutually beneficial partnership with the huu ay aht first nations said don demens president and chief executive officer we are pleased with the progress we ve made integrating our columbia vista division and look forward to the contribution this operation will make to our business going forward the company generated revenue of 275 7 million in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 291 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 284 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company mitigated the impacts of a slow start to the spring building season by reducing the production and sales of lower value commodity products the improved mix resulted in a slightly higher average lumber price on february 1 2019 the company completed its acquisition of certain assets of columbia vista corporation and related entities located in vancouver washington for us 28 4 million and on march 29 2019 completed the sale of a 7 interest in the newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership to the huu ay aht first nations western also published its first sustainability report highlighting the company s governance environmental and social practices and performance during 2018 summary of first quarter 2019 results adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2019 was 18 1 million as compared to 43 0 million from the same period last year results were impacted by challenging markets and difficult operating conditions which led to higher operating costs shipments declined as we reduced operating hours to align production to market demand operating income prior to restructuring items and other income decreased to 5 7 million from 32 6 million in the same period last year during the first quarter we continued to successfully advance our strategy as we completed the acquisition of the columbia vista operation in vancouver washington and closed the sale of a 7 interest in our newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership to the huu ay aht first nations sales lumber revenue was 218 9 million which was 4 lower than the same period last year shipment volumes decreased 6 due to slowing us housing starts and as extended winter in north america delayed seasonal demand average lumber pricing benefited from the successful execution of our sales and marketing strategy and a weaker canadian dollar specialty lumber revenue was supported by higher production from our duke point sawmill which drove a 30 increase in niche product sales quarter over quarter sales volumes of western red cedar wrc declined 15 compared to last year as poor weather impacted market demand first quarter japan lumber shipments declined 14 the addition of columbia vista led to an increase in douglas fir product sales to japan which was more than offset by weakness in sales of hemlock and yellow cedar hemlock market share has been challenged by subsidized japanese domestic species we successfully mitigated commodity lumber price declines by increasing our direct sales to china by 56 compared to last year specialty lumber represented 52 of first quarter shipments unchanged from the same period last year but an increase from the 49 we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 first quarter log revenue was 41 2 million consistent with the first quarter of 2018 a stronger domestic saw log sales mix offset declining log pricing log shipments were flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 as increased pulp log sales volumes offset lower export and domestic shipments our export log volume in the period originated from a first nation timber purchase agreement managed by western british columbia bc coastal chip pricing declined 17 compared to the same period last year declining prices and lower production due to mill curtailments led to a 30 decrease in by products revenue by products revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included 2 6 million related to third party custom production at our ladysmith sawmill operations lumber production of 202 million board feet was 3 lower than the first quarter of 2018 we grew production at our duke point sawmill through increased hours and improved operating performance challenging commodity lumber markets led to reduced operations at our commodity focused sawmills our newly acquired columbia vista division contributed incremental production of 10 million board feet in the quarter first quarter bc coastal manufacturing costs were 20 higher than the same period last year due to challenging operating conditions included in higher operating costs was 1 7 million associated with temporary mill curtailments and higher natural gas costs due to a temporary supply disruption log production from our bc coastal operations was 922 000 cubic metres 10 lower than the same period last year decreased log production was primarily due to curtailed englewood operations our bc coastal log inventory was 5 lower at march 31 2019 as compared to the same time last year our bc coastal harvest costs increased by 12 from the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by a 31 increase in per unit stumpage costs and a mix of higher cost operations coastal stumpage inflation has resulted from bc provincial government stumpage equation updates the ongoing influence of coastal log exports and log markets that have been unresponsive to weaker lumber pricing as a result of the misalignment between the coastal stumpage system and lumber market pricing we resumed export log sales in the second quarter of 2019 bc coastal saw log purchases were 208 000 cubic metres a 22 decrease from the same quarter last year due to lower market log availability strong demand from export markets and pulp manufacturers and lower harvest levels due in part to rising stumpage rates have limited market log supply to domestic sawmills consistent with our strategy we increased direct lumber sales to china to mitigate weak north american lumber pricing increased direct sales volumes to china combined with the impact of a weaker canadian dollar cad on united states dollar usd denominated freight and fuel costs led to a 1 8 million increase in freight expense compared to the first quarter of 2018 first quarter adjusted ebitda and operating income included 9 2 million of countervailing duty cvd and anti dumping duty ad as compared to 9 7 million in the same quarter last year duty expense declined as a result of reduced shipment volume offset by higher values for us destined lumber shipments selling and administration expense first quarter selling and administration expense was 8 8 million in 2019 as compared to 8 6 million in the same period last year incremental expense arose from sales and marketing initiatives board recruitment and foundational system and process improvements in support of our growth strategy finance costs finance costs were 1 5 million compared to 0 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher average outstanding debt of 55 3 million in 2019 compared to none outstanding in 2018 the company had drawings of 84 0 million on the credit facility as at march 31 2019 as a result of adopting ifrs 16 leases on january 1 2019 we recognized 0 2 million of finance costs on lease payments in comparative periods leasing finance costs were recognized in operating income net income net income for the first quarter of 2019 was 1 9 million as compared to 21 7 million for the same period of 2018 operating margins and net income were reduced by lower production and shipment volumes and higher operating expenses columbia vista asset acquisition on february 1 2019 we completed the asset acquisition of columbia vista corporation and related entities operations in vancouver washington this acquisition is consistent with our strategy of pursuing margin focused business opportunities that complement our position in selected markets bringing western and columbia vista together provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan which will support our bc based hemlock programs the combination of columbia vista and western makes us more meaningful to our selected customers and creates a stronger company for all our employees sale of ownership interest in port alberni forest operations on march 29 2019 we completed the sale of a 7 interest in our newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership tfl 44 lp to the huu ay aht first nations for gross proceeds of 7 3 million tfl 44 lp s assets consist of tfl 44 and certain other associated assets and liabilities of our port alberni forest operation we will continue to source fibre from tfl 44 lp to support our bc manufacturing facilities as part of the agreement we may sell huu ay aht first nations an incremental interest in the limited partnership subject to further negotiation other expense and operating restructuring items other expense for the first quarter of 2019 includes 0 7 million of transaction costs associated with the columbia vista acquisition operating restructuring costs were 2 2 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to severance and related expenses attributable to ongoing business optimization initiatives the indefinite curtailment of our somass sawmill and retraining of employees affected by the closure of the englewood train our somass sawmill remains indefinitely curtailed as a result of a fibre supply deficit arising from years of tenure takebacks and government land use decisions and rising costs associated with the united states us softwood lumber dispute we are evaluating options to create a sustainable long term solution for the site and we are considering the input of government first nations and other stakeholders income taxes current income tax expense of 0 8 million was recognized in net income in the first quarter of 2019 total income tax expense decreased by 7 3 million from the first quarter of 2018 as a result of lower operating earnings as we used the majority of our remaining non capital loss carryforwards during the second quarter of 2018 cash taxes were payable for the tax year ended december 31 2018 in may 2018 the company received correspondence from the canada revenue agency cra regarding certain restructuring transactions occurring in 2004 and 2007 to 2011 and the general anti avoidance rule management believes the cra s position is without merit management is prepared to defend its position if a notice of reassessment is issued and as such the company has not recognized any income tax provision as at march 31 2019 relating to this matter recent developments bc government forest policies in 2018 the bc provincial government the province introduced a coastal revitalization initiative and further policy initiatives that will affect the bc forest sector on april 1 2019 the province announced the creation of fibre recovery zones which are intended to increase the supply of residual fibre from primary harvesting for secondary users on april 1 2019 the province announced bill 21 forest and range practices amendment act 2019 designed to increase opportunities for public input improve information sharing on forest planning strengthen the minister s ability to manage forest activity expand the definition of wildlife to help protect at risk species and improve and streamline range use planning on april 11 2019 the province announced bill 22 forest amendment act 2019 if passed the new legislation will require approval from the minister before disposal or transfer of a tenure agreement to a third party the act will enable the minister to refuse to approve a disposition or transfer if it is deemed not to be in the public interest or detrimental to competition in the buying or selling of timber or residuals or to place conditions on the approval the impact that these policy initiatives may have on our operations cannot be determined at this time appointment of new independent directors on march 1 2019 western announced the appointment of laura cillis and cheri phyfer to its board of directors the board in accordance with the company s planned board renewal process these appointments follow the february 12 2019 appointment of michael waites to chair of the board strategy and outlook western s long term business objective is to create superior value for shareholders by building a margin focused log and lumber business of scale to compete successfully in global softwood markets we believe this will be achieved by maximizing the sustainable utilization of our forest tenures operating safe efficient low cost manufacturing facilities and augmenting our sales of targeted high value specialty products for selected global customers with a lumber wholesale program we seek to manage our business with a focus on operating cash flow and maximizing value through the production and sales cycle we routinely evaluate our performance using the measure of return on capital employed sales marketing strategy update we are progressing with the execution of our sales and marketing strategy that focuses on the production and sale of targeted high margin products of scale to selected customers we supplement our key product offerings with purchased lumber to deliver the suite of products our customers require our columbia vista acquisition provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan in the first quarter of 2019 we accelerated wholesale purchases to 11 million board feet in anticipation of spring building season and sold 5 million board feet market outlook despite recent lumber pricing volatility and slow seasonal demand due to weather events our long term view of market fundamentals remains unchanged in north america rising lumber consumption will continue to be driven by increased new home construction a robust repair and renovation sector and growth in the use of mass timber building technologies we expect lumber demand in china to continue to grow due to a government commitment to housing and economic stimulus while in japan lumber consumption is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years in north america prolonged winter weather has delayed the onset of the spring building season resulting in a supply demand imbalance and commodity lumber pricing volatility as weather improves in north america we expect to see recovery in demand and pricing for commodity lumber we anticipate any pricing response will be moderated by higher than normal inventories and additional supply as idled commodity lumber capacity returns we will continue to monitor prices and make adjustments in our operating plans accordingly improved weather conditions will also create opportunities for our western red cedar products we anticipate prices to remain stable for wrc timbers and wide width products the narrow width wrc lumber market is expected to remain weak due to competition from low price imported lumber and an abundant supply of narrow width us domestic cedar lumber we will continue to focus on managing our product mix to mitigate the pricing impacts in japan we anticipate demand will be relatively stable ahead of the proposed increase in the japanese consumption tax we expect hemlock pricing to remain under pressure from subsidized japanese domestic product substitution while pricing for our douglas fir products may be slightly weaker we expect to grow both volumes and price realizations for our niche products as we continue to refine the product offerings from our duke point sawmill we intend to leverage the planer rebuild and auto grader installation to improve recovery and lower costs we expect domestic saw log prices to decline in response to weaker lumber markets price declines may be mitigated by low saw log supply as coastal log production may decline due to stumpage rates that have become disconnected from the lumber market strategic capital program update we continue to implement a strategic capital program that is designed to position western as the only company capable of sustainably consuming the complete profile of the coastal forest and competitively manufacturing a diverse product mix for global markets our strategic capital program is focused on the installation of technology that will deliver top quartile performance and improve our ability to manufacture targeted products that yield the best margin in addition to investments in our manufacturing assets we also allocate capital to strategic high return projects involving our information systems timberlands assets and forest inventories in the first quarter of 2019 we completed the acquisition of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington and invested 3 8 million to substantially complete arlington infrastructure and equipment upgrades commissioning has started and we expect to begin secondary processing at arlington early in the second quarter in bc we took delivery of the first ten forklifts as we begin implementation of our centralized fleet management program and progressed on a number of small high return capital projects focused on debottlenecking our manufacturing operations softwood lumber dispute and us market update western s results for the first quarter of 2019 include 9 2 million of export duty expense comprised of cvd and ad expense at march 31 2019 western had 71 4 million of cash on deposit with the us department of treasury in respect of these softwood lumber duties on april 9 2019 a world trade organization wto panel ruled on certain matters relating to the application of softwood lumber anti dumping duties concluding that the us violated international trade rules in the way it calculated anti dumping duties included in the ruling the wto panel has allowed the us to use zeroing in its calculation of ad which canada will appeal the practice of zeroing had previously been disallowed by the wto with regard to softwood lumber the final determination of ad is subject to additional appeals from both the us and canada the us application of duties continues a long standing pattern of us protectionist action against canadian lumber producers we disagree with the us trade determination and the inclusion of specialty lumber products particularly western red cedar and yellow cedar products in this commodity lumber focused dispute as duties paid are determined on the value of lumber exported and as our shipments to the us market are predominantly high value appearance grade lumber we are disproportionately impacted by these duties we have filed a chapter 19 north american free trade agreement nafta separate like product challenge on which a ruling is not expected until late 2019 us market sales represent less than 25 of western s total revenue in 2018 continued strong demand and a lack of supply has supported improvements in our specialty lumber product pricing partly offsetting the impact of duties our acquisition of a distribution and processing centre in arlington washington and the assets of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington are expected to partially mitigate the damaging effects of duties on our products destined for the us market while increasing us market sales we intend to leverage our flexible operating platform to continue to overcome any challenges that arise from this trade dispute forward looking statements and information this press release contains statements

information currently available to us and refer only as of the date hereof except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements reference is made in this press release to adjusted ebitda which is defined as operating income prior to operating restructuring items and other income plus amortization of property plant equipment and intangible assets impairment adjustments and changes in fair value of biological assets adjusted ebitda margin is ebitda presented as a proportion of revenue western uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as benchmark measurements of our own operating results and as benchmarks relative to our competitors we consider adjusted ebitda to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because amortization expense impairment adjustments and changes in the fair value of biological assets are non cash costs and vary widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities further the inclusion of operating restructuring items which are unpredictable in nature and timing may make comparisons of our operating results between periods more difficult we also believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance adjusted ebitda does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by international financial reporting standards ifrs and it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs furthermore adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under ifrs and should not be considered as alternatives to measure performance under ifrs moreover because all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in the same manner these measures as calculated by western may differ from similar measures as calculated by other companies a reconciliation between the company s net income as reported in accordance with ifrs and adjusted ebitda is included in the company s management s discussion analysis for the year ended december 31 2018 which is available under the company s profile on sedar at www sedar com also in this press release management uses key performance indicators such as net debt net debt to capitalization and current assets to current liabilities net debt is defined as long term debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt to capitalization is a ratio defined as net debt divided by capitalization with capitalization being the sum of net debt and equity current assets to current liabilities is defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities these key performance indicators are non gaap financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers they are not recognized by ifrs however they are meaningful in that they indicate the company s ability to meet their obligations on an ongoing basis and indicate whether the company is more or less leveraged than the prior year western is an integrated forest products company building a margin focused log and lumber business to

the inexorable rise of china as an economic superpower has invited disturbing bouts of insecurity on the part of the western alliance at various times over the course of the last three decades time and again the chinese state has been forced go the extra mile to defend its peaceful rise at one point even working that phrase into official policy aspersions cast by western officials anxious to maintain the post world war ii order in international affairs has seen china develop its win win concept in foreign policy all the better to set nations it dealt with at ease yet nothing that has gone before could match the sheer alarm that has been emanating from that most important of western capitals washington ever since a certain real estate billionaire turned reality television star moved into its most famous address at 1600 pennsylvania avenue otherwise known as the white house donald trump s conflict with the asian powerhouse began during his presidential campaign when he promised to stop what he described as china s longtime abuse of the broken international system and unfair practices steve bannon his former consigliere has compared china to 1930s germany warning the country could go down the same dark path if the us fails to challenge its rise to that extent trump s actions since taking over as president in 2017 will hardly have raised eyebrows the administration s national security strategy paper set the stage promising competition and resistance to chinese trade and other abuses after initially reaching out to chinese president xi jinping the second year of the trump presidency saw the us ratchet up a trade war that most likely neither can win against beijing with the imposition of tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods trump even threatened to target all chinese exports to the us beijing was forced to respond by imposing tariffs on 110 billion worth of us products the world s two major economies being at loggerheads almost throughout the year saw trade growth a key artery in the global economy slow markedly to around 4 percent in 2018 from 5 25 per cent in 2017 according to the oecd more recently we have witnessed the us set its sights on huawei a chinese telecoms equipment maker whose lead over the rest of the global industry in next generation 5g technology for wireless networks is said to be such that it is practically irreplaceable for many wireless carriers that want to be among the first to offer the new services yet last august the us president signed into law the national defense authorization act ndaa of which section 889 bars us federal agencies and their contractors from procuring huawei equipment and services it s precisely the sort of singling out of a multinational corporation or company that us would never countenance against one of its own in one of the latest episodes that demonstrated just how seriously the us or at least its present administration is taking the perceived china threat washington rushed to warn italy against signing on to what stands out as china s most ambitious economic effort to date on a global scale the belt and road initiative bri denouncing it as a vanity project in a thinly veiled rebuke of the initiative which aims to unite european and asian markets a spokesman for the white house s group of national security advisers said that italy s participation in the bri would add legitimacy to beijing s infrastructure project italy is a major global economy and great investment destination no need for italian government to lend legitimacy to china s infrastructure vanity project spokesman garrett marquis said on twitter bannon who happened to be in rome at the time in his new found role as some sort of global emissary for far right populist movements called on the italian government to rethink its position i beseech the people of italy to look at china s predatory economic model before signing any deals he told reporters the chinese have a rapacious appetite for global domination it didn t work defying the pressure from its us ally the italian government entered into a memorandum of understanding with its chinese counterpart signaling italy s participation in the bri in late march in total chinese investors accompanying their president signed twenty nine separate deals amounting to 2 8 billion worth of projects most notably they agreed to invest in port infrastructure in trieste genoa and palermo which could give chinese goods faster access to europe according to the council on foreign relations a respected us think tank italy s signature marks a turning point it is the first group of seven g7 a rich countries club nation and the largest eu member to accept bri funds and why not nothing to fear but one of the ways perhaps the principal way in which china s critics have sought to discourage other countries from joining the bri has been to depict beijing s outreach efforts to promote the initiative through its largesse as a form of debt trap diplomacy a more sinister ploy through which china intended to bend debtor countries to its will by burdening them with huge infrastructure loans these fears have been increasingly visited upon bangladesh as well since joining the initiative during xi jinping s visit to dhaka in october 2016 some of the key infrastructure projects of the country like the padma bridge and karnaphuli tunnel fall under under the bri the fearmongering around chinese debt became serious enough that the chinese embassy in dhaka was forced to address the issue head on recently ahead of the second belt and road forum a summit of sorts centred on the bri that was held in beijing this past week forcefully defending the initiative charge d affaires of the chinese embassy chen wei said the theories that posit the bri as a geopolitical tool of china or a possible debt trap for relevant countries are totally off the mark reveal prejudices and amount to nothing more than smears against the bri he pointed out that china is a late entrant to the international finance markets and its loans account for only a low percentage in the national debt of the relevant countries four fifths of development loans china gives out are below the market interest rate he said citing a report of the central bank of sri lanka he said the china related debt there accounts for merely 10 6 percent of its total within which 61 per cent is at an interest rate far below the international market he noted that not a single country has so far been trapped into a debt crisis for joining the bri referring to bangladesh he said china mostly encourages foreign direct investment fdi that creates jobs and contributes to the country s inclusive growth if you look at the government to government g2g arrangement we provide soft loans the interest rate is between 2 0 per cent and 3 0 per cent we don t even encourage this loan we promote investments for bangladesh he said under the bri a lot of qualified chinese companies come to bangladesh to help construct roads bridges power stations and water facilities currently there are over 200 chinese companies operating in bangladesh with chinese smes in even larger number bangladesh has become the biggest engineering procurement and construction epc market of china and non financial direct investment from china has increased by leaps and bounds he said prof li tao executive director of the institute of south asian studies at sichuan university in china recently told our sister newsagency unb that bangladesh holds an important geopolitical strategic position in the bri that offers great potential to strengthen economic and trade cooperation between bangladesh and china we should strengthen cooperation between the two governments and at the same time focus on strengthening inter party exchanges she said judging from the bangladesh government s enthusiasm around the 2nd brf the feeling might just be mutual and justifiably so ahead of the summit the prime minister s international affairs adviser dr gowher rizvi said bangladesh is proud to be a part of the bri bangladesh needs huge financial resources and technological support to upgrade the infrastructure make rapid industrialisation and create millions of jobs to eradicate poverty china can extend a helping hand in this regard said industries minister nurul majid mahmud humayun while addressing summit in beijing mahmud humayun who led the bangladesh delegation also sought to promote the bcim bangladesh china india myanmar economic corridor a project connecting china with south asia and the resourceful indian ocean that was listed in the set of projects under bri 2 years ago but went conspicuously missing this year possibly over india s continued snub of the initiative dhaka has recently also called upon beijing to speed up the process to sign loan agreements for several projects following up on the agreements reached during xi s october 2016 visit deals involving only five out of 27 projects that were floated at the time have actually been inked since the two countries signed the framework agreement during xi s visit the five projects that have got going involve financing of 4 5 billion against a total of 22 5 billion for the 27 projects not looking back while no proponent of shying away dr fahmida khatun executive director of the centre for policy dialogue a dhaka think tank does advise caution when it comes to taking on massive amounts of debt from china although bangladesh can attract huge amount of overseas investment through the belt and road initiative we also have to follow a cautious approach to ensure that our national interest is preserved in the long term she said the economist noted that there are some controversies regarding chinese investment coming through bri around the world international experience suggests that the lack of transparency is a big issue for chinese projects countries also often struggle to pay off chinese debts which also results in bitter consequences for the recipient countries she added her warnings would probably apply to taking on too much debt from any one nation be it china or otherwise despite all the speculation and cassandra like predictions no country till today has claimed that it is somehow being enmeshed by bri related financing from china nor did any bri project incur a systemic debt problem in its host country statistics revealed by philippine finance secretary carlos dominguez showed that at the end of 2022 the government s debt to china would only be 4 5 percent of its total less than half of that to japan which would account for 9 5 percent of the total the belt and road initiative has already reaped tangible results in the six years since its birth in 2013 as the 2nd brf amply demonstrated it has also accumulated worldwide support so far 126 countries and 29 international organizations have signed up to the initiative flourishing bri cooperation has over the years helped nurture faster trade and investment flows allowed for easier financial access and created more extensive people to people exchanges across asia europe africa and beyond two years ago when addressing the opening of the first belt and road forum for international cooperation brf chinese president xi jinping said we are ready to share practices of development with other countries but we have no intention to interfere in other countries internal affairs export our own social system and model of development or impose our own will on others in pursuing the belt and road initiative we will not resort to outdated geopolitical maneuvering as testimony to the bri s relevance and significance in today s world its vision has been included in documents of major international institutions and cooperation platforms including the united nations the group of 20 the asia pacific economic cooperation and the shanghai cooperation organization guided by the silk road spirit the initiative aims to promote cooperation in five major areas policy coordination infrastructure connectivity trade finance and people to people exchanges on financial cooperation china works with its bri partners and major global financial institutions to ensure a diversified and strong flow of funds for key bri related projects since its launch in 2016 the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib has become one of the key multilateral platforms for bri construction and has won growing global trust and recognition as of the end of 2018 the aiib had 93 members and had approved loans of 7 5 billion u s dollars on 35 projects in 13 countries including indonesia pakistan tajikistan azerbaijan oman turkey and egypt over the past six years total trade between china and other countries participating in the bri has exceeded 6 trillion dollars and china s investment in these countries has surpassed 80 billion dollars also the latest studies by the world bank and other international institutions show that bri cooperation will cut the costs of global trade by 1 1 to 2 2 percent and contribute at least 0 1 percent of global growth in 2019 also the bri is making a difference that ordinary people can feel a recent world bank report shows that bri related investments can help lift 8 7 million people from extreme poverty and 34 million from moderate poverty in a variety of countries

measured by the course of history over the last half century the arc of the economic universe has bent badly toward injustice it has been more than eighty years since the national labor relations act offered the first significant federal protections of industrial workers rights to organize and the social security act laid the basis for an attenuated welfare state new deal policies were hardly panaceas african americans immigrants and women never enjoyed their fruits on an equal basis with white men yet over time the struggles of unions and the civil rights and feminist movements widened the protections workers were able to win from the law and from organizing between world war ii and the mid 1970s as union density crested at 35 percent of the non agricultural workforce in the 1950s and then spread through the public sector in the 1960s the united states experienced a broadly shared prosperity the arc of the economic universe has bent badly toward injustice but over the last four decades we have witnessed the near total destruction of this promise of worker empowerment beginning with reagan the u s economy was reorganized wholesale having failed to build up political leverage to ensure that private economic power remained accountable to the common good workers saw private interests progressively shred the limited social bargain of the postwar years union membership has plummeted to 10 5 percent overall and only 6 4 percent in the private sector even more telling is the near disappearance of strikes in the 1970s there were on average about 289 annual work stoppages involving at least 1 000 workers as bargaining power shifted decisively to employers that average has plunged reaching only 13 per year over the last decade the result today is a staggeringly unjust global economy in which just eight men own as much wealth as half the world s population we now face a perverse concentration of wealth among the super rich pervasive financialization of the economy an upsurge of low wage and precarious work and the heightened power of monopolistic tech firms these transformations have relentlessly undercut worker bargaining power triggered an explosive rise in inequality and continue to undermine what remains of democratic governance and even as they tighten their grip the architects of inequality seek to control the alternatives we envision for our future in recent years they have promoted fevered future of work scenarios that imagine the disappearance of jobs before sweeping waves of automation and artificial intelligence hyping visions of the future of work that place capital s needs at the center the left is alive with creative energy not seen in many decades we must exploit it to make the future of workers not the future of work our central concern despite this grim turn of labor history in the united states there are many new reasons for hope interest in unions is surging and worker organizing is gaining ground in influential sectors including new media and higher education young people have begun to question some of the central assumptions of capitalism and have revived interest in democratic socialism the attention that activists have given to the intersectional nature of most struggles for justice has diminished the conflicts that once pitted advocates of a universalistic majoritarian left against those who feared that the voices of minorities and the excluded would be marginalized in such a movement the left is alive with creative energy not seen in many decades we must exploit it to make the future of workers not the future of work our central concern this new labor energy is partly reflected in the encouraging extent to which national politicians are acknowledging the need to rebuild worker power senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders have each offered bills that would empower workers warren s accountable capitalism act would require that all corporations designate 40 percent of seats on their boards of directors for representatives elected by employees and that those with more than 1 billion in annual revenue to obtain charters from the federal government sanders s workplace democracy act would ease union organizing and legalize secondary boycotts although legislative initiatives such as these are clearly necessary we believe they are also insufficient laws will not save us workers struggles and organizations must play a central role in shaping the twenty first century if we are to win the changes we need but workers will not be able to do that by clinging to strategies of the past the world that gave rise to the new deal and the great society in the united states and to social democracy in europe no longer exists the strategies that arose in response to twentieth century capitalism from traditional collective bargaining to co determination are therefore unlikely to be sufficient to the needs of the future this new labor energy is partly reflected in the encouraging extent to which national politicians are acknowledging the need to rebuild worker power the outlines of new labor thinking are visible in the recent efforts of unions and their allies to remake collective bargaining and organizing campaigns for the twenty first century these efforts have given rise to a conscious rethinking and broadeni ng of the participants processes and purposes of organizing and collective bargaining first while twentieth century collective bargaining was generally binary and involved only employers and unions recent efforts have attempted to broaden participation to give the community and other stakeholders a place at the bargaining table second while traditional collective bargaining was generally conducted behind closed doors by seasoned professionals who haggled over details recent efforts have infused the processes of bargaining with greater militancy opened it up to greater transparency and employed political action as a form of bargaining and third while traditional collective bargaining was focused on winning a serviceable contract that would signal a demobilization of the union s membership recent efforts have undertaken contract campaigns as steps in a long term strategy of worker empowerment they try to build enduring alignments between unions and their allies that accumulate lasting power through campaign victories a shared and increasingly fleshed out infrastructure and a common vision and narrative labor activists willingness to experiment can be traced to a conjuncture of developments triggered by the great recession president barack obama s agenda was derailed by the 2010 midterm elections which sidelined the union s hoped for labor law reform the employee free choice act propelled to power antiunion republican governors such as wisconsin s scott walker and tightened the grip of austerity politics on all levels of government union leaders increasingly recognized that they needed a bigger vision if they hoped to turn back the union assaults that gathered strength having secured obama s reelection they embarked on new initiatives laws will not save us workers will not be able to build a better future by clinging to strategies of the past in 2013 for instance president larry cohen of the communications workers of america helped launch the democracy initiative an alliance of labor civil rights and environmental groups to counter the corrosive influence of corporate money on politics fight voter suppression and address other obstacles to significant reform meanwhile afl cio president richard trumka moved to involve worker centers and other non union worker organizations in the planning for the 2013 afl cio convention the most significant catalysts for change were the emergence of new models of mobilization and organizing a turning point for these came in 2011 with the launching of three such models each of which in their own way signaled new departures in january the executive board of the service employees international union seiu approved an ambitious campaign called the fight for a fair economy which saw seiu commit tens of millions of dollars to organizing projects among low wage workers in multiple cities that effort would spawn local campaigns such as minnesotans for a fair economy mfe and ultimately lead to the fight for 15 a national movement to gain a living wage for fast food workers in july jobs with justice the national network of unions and community allies joined with the national domestic workers alliance to create the caring across generations campaign a national initiative to transform the long term care system and empower care workers over time it built an alliance that united over 200 organizations networking among care workers families whose loved ones need care and care recipients who wish to live at home with dignity and independence finally in september came the seemingly spontaneous eruption of the occupy wall street movement which seeded new and unexpected alliances among unions and their allies in many cities and spurred a discussion of inequality and the predatory nature of financialized capitalism that resonated well beyond the participants in its encampments recent years have seen a conscious rethinking and broadeni ng of the participants processes and purposes of organizing and collective bargaining a year later in september 2012 a precedent setting strike by the chicago teachers union ctu against the austerity regime of democratic mayor rahm emanuel attracted the attention of the entire labor movement and foreshadowed new approaches to bargaining led by karen lewis whose caucus of rank and file educators slate was elected to the ctu s top posts in 2010 the union prepared an innovative bargaining campaign in partnership with community groups and parents it called for smaller class sizes improved facilities and a host of other items that went beyond the confines of wages hours and other narrowly defined work issues about which the union was legally permitted to bargain the union also documented the schools financial mismanagement it showed how tax increment funding that could have helped schools was instead lavished on private entities such as the chicago mercantile exchange and it exposed risky interest rate swap deals in which chicago s school system ended up squandering more than 100 million by making the financial industry s exploitation of the school district an issue the ctu earned public support for its call for adequate school funding although the ctu did not win all of its demands its campaign inspired others to take on austerity politics in 2013 the st paul federation of teachers spft mounted a contract campaign that resembled the ctu s it patiently built an alliance with parents and community groups and with them jointly drew up twenty nine demands including one insisting that the school district cease doing business with banks that foreclose on their students families the union refused to back down when the school district refused to negotiate over many of them after rallying broad community support the st paul teachers won most of what they sought i had negotiated almost a dozen previous contracts for the spft explained the union s president mary cathryn ricker but for the first time i felt that signing a contract was just one step in building a larger movement meanwhile seiu local 503 which represents homecare childcare and university and state workers inaugurated a campaign called in it together that built alliances with the community by calling for a broad investigation into the ways in which banks were ripping off oregonians and demanding a state lawsuit against banks to recoup millions that were lost from retirement funds due to the secret manipulation of the london interbank offered rate libor a new strategy of bargaining and alliance building emerged from these campaigns in may 2014 many of the activists involved convened in washington where they gave that strategy a name bargaining for the common good bcg soon that style was spreading to new settings such as los angeles where the city s leading public sector unions and their community based allies launched the fix l a coalition in 2014 that coalition brought seiu the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme and other public sector unions together with community groups and faith based organizations they exposed the fact that more taxpayer money was spent paying fees to the wall street firms that marketed l a s municipal bonds and other financial services than on maintaining the city s streets furthermore they demanded that l a use its 106 billion worth of assets payments and debt issuance as leverage to demand better deals with wall street so that it can invest more in our communities at the outset bcg campaigns were meticulously planned in some cases the groundwork was carefully laid over a period of more than a year before they were launched yet the basic principles of that approach have proven to be adaptable in more spontaneous struggles as the teachers mobilizations of 2018 illustrated beginning in west virginia in january 2018 and spreading to such union averse states as oklahoma and arizona those mobilizations were in effect organizing bargaining and political campaigns all at once the workplace centered economism of new deal america is yielding to broader forms of organization social bargaining and democratic experiment teachers across the country gravitated toward a common good framework linking their struggles to the needs of their communities and targeted the most powerful economic forces in their states in west virginia teachers in all of the state s 55 school district walked off the job called attention to the fact that the state s wealthiest were paying scant taxes and refused to return to work until all state workers had received a pay increase equal to the one the state legislature granted them in oklahoma they protested the state s failure to fairly tax wealthy oil and gas interests in arizona they demanded that the state enact no further tax cuts until the state s per pupil spending on education reached the national average and briefly succeeded in getting an initiative on the 2018 ballot that would have taxed the wealthy to fund schools before the arizona supreme court had it removed on a technicality since the vast majority of strikers were not union members these walkouts were both massive organizing campaigns and democracy campaigns as well they posed explicit political demands such as raising taxes to fund public schools more adequately they instinctively adopted a bcg approach in that they were not just about wages or benefits but also about improving education and fighting for fairer taxation the teacher walkouts ensured that more workers walked out on strike in 2018 than any year since 1986 in january 2019 united teachers of los angeles extended that militancy the strike it launched was not only the eighth major u s teachers strike over a twelve month span but also the largest one yet and the one most explicitly employed a bcg approach with strong community support teachers stayed off the job for a week they settled for the same raise that the school district had offered at the outset and instead used their strike to win the hiring of a nurse in every school a reduction of class sizes the extension of a program that exempts schools from administering random searches of their students and a cap on the spread of charter schools innovative organizing and bargaining initiatives have not remained confined to the public sector by 2016 the communications workers of america cwa the committee for better banks and allied organizations laid the groundwork for organizing to improve pay and benefits for the nation s more than one million non union bank workers employing a common good approach similar to that pioneered by teachers unions this coalition positioned itself as a defender of consumers and an opponent of predatory financial practices it began demanding an end to the sales goals and metrics that force bank workers to sell predatory financial products as a condition of employment and more broadly to reform the finance system so that it serves the people instead of operating as a driver of inequality wells fargo workers connected to this campaign acted as the whistleblowers who exposed the bank s cheating scandals in 2016 bank workers at santander a spanish based multinational bank that is the leader in the u s subprime auto loan market have helped expose their employer s predatory practices these campaigns show how bank workers can help regulate their industry from below exposing and stopping banks from cheating consumers and engaging in practices that threaten the broader health of the economy innovative organizing and bargaining initiatives have not remained confined to the public sector two recent victories illustrate this tim sloan the ceo of wells fargo was forced to resign after congressional hearings where he was confronted by wells fargo workers who blew the whistle on wells fargo s reinstitution of toxic sales goals the was followed by bank of american increasing the minimum pay for bank workers to 20 00 an hour meeting one of the dmands of cwa and the committee for better banks the titans of private equity have also presented a promising target for labor activists particularly since such firms control a range of companies in multiple sectors and nations consider the blackstone group the world s largest private equity firm that controls 150 companies with a combined value of more than 400 billion and 600 000 workers blackstone is the largest owner of office space in the world the world s largest private owner of real estate the largest owner of logistics companies in europe and the world s largest investor in hedge funds activism around blackstone offers an example of how diverse campaigns targeting one such firm can be run at once tying together a variety of issues and organizations to challenge the full scope of the company s activities organizers are planning campaigns that would mount drives at the non union companies blackstone owns form a tenant union of blackstone renters and prevail on union pension funds to use their leverage to prevent blackstone from foreclosing on homes in post hurricane puerto rico at the same time union allies are preparing legislation in several states that would tax private equity executives to recover the states shares of the billions in tax revenue that are lost to the carried interest loophole that protects the hyper wealthy executives of private equity giants even amazon has not been impervious to pressure from workers and their allies perhaps the most difficult problem workers have faced in recent years is how to cope with the power of monopolistic corporations researchers have found that the rise of huge employers has led to the emergence of a monopsony in many labor markets where those employers set wages artificially low without fear of competition for workers no big employer has come to symbolize the problem more than amazon which pays its warehouse and delivery workers poverty wages even as it wrings tax incentives from the local communities where it builds its distribution centers creative challenges to amazon s power began to emerge by 2018 somali immigrants make up a huge slice of amazon s warehouse employees in the twin cities in 2018 many of those workers began organizing through the awood center an east african workers center to demand a voice in determining their workload regular consultations with community representatives prayer time on the job among other things in october 2018 amazon announced their minimum wage increase to 15 the company didn t have a set wage beforehand so the raises for workers ranged from a few dollars to nothing and as it raised the minimum wage the company also cut bonuses and stock options for existing warehouse workers the wage increase still does not address core issues leading to very high turnover including excessive hours and pace of work at the same time activists in many of the cities amazon induced into bidding for the siting of amazon s hq2 facility actively opposed tax giveaways and subsidies that their city leaders were offering to the nation s richest company contending that amazon s arrival would drive up housing costs and increase inequality they also objected to the undemocratic and secretive process through which cities courted amazon opposition was so great to amazon s announcement that it would cite one of its hq2 centers in long island city new york that the company felt compelled to reverse its decision in february 2019 these campaigns are in their earliest stages they are as yet insufficient in scale scope and resources to challenge and win against the richest and most powerful corporate monopolies in history winning real power for workers at powerful giants such as amazon and walmart is likely still years away nonetheless these campaigns are first steps that offer a taste and glimpse of the role workers and their organizations could play in redistributing wealth and power and moving us toward real democratic socialism taken together they show that even as union density trended downward in the decade after the great recession and even as unions absorbed blows like the supreme court s decision in janus v afscme last year new and promising labor initiatives have been proliferating the traditionally bifurcated approach pursued by the u s labor movement bargaining on one hand political action on the other is failing on every level most importantly these campaigns have begun the work of radically re imagining and redefining the goals and mission of unions they have either implicitly or explicitly broken with the traditionally bifurcated approach pursued by the u s labor movement for more than a century that approach held that workers should organize and bargain collectively to improve their wages benefits and working conditions and that they should pursue political and legislative action to win what they could not gain through collective bargaining it has become obvious that this approach is failing on every level having been largely blocked from winning significant gains either through organizing and bargaining or through the pursuit of pursuing electoral and legislative strategies workers and their organizations have increasingly turned to a more unified approach tying bargaining more closely to politics bargaining for the common good campaigns have shown that by consciously politicizing their organizing bargaining and strikes workers can start to feel and demonstrate the potential power of a movement that is committed to democracy at work in our communities states and country as a whole the teacher strikes have shown workers that they might win through job actions what they do not win through legislative or political action and the amazon hq2 campaign subverted the long standing assumption that secret taxpayer funded corporate subsidies were effective tools to promote economic development they suggest that the idea of collective bargaining that had emerged in the twentieth century is being redefined and repurposed in promising ways that challenge the erosion of democracy and the rise of inequality in the years to come we believe that the workplace centered economism that was characteristic of trade union based social democracies or new deal america will yield to broader forms of organization social bargaining and democratic experiment the inescapable fact that work relations in twenty first century capitalism are intimately connected to the structure of communities social institutions and lived environments points in that direction so do efforts to win justice for workers across lines of gender race and citizenship status winning bargaining power for workers and raising wages will inevitably be connected to efforts to defend public schools and mass transit create affordable housing repulse predatory finance and combat climate change these campaigns have begun the work of radically re imagining and redefining the goals and mission of organizing this is a vision with deep american roots recent efforts recall the vibrancy that characterized u s labor struggles in the era before the twentieth century institutionalization of unions and traditional collective bargaining from the lowell female labor reform association s resistance to wage slavery in the new england factory towns of the early nineteenth century to the community based assemblies of the knights of labor that took power in small towns like rochester new hampshire in the 1880s to the sewer socialism of milwaukee or schenectady in the progressive era unions of the past had concerned themselves not merely with wages and hours of their members but with a defense of the common good and the construction of a cooperative commonwealth labor s crisis is leading unions to rediscover elements of that american heritage and update it for the needs of this century it is now for us to take up that urgent work democracy cannot co exist with the overweening power of the likes of amazon walmart and blackstone any more than it could co exist with what lincoln era republicans called the slave power as louis d brandeis is said to have observed and as we have relearned painfully in our time we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can t have both
repeats may 1 story with no changes to text by eliana raszewski buenos aires may 1 reuters hobbled by recession and one of the world s highest inflation rates argentina may be lurching toward the next in a series of economic crises afflicting the country over the last 70 years consumer prices streaked more than 54 percent higher in the 12 months through march in defiance of central bank efforts to control inflation fueling poverty and further damaging a business climate blighted by nose bleed high borrowing rates the peso which lost 50 5 percent of its value against the u s dollar in 2018 has shed another 15 percent so far this year prompting the central bank on monday to ease limits on foreign exchange market interventions the situation is threatening president mauricio macri s chances of being re elected in october how can this be happening again in a country that was once richer than all its latin american neighbors combined is it macri s fault macri was elected in late 2015 as a champion of free markets promising to normalize the economy after eight years under president cristina fernandez a free spending populist who placed tight government controls on the markets he hired a cabinet of technocrats who promised to use orthodox policies to bring down inflation attract waves of foreign direct investment and put the country on track toward sustainable growth advertisement advertisement but some of the measures macri promised would cure the country s economic ills just gave it a different ailment to attract investment macri set out to cut the fiscal deficit first on his list of budget cuts the generous public utility subsidies that helped families recover from a 2001 02 sovereign debt default and shock currency devaluation that tossed millions of middle class argentines into poverty as useful as macri s budget cuts were on the fiscal side they had an unintended effect on people who had long taken the subsidies for granted every time a water electricity or home heating gas subsidy was reduced people s monthly utility bills rose the utility bills sapped the economy by reducing consumer spending in other areas and boosted inflation as businesses increased the price of goods and services to pay their own rising utility bills advertisement advertisement but macri started off so well after taking office in december 2015 macri got off to a good start he ditched fernandez s trademark currency controls and settled a long standing feud with holders of defaulted argentine bonds finally getting the country out of default in october 2017 his governing coalition swept congressional elections macri s political future looked bright story continues but argentina s high labor costs and activist unions known for going on strike continued to scare off investors the big foreign bricks and mortar investment promised by macri never arrived and the central bank appeared flat footed in dealing with the inflationary threat linked to the subsidy cuts when the united states raised interest rates last year money started flowing out of argentina and other riskier emerging markets all this pressured the peso prompting the central bank to increase interest rates which further weighed on the economy a noxious circle of fear low private investment recession and inflation deepened as the familiar doubts resurfaced about argentina s ability to pay its debts macri negotiated a 56 3 billion standby financing agreement with the international monetary fund the deal included a promise from the government to erase its primary fiscal deficit in 2019 to hit the target the macri administration cut more subsidies further inflaming inflation advertisement advertisement meanwhile the central bank s reference interest rate the one it gets for issuing short term notes shot to over 74 percent choking off what little credit there was for businesses and households cristina part ii some argentines have starting to look back fondly on the tenure of fernandez she remains popular among low income voters who benefited from generous welfare spending during her 2007 2015 administrations fernandez could pose a tough challenge to macri if she runs for another term in the october general election as much as the economy has suffered under macri many investors fear that leftist fernandez would be worse the catch is that when investors get nervous about political uncertainty they yank money out of argentina making it harder for macri to pursue his orthodox policies and get re elected advertisement advertisement the president has already been forced to embrace some populist policies including grains export taxes and price freezes on food staples two hallmarks of the fernandez years this has generated concern among investors who say these measures go against macri s own market friendly platform with the october vote up for grabs the only certainty in argentina is that uncertainty looks set to reign during the months ahead writing by hugh bronstein edited

spread the love as the international monetary fund and world bank held their spring meetings in washington dc last month economists with both institutions presented an africa growth picture which has worsened since the meetings in bali indonesia just six months ago the imf also downgraded its estimates of global growth which are now expected to fall compared with last year particularly during the first half of 2019 ac vol 59 no 21 struggling to keep pace the imf had in january already reduced its october 2018 projection for real gdp growth in sub saharan africa ssa in 2019 from 3 8 to 3 5 which remains unchanged ac vol 60 no 3 glitches in the growth yet the latest imf figures confirm that since bali it has reduced 2019 growth predictions for over 20 economies in ssa and north africa including algeria angola cameroon ethiopia kenya nigeria south africa tanzania tunisia zambia and zimbabwe the world bank slashed its projections of 2019 ssa growth from 3 3 in october and 3 4 in january to 2 8 now and unlike the imf now says overall ssa growth decelerated between 2017 and 2018 the bank like the imf and most economists believes that overall the ssa economy will expand more quickly this year than last like the imf the bank has since october reduced its growth projections for ssa s three largest economies south africa angola and nigeria they remain a drag on the region s growth and are predicted as a group to register negative per capita growth this year in 2020 and in 2021 slipping giants taking a historical perspective the bank now ranks these three among several slipping economies whose average economic performance from 2015 18 is clearly worse than during 1995 2008 it also lauds the performance of a number of improved and established ssa economies exclusively from east and west africa both exceeding 5 4 average growth from 2015 18 and improved compared with 1995 2008 the growth outlook for ssa and africa including north africa remains differentiated according to region the african development bank afdb ahead of its june scheduled annual meeting in malabo equatorial guinea maintains that east africa will as in 2018 outpace in declining order of growth north africa west africa central africa and southern africa this year and next yet the afdb s prediction for africa s fastest growing region at less than 6 falls short of the imf s predicted economic expansion in emerging and developing asia even if faster on average than the group of asean 5 economies indonesia malaysia philippines thailand vietnam convergence of average ssa living standards with more economically developed regions appears improbable for now differentiation also persists between non resource and resource intensive economies with the former set to outpace the latter in both the short and medium term imf economists predict that 21 mostly diversified non resource intensive ssa economies should reach or exceed 5 growth this year and that nine including côte d ivoire ethiopia ghana senegal and uganda could reach or exceed 6 among resource intensive economies the fund now predicts africa s oil exporters will during 2019 at least narrow the growth gap with other resource intensive countries commodity prices remain a key factor in these countries growth and for their government finances from an oil producer perspective the significant fall in oil prices from around us 80 barrel back in october has fortunately been followed by a modest price recovery this year backed for now by hopes of global demand growth and continued commitment by opec and some key non opec producers to cap supply the current outlook for non oil commodity prices remains mostly weak partly due to lower than hoped chinese demand on the fiscal front both washington dc institutions predict an overall reduction in median ssa fiscal deficits this year with most oil exporters though not nigeria achieving fiscal surplus current account deficits are expected to worsen this year on average reducing foreign exchange reserves in turn so too will price inflation particularly in africa s non resource intensive economies jobs deficit critics continue with some justification to bemoan the failure of africa s policymakers to achieve or set the stage for sufficient per capita growth to reduce inequality and significantly boost job creation imf economists repeat their assertion that 20 million new jobs need to be created annually to accommodate ssa s rapidly expanding labour force an unrealistic target should ssa s medium term growth plateau as the imf expects given the economic policy status quo at 3 75 in the medium term despite debt reductions in some oil exporters debt service and debt sustainability remains a concern in a number of economies sixteen ssa economies are still at high risk of debt distress or currently in debt distress according to the imf current imf hopes that average debt gdp levels will decline in oil exporter and non resource intensive countries depends on these countries following imf recommendations or at least matching baseline fund scenarios moreover both the fund and bank highlight the shift this decade in ssa countries debt away from concessional and paris club bilateral debt and the additional risks including currency rollover and increased complexity of future debt restructurings faced by several countries fund warning the fund along with other sceptics warns of the risk of reversal of the improved compared with much of 2018 financing environment currently reflected in the reduced borrowing spreads for frontier and emerging market borrowers that has encouraged ssa eurobond borrowings during the first quarter of 2019 including an oversubscribed us 3 billion ghana eurobond shortly before the country exited its imf extended credit facility programme another eurobond borrower nigeria still continues to spend the clear majority of its federal government revenues on interest payments the imf again warns that in the event of shocks including to interest rates revenues growth and exchange rates interest payments could significantly exceed 100 of these revenues nigeria s economic policies are unlikely to change significantly in the short term following the re election of president muhammadu buhari in february even with likely ministerial changes and the anticipated exit of central bank of nigeria governor godwin emefiele hopes persist that in south africa the continent s second largest economy economic reforms could accelerate following the scheduled may elections if as expected president cyril ramaphosa secures his first full term some market analysts are more sanguine on the risks attached to sovereign debt and associated rollover risk than the washington dc institutions ac vol 59 no 10 sounding the alarms on debt even so they still warn that zambia s debt woes could worsen significantly in the near term as its government struggles to present a coherent fiscal plan and if it fails to agree an imf deal to boost its finances see feature treasury in the red other analysts warn specifically of the growing level of bank financing to some governments and corporates on which there is often less transparency and understanding fast growing kenya is one country which has recently been negotiating with bank lenders over its expensive syndicated loans risks aside from potential debt struggles africa s economies remain vulnerable like the world economy to a number of risks the imf estimates for example that the combined impact of a deterioration in financing conditions commodity prices increased us trade policy related uncertainty and trade tensions and slower china growth could conceivably reduce ssa growth by 2 this year with commodity exporters the most affected other risks to african growth remain banking sector fragility the economic impact of insecurity and conflicts and adverse climate conditions as climate change protests attract international attention climate shocks have already impacted africa s economy this year including cyclone idai which has already zimbabwe s short term economic prospects and caused a

by farooque chowdhury may day is one of the most important days to the exploited people michael d yates director of monthly review press and former associate editor of monthly review magazine focuses on us labor and its movement in the following interview taken in april 2019 by farooque chowdhury professor michael yates whose academic fields are labor economics and the relationship between capital and labor also discusses labor s new initiatives at grass roots level defying and contesting official labor leadership farooque chowdhury you have been closely associated with labor in the united states for more than 30 years you have worked as a labor educator as negotiator representing unions as union organizer and as labor activist moreover you have covered labor widely in your articles and books based on these interactions and experiences please tell us about the present state of labor in the us michael yates if we look at some data we see that from a numerical standpoint the u s labor movement is weak union density the fraction of wage and salary workers who are in unions is low in january 2019 it was 10 5 percent in 1983 the rate was 20 1 percent and although the rates are not perfectly comparable for earlier years when the data collection was not the same at the time of the merger of the country s two largest labor federations the american federation of labor afl and the congress of industrial organization cio in 1955 the fraction of workers in unions was much higher probably in the neighborhood of 33 percent thus we see that there has been a long term decline in union density and this in a country that has historically had much lower percentages of union membership than almost every other rich capitalist country by comparison scandinavian nations have rates in excess of 60 percent with iceland over 90 percent even the absolute number of union members has been in decline over the past few years what is more the current union density hides the division between private sector and public sector workers in private employment a mere 6 4 percent of employees are unionized lower than it was more than 100 years ago while in the public sector the fraction is 33 9 percent however even in public employment rates have been falling and there is a widespread effort led by capital to make it difficult for public employees to unionize or maintain membership in existing unions public sector unions typically had contract clauses that compelled those who refused to join the union to still pay a dues equivalent to the union since they too would benefit from whatever the union won in the collective bargaining capital waged a long campaign through the courts to nullify such contract clauses employers achieved success when the supreme court of the united states ruled that compelling non members to pay dues was unconstitutional one last point with respect to public sector workers is that among the highest union densities is that for protective service employees these are police prison guards and the like persons who only by a stretch of the imagination should even be included in the working class given that their social role is to suppress workers these employees overwhelmingly serve capital unlike for example public school teachers transit workers and so forth another measure of the strength of the working class is the incidence of strikes there has been a marked decline in the number of strikes involving 1 000 workers or more these are called major work stoppages by the u s bureau of labor statistics which is the source of the data i have been citing in 2017 there were 7 of these involving 25 000 workers slightly higher than the all time low set in 2009 when there were a mere 5 such strikes with but 13 000 people out on strike the trend in major strikes has been markedly downward the last time there were more than 100 major strikes was in 1981 and the last year in which more than one million workers participated in major strikes was 1979 compare these numbers to earlier years between 1947 and 1979 there was only one year with fewer than 200 major strikes and years with at least 300 of these strikes were not that uncommon also between 1947 and 1979 32 years fewer than a million workers walked off the job in only 7 years the year 2018 did see a bit of an upsurge in major strikes due mainly to the aggressive actions of public school teachers in the states of west virginia kentucky arizona and california these strikes and a few others mainly by healthcare workers have shown that the strike tactic can still yield positive results as the strikers won significant wage and other increases the victories by teachers were the result of efforts by the rank and file to involve their communities and win their support for demanding better schools and education for the children of people in the communities what these actions give us is a bit more hope for the revival of a labor movement in the united states yet overall we are a long way from any sort of revival at the top of the internal hierarchies of most unions we have career bureaucrats interested mainly in their own advancement and security high salaries abound democracy is a rare commodity and statements of principles much less action on any set of principles rarer still unions are wedded to the democratic party which is at heart as much a party of capital as the utterly reactionary and proto fascist republican party unions cannot even come to strongly support the green new deal that the more liberal wing of the democratic party supports as part of an effort to come to grips with the destruction of mother nature now so well underway what is more the union chiefs are still supportive of u s imperialism i am afraid it will take more than rank and file protests to change things dramatically and in the direction of radical change what s the present condition of the u s labor movement my answer to question 1 provides my overall view i will add here that the u s working class like those everywhere in the world is suffering from rising insecurity in employment fueled by many things including outsourcing of work laws and court rulings and sophisticated mechanization stagnant wages diminishing benefits such as health care pensions and paid leaves seemingly endless speed up at work invasive monitoring surveillance and drug testing unhealthful and unsafe working conditions and rising temperatures that make working outside increasingly dangerous workers feel politically impotent and all too often the unions they do have ignored them or worse collaborated with employers and engaged in corrupt practices we see the unhappiness of workers reflected in several trends remarkably high percentages of young persons ages 22 37 tell pollsters they are more favorable toward socialism than capitalism and many even identify themselves as democratic socialists much of this is due to the success that senator bernie sanders who identifies himself as a democratic socialist had his run for the democratic party s nominee for president of the united states in 2016 this was followed by the election to the u s house of representatives in 2018 of several persons mainly women and ethnic minorities who also declared themselves democratic socialists in addition a political organization the democratic socialists of america dsa has grown very rapidly over the past two year and now has in excess of 50 000 members impressive in a country such as the united states dsa members have supported many working class efforts including strikes housing struggles and environmental efforts that would greatly benefit workers such as the green new deal it must be noted that what most mean by socialism is not what was envisioned by marx and engels and millions of radicals throughout the world ever since the two great communists wrote and worked rather it is the social democracy that has marked mainly the scandinavian countries that is a well developed state financed social welfare system buttressed by strong labor unions hopefully as social democracy is found to be no longer possible as it is faltering even in those nations where it has been strongest working people will come to see that more radical struggle is needed there are some groups in the u s that do have a radical perspective such as philly socialists philly is slang for the city of philadelphia and they are deeply embedded in working class communities hopefully these organizations will grow and flourish unfortunately there are workers who are too demoralized to do anything political or even to form labor unions depression anxiety drug and alcohol abuse and suicide are growing more common and among working class white workers life expectancies are falling anger and resentment also find an outlet in neo fascist politics as evident from the fact that some workers avidly support the criminal and thoroughly anti working class administration of president trump trump has used his racism sexism and xenophobia to fuel widespread hatred for the other whether the other be black americans women or immigrants this rightward trend is troubling and the labor movement such as it is must address this forcefully unfortunately top labor union leaders met with trump soon after he took office and by no means all labor officials are as hostile to trump as they should be which parts of the working class dominate the labor movement in the us and what s the reason in terms of power within the national labor federation the afl cio the most conservative unions mainly in the construction trades have power that belies their relatively small numbers these unions typically oppose anything that might threaten the jobs and high pay of their mainly white and male members such as the various oil pipeline schemes so detrimental to the environment they oppose any sort of green new deal as well several large industrial service and catchall many kinds of members from various sectors of the economy unions have influence based on their relatively large memberships these would include the teamsters union the service employees union the american federation of teachers and united autoworkers they might support more liberal policies and politicians but they are mired in bureaucracy hostile to the members interest full of careerists and often enough corrupt the real issue here is that there is no real labor movement to speak of plus overall membership is so low relative to the number of workers in the country that most laborers have no representation at all and even where there are specific working class movements such as the effort to win at least 15 per hour for fast food workers the leaders of such movements are all too often tied to the same bureaucratic and corrupt unions the only real hope it seems to me is for the mass of workers to forge new kinds of organizations see the question below on what unions should do for more details there are initiatives at the grassroots level in the us to go beyond or rise above the official establishment labor movement or labor leadership these seem to be sporadic and isolated most of these can t go that far but another part thrives what are the reasons behind all of this rise of new movement at grassroots level failures of a part of these and moving forward by the rest the rise of new organizations and movements is due to the overall suffering of the mass of workers and the inadequacy of the current labor movement these are indeed often isolated but some like workers centers operating inside communities and usually built by immigrant workers have succeeded examples are the chinese staff and workers association in new york city the new york taxi drivers alliance and the coalition of immokalee workers in florida the last is an organization of farm workers mainly immigrants in these examples we find dedicated leadership a model based upon active members and real democracy careful planning of strategy and tactics and strong community support built up over longer periods of time the same rules for success apply as well to worker managed cooperatives and urban farming ventures an example worth studying is the cooperation jackson movement in the city of jackson mississippi here is what i wrote about this organization in my book can the working class change the world the movement in jackson is called cooperation jackson cj and it grew out of various efforts by blacks to build a socialist community in the heart of u s capitalism the rallying cry of the people who began cooperation jackson one of the most notable of these was black radical chokwe lumumba who eventually became jackson s mayor something remarkable in its own right was free the land after doing some preliminary organizing in the area they acquired land and began to develop an ambitious plan of eco socialist production distribution and education in the south global warming is going to inundate low lying areas with water this fact and the disaster in new orleans after hurricane katrina made these leaders grasp that any scheme that doesn t take ecology seriously cannot hope to change the world therefore cj maintained from the beginning that whatever they did had to be based upon the principle of sustaining the environment the cj project has four goals gaining black working class control of the means of production in jackson and the area close to it building and advancing the development of the ecologically regenerative forces of production making the working class the agent of combining the means of production into socially useful outputs and democratically transforming jackson and then the state of mississippi and outward to the entire south cj has started cooperatives a cooperative school training center union and bank farms and grocery stores are an integral part of cooperative production there is much more to cj including the use of technologies like 3d printers to make useful goods the development of substantive political democracy and eco friendly public infrastructure the industrialization plan is particularly ambitious it can be criticized as not feasible but in any conceivable future goods will have to be made using one technology or another cj by beginning to conceptualize this and then implementing it will help show the way forward movements such as cooperation jackson may hold the key to the building of a radical labor movement in the united states one concerned with all aspects of working class life and willing to engage in militant collective self help activities what obstacles do these grassroots movements of labor in the us face there is the problem of funding it is best to have members fund activities whenever possible with solicitations from ordinary people supplementing the group s treasury reliance on existing labor unions or ngos is usually a mistake because such monies never come without strings attached there is also the problem of antagonism from capital and the state which will become worse the more successful the grassroots movement is there is the problem of developing grassroots experts for all the technical work and organizing that has to be done there is the problem of burnout from long hours and poor living conditions there is the problem of turnover in the membership as people move away out of economic necessity deportations in the case of undocumented workers and the like there is the problem of internal ideological differences which can split a group apart finally any grassroots efforts must show some results quickly so that workers benefit and they must find ways to protect members from capital s efforts to destroy what they are doing what should be done now in this perspective by labor at grassroots level and by writers of labor literature i have addressed this above when i wrote about what needs to be done to have a chance at success what writers can do is publicize all such efforts writing for those involved and not just about them also coalitions with other similar organizations are necessary and certainly education must be a primary component of any grassroots effort a membership that has learned its history the nature of the political economy the struggles needed and the obstacles that will be faced is more likely to succeed and more likely to have a radical perspective what impact has monopoly finance capital which has been identified and analyzed by john bellamy foster and fred magdoff made on labor in the us well monopoly finance capital has certainly increased the overall power of capital and this by definition will inevitably harm the working class specifically two things come to mind first as businesses are taken over by finance capital they are seen merely as collections of assets to be squeezed for maximum immediate return debt will be piled up and assets stripped for money when as much money has been extracted as possible the corpse left will be left to rot all of this will result in shrinking employment lower wages reduced or eliminated benefits and more unsafe working conditions finance capital works much like gangsters who do the same things when they use direct violence to take over a business second monopoly finance capital has meant the elimination of whatever autonomy the states of capitalist countries once had states are now adjuncts of finance capital and states are now run according to strict market principles the state s assets are stripped too the result being a diminution of both public employment and public services everyone is presumed to be on his or her own and no one will offer help the rich will continually get richer and workers will suffer more and more good reasons for the working class to finally develop a radical consciousness and get rid of this insidious system once and for all one more point bears consideration monopoly finance capital with its relentlessly short term horizon acts in such a way that financial bubbles become inevitable as witnessed by the housing bubble and crisis that struck the united states and then much of the world in 2007 these bubbles when they burst generate economic slowdowns which now have become deep recessions that wreak havoc on working class life has capital s capacity in the us to bribe workers eroded if it has eroded has monopoly finance capital played a role in the erosion if not then is the bribing going on as usual it is not so much that this capacity has eroded what has happened and see the previous question is that capital no longer has to bribe labor which in the past it did from the super profits extracted from workers in the global south profits abound for capital in the global north however labor is now so weak and disorganized and capital so strong that workers do not have to be bribed to support northern capital as they in effect were in the past some workers support capital without any monetary advantage and the rest are so habituated to the system that they do not know how to mount an attack on capital super profits have always helped to finance the states in the global north through taxation but now even the state offers labor no protection tax revenues can be and are used to buttress capital s profits and power this situation will continue to prevail until such time as there is a united global and radical labor movement to challenge it automation is creeping in unionization rates are falling what s the impact of automation on labor in the us automation robotization and other types of mechanization always lowers employment at least in the sectors most immediately affected and thus increases the reserve army of labor this reserve is now global in scope and mechanization occurs everywhere in the world this reserve puts downward pressure on wages and every other condition of employment and it generates some new and old types of employment that rely heavily on labor as in service employment and work done from home automation also divides the working class into a tiny elite of scientific workers and everyone else causing growing wage inequality which itself impedes labor solidarity often enough just the threat of automation like the threat of moving operations to other countries is enough to pressure workers into submission automation by allowing for greater surveillance of workers and building what was once employee knowledge into the machines themselves greatly enhances managerial control in the workplace at the same time however automation may make production more sensitive to disruption just as complex supply chains and logistics do but this requires that workers understand this are organized and willing to disrupt production the irony is that under a different socialist system more sophisticated technology developed for the people rather than against them could greatly ease the burden of many kinds of onerous employment and give rise to much shorter working hours and freedom for each of us to fully develop our capacities i might add that profits derive from the exploitation of living labor and not from machines themselves given this the idea of a fully automated society is science fiction machines would have to build and program machines and there would be in the end no living labor to exploit automation would automatically end capitalism this is an unlikely scenario are trade war s making any impact on labor trade is always a matter of politics and never just a matter of obvious and shared economic advantage thus given that almost all governments and certainly that of the united states are now servants of capital trade agreements will always benefit corporations and hurt workers such was the case with the north american free trade agreement which harmed workers in all three signatory nations the united states canada and mexico although no doubt mexican workers and peasants suffered most president trump has begun trade wars with many countries in part to satisfy his anti immigrant and xenophobic base these may upset markets and in that way damage workers in affected industries ironically they also might hurt the bottom line of those economic sectors impacted most by tariffs and quotas for example trade wars with china mean that soybean farmers in the central united states will lose lucrative export markets so far trump has always backed away from doing the damage he could do no doubt because of protests from powerful capitalists his base is largely ignorant of the nuts and bolts of this so he can always claim he acted tough with the foreign countries he claims are out to get the united states full scale trade wars can lead to real wars so there is always a danger of that and it is still true that corporations are headquartered and protected in the united states so there is competition among national capitals despite the fact that production is now so global so states will always be keen to protect their national capitals from a working class perspective the struggle should be for as much worker controlled and localized production as possible if for no other reason than that trade is very damaging to the environment and wreaks havoc on the poorest workers and peasants worldwide factional fights within the us ruling class are surfacing sometimes in ugly crude and dangerous form the fight at times is questioning the credibility of a number of very essential institutions of class rule the factions engaged in intra class conflict are questioning its news information views media the mainstream media or the imperialist media in whatever way these are identified its external adventures interventions and aggressions in other lands are facing debacles its credibility and that of its media are declining today its audience accepts little of whatever the msm report is there any impact of these on the labor in the us i wouldn t put too much emphasis on ruling class splits of course there are capitalists opposed to trump however in the end they will accept him because he has been good for their profits tax cuts for example which overwhelmingly benefit capital the most the situation may be different in other countries but here i don t see any segments of capital ready to revolt in addition as the democratic party has shifted significantly to the right the center of political gravity overall in the united states has also shifted dramatically to the right given that the republican party is to the extreme right trump is an evil maniac without a shred of morality or compassion and he is doing things most of us naively i think couldn t imagine happening and yet the mainstream media have profited mightily from trump s insanity with ratings going up every time they report on a new trump scandal the real danger is the rise of neo fascism with its inherent drive to annihilate the other it is possible to imagine that this will continue with or without trump the capitalist class is facing unprecedented crises foremost among them ecological catastrophe it faces constant wars too although capital has never vehemently opposed wars including the war on terror there will soon enough be hundreds of millions of climate and war refugees seeking shelter beset by unprecedented inequality which they don t mind for now given that they have gotten so much money as wealth and income move from the bottom to the top the rich will find it hard to hide what will they do demand more democracy and better media a more educated population i don t see this they will want the state to crack the whip and they will and are now build private fortified and heavily policed enclaves for themselves a society run on market principles must have violence at its beck and call this is really what fascism is all about only an aroused working class allied with peasants has any chance of stopping this the us ruling class is vigorously marketing divisive sectarian medieval politics what s the impact of this on labor in the us and what s to be done by the labor movement the working class in the united states is divided along many dimensions skill location education wage rates religion gender ethnicity country of origin and race among others among these gender ethnicity and race are most important the capitalist political economy here has been patriarchal and racist from its beginning the latter is the result of a vicious slavery that built the economy not just through the production of cotton but from the slave generated money that helped to fuel and in fact led the country s industrial revolution the unpaid labor of women in the home has been a gift to capital and women could be drawn into market based production when needed and discarded when not employers soon discovered that race and gender could be used to split workers fomenting competition rather than solidarity among them this has been done by the allocation of job with racial and ethnic minorities and women given the worst jobs and white men the best this along with constant racist and sexist propaganda soon gave rise to the notion that these groups deserved their fate i have written much about this and refer readers to can the working class change the world here however consider some of the results of racism a brief look at some data from the united states shows the remarkable disparities between black and white members of the working class median black family income is barely 60 percent that of whites a little more than ten percentage points higher than it was in 1949 black median household net worth is just 5 percent that of whites blacks earn less than whites at all levels of education astonishingly a 10 000 increase in the average annual wage of an occupation is associated with a seven percentage point decrease in the proportion of black men in that occupation besides earnings when we consider poverty unemployment health education housing life expectancy infant mortality or the criminal justice system we must conclude that having a black skin in and of itself is a grave economic and social disadvantage while having a white skin confers considerable advantage there have been forces within the u s labor movement that have actively combated the divisions in the working class sometimes with success usually these forces have been radical the communist party in the 1930s is a good example the left led labor unions purged from the cio during the anti communist hysteria of the late 1940s often did the same however much more needs to be done statements of principles of no toleration for racism and sexism by the afl cio and all individual unions are essential as is action to back these up collective bargaining agreements with strong no discrimination clauses and a willingness to strike picket and boycott over employer violations are necessary support for feminist and anti racist groups in the larger society is a must as is active participation in the protests and actions of black lives matter and similar groups promotion of caucuses of women black workers and ethnic groups as well as lgbtq workers could give these groups of oppressed workers a strong voice in every labor organization militant actions on the political front are badly needed general strikes to support immigrants oppose the rise of fascist groups and the like would show a real commitment to equality is there any impact of the present condition of and trends within the labor movement in the us on the labor movements in other countries historically u s organized labor has been all too often an adjunct of u s foreign policy opposing left wing unions and movements around the world therefore it has been rare for the u s labor movement to have a positive much less a radical impact on workers movements in other countries anti imperialism and opposition to u s led wars on poor countries has never been very strong in the u s labor movement this is still the case things may change as workers especially younger ones are drawn to social democracy however even in social democratic organizations a u s first view is common and a neglect of what is going on in the rest of the world is as well another positive development is the greater radicalism and willingness to organize and join unions of newly arrived immigrants into the united states hopefully these immigrants will along with black and other oppressed workers succeed in building a labor movement with an international working class perspective what are your suggestions proposals to labor as a whole and to the labor defying official leadership to deal with the reality that you have pictured in the answers above here is a long quote from my book can the working class change the world that i think answers this question labor unions have been a principal response by workers to capital s exploitation they are necessary defense agents and as long as capitalism exists they will form if unions mirror corporations in their structures which all too many do there isn t much hope that they will confront capital and this is all the more the case if they have entered into a compact with employers that views the two sides as cooperators interested primarily in the profitability of the owners businesses this strategy has failed the proof being in the deteriorating working conditions and life circumstances of union members and the sharp drop in union densities during the period in which partnership has marked much of the labor movement worldwide to begin to reverse course then labor unions must become democratic run by the membership and they must abandon labor management cooperation schemes since it is unlikely that current leaders will seek to do either of these things the only way forward is to get rid of the leadership in the united states a perusal of the magazine labor notes shows that there have been frequent attempts by rank and file activists to take control of their unions and put them on a democratic and militant path a few have been successful most have not no doubt the fear of such insurgencies has made some unions willing to mobilize members and take on the companies with strikes picketing and boycotts but reform has proved a daunting task similar to efforts by political advocates to move the democratic party to the left those in power seldom want to relinquish control and they will be as ruthless as necessary to beat back rivals still labor rebellions have been successful at all levels of unions corrupt criminal leadership was defeated in both the teamsters and the united mine workers for example and though the rank and file victors were subsequently defeated or weakened neither union is as awful as it once was in addition sometimes revolt has taken the form of a new union one that breaks away from the parent organization or if a group of workers have no representation and no existing union is willing to help them organize they might establish an independent union again in the united states an example of the former is the national union of healthcare workers nuhw tired of the service employees international union s seiu top down management its embrace of labor management cooperation and sweetheart deals with employers its frequent impositions of trusteeships the national union takes over the running of a local union on recalcitrant locals with rebellious and independent leaders and outright corruption the nuhw broke away from seiu in 2009 before asking what a democratic union looks like and what it should do it is proper to say that there are now unions that work in a democratic manner in the united states the best example is the united electrical workers an independent labor union that has the distinction of being kicked out of both the afl and the cio its national office and locals rest on the will of the members it does not make deals with employers and it has never been tainted with corruption officer salaries and expenses are strictly controlled and its constitution is a model of democratic principles that the union has adhered to through good times and bad other u s unions have served their members well too the overall trajectory however has been toward bureaucratic undemocratic structures and an increasingly unwarranted faith in labor capital compromise democracy means more than voting the structure of the union must be democratic there should be direct ballot casting by all the members for any office as opposed to convention delegates usually chosen by the leadership voting for those same leaders as is common in many u s unions term limits for officers are essential no advantage of any kind should be proffered to incumbents seeking reelection strict limits should be placed on the salaries of union officers and a careful open audit of expenses should be routine the rank and file should participate in all union activities from planning for negotiations setting demands strike preparation and the striking and picketing union meetings should be open to all members especially those with home responsibilities almost always women and also held at convenient times meeting discussions should be open and criticisms should be welcomed and debated special attention should be paid in all aspects of the union to the concerns and needs of racial and ethnic minorities as well as lgbt members retirees should be encouraged to take part in all union actions if a rank and file uprising is successful a breakaway union is founded or an independent union is created and even if these result in more democracy it is still necessary to ask democracy for what what are the principles and goals of the organization the nuhw lists these as its core beliefs a strong union is led by its members worker power is the foundation of a just society quality patient care requires that caregivers have a voice in their workplaces and are protected from retaliation healthcare is a human right this is a good preliminary set of principles but more needs to be said and done first education must be a priority compulsory classes should greet new members teaching them about the union s history and that of the labor movement as a whole and regular short courses summer schools and longer learning experiences should be made available with at least some courses required to maintain membership in these classes the construction of a broader array of principles and aspirations can be developed several come to mind an examination of racism and patriarchy the objectives here are ending discrimination in the union building greater solidarity compelling the employer to behave in a nondiscriminatory manner and leading the union to play a positive role in combating these divisions in the community and society a study of imperialism and militarism for unions in the global north the purpose of this would be to build an understanding of the role of their governments and employers in subjugating the peoples of the global south and of the past complicity of unions in this a radical labor movement cannot become a reality unless it is adamantly opposed to imperial wars arms production and sales the infiltration of the military into local economies and daily life the patriotism of flags and national anthems the mantra that we must all support the troops in the global north nationalism is a disease that impedes the global working class solidarity essential for human liberation unfortunately it is so deeply embedded in the institutional structure of capitalist society that the task of eliminating it is formidable yet if the effort isn t made there is no hope of the working class changing the world a serious discussion of the multiple environmental crises we face if these aren t working class issues what are global warming is a workplace issue ecology professor and writer andreas malm writes physical labour makes the body warm if it takes place under the sun or inside facilities without advanced air conditioning systems excessively high temperatures will make the sweat flow more profusely and the bodily powers sag until the worker suffers heat exhaustion or worse this will not be an ordeal for the average software developer or financial adviser but for people who pick vegetables build skyscrapers pave roads drive buses sew clothes in poorly ventilated factories or mend cars in slum workshops it already is and the bulk of exceptionally hot working days are now anthropogenic in nature with every little rise in average temperatures on earth thermal conditions in millions of workplaces around the world shift further primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions where the majority of the working population some four billion people live their days for every degree a greater chunk of output will be lost estimated to reach more than a third of total production after four degrees in this heat workers simply cannot keep up the same pace given the magnitude of impending disasters labor must make the environment a major concern this means opposing all corporate and public actions that exacerbate global warming the poisoning of air soil and water and the extinction of species among others when construction unions lobby for ruinous shale oil pipelines as happened in the united states other unions must speak out and condemn such self serving deeds as democratic unions strengthen and their principles and goals become more class conscious they will naturally ally themselves with like minded unions and community groups in this way a labor movement worthy of the name can begin and grow one concerned with the entirety of the working class including those in the reserve army of labor and the informal sector a union s most important immediate concern is with its members welfare here the question of democracy for what can take concrete form labor management cooperation should be immediately and permanently rejected replaced by an adversarial relationship that makes no concessions to management instead the union makes demands that challenge capital s control of the workplace higher wages are always on the table but so must be shorter hours more paid time off full parental leave for both parents for at least a few months a safe and nontoxic work environment active union participation in decisions related to both technology and work intensity an unrestricted right to strike over any issue a shortened grievance resolution procedure with rank and file participation at all levels the right not to cross picket lines while on employer related business and high monetary penalties for plant closures and relocations whatever makes laboring less alienated and weakens capital s control should be vigorously and relentlessly pursued unions should never allow the employer to play one plant off against another much less cooperate in this as the united auto workers has done strong protections for women and racial and ethnic minorities should be part of every contract when a union faces a multi plant employer or more than one employer it should organize coordinated communications and tactics among the officers on the shop floor office or store solidarity must be more than a word and an injury to any worker should anger every sister and brother what do you suggest to read study to learners like me interested to know about labor two of my books might be useful

after the cuban revolution hope that starting thursday they will be able to sue european and american companies doing business on their former properties that s thanks to the trump administration s decision to activate a provision of the u s embargo on cuba with the potential to affect foreign investment in cuba for years to come it allows americans and cubans who later become americans to sue

decreased by 8 2 or 23 3 kmt to 262 8 kmt compared to prior year adjusted for the plant consolidation in south korea volumes decreased by 4 0 versus prior year reflecting weaker demand in both segments largely due to a slowdown in demand in china and some rubber grades in europe weakened demand especially in the early part of the quarter resulted in significant destocking of customer inventories in china as well as other regions especially of higher valued grades volumes versus the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by 2 6 revenue decreased by 22 0 million or 5 4 to 384 7 million versus prior year primarily as a result of the volume decrease and foreign exchange translation effects which were partially offset by price increase particularly in the rubber segment and the pass through of higher feedstock costs revenue was essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter of 2018 contribution margin decreased by 13 9 million or 9 2 to 136 3 million reflecting the decrease in volumes foreign exchange rate translation effects negative feedstock differentials and mix significantly offset by base price increases mainly in rubber sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2018 contribution margin rose by 5 3 reflecting the increase in sequential volumes as well as increased prices particularly for rubber income from operations decreased by 10 6 million or 23 5 to 34 7 million essentially in line with contribution margin offset by lower fixed costs in part due to foreign exchange translation effects adjusted ebitda decreased by 11 4 million or 15 0 to 64 6 million

of a slump in market demand in large part in china during the first part of the quarter volumes were up by 5 3 however against the fourth quarter of 2018 particularly in europe revenues decreased by 10 1 million or 7 1 to 131 6 million in the first quarter of 2019 mainly due to lower volumes negative foreign exchange rate translation effects as well as negative mix impacts partially offset by base price increases revenue sequentially against the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by 3 7 gross profit decreased by 12 6 million or 23 3 to 41 4 million due to the lower sales volumes and foreign exchange rate translation effects and negative product mix partially offset by base price increases gross profit was up 5 8 against the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting the pick up in volumes and

quarter of 2018 revenue decreased by 11 9 million or 4 5 to 253 1 million primarily due to lower volumes and negative foreign exchange rate translation effects partially offset by the pass through of

extend its maturity to april 2024 consistent with the term loan b facility july 2024 the opportunity was taken at this time to also upsize the rcf from eur175 million to eur250 million while reducing interest rate costs by 60 bps on the back of strong subscription demand from participating banks 2019 outlook despite a challenging start to the year we saw some recovery towards the end of q1 in base volumes and premium grades as well as more confident customer sentiment mr painter said at the same time we have launched a profit improvement program and continue to work on pricing excellence a key initiative that we remain committed to executing we anticipate that business demand will improve from q1 levels over the course of the year as we have also started to see indications of improvement in china consistent with our previous expectations and further supported by recent positive trends we are reiterating our outlook for full year adjusted ebitda for 2019 to be in the range of 280 million to 300 million this outlook is based on the assumptions that oil prices exchange rates and feedstock impacts will not materially change from average levels seen the first quarter of 2019 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 95 million with our tax rate expectation for 2019 on pre tax income at 30 1 our basic share count at the end of 2019 is expected to be 60 million shares with no decision about any share buyback in 2019 in terms of other areas of guidance we are currently pacing our capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately 150 million comprising of base capex the already announced specialty line investment in ravenna italy as well as the us epa settlement related capex which is estimated to be around 80 million before any reimbursement to us by evonik for this expenditure as we actively evaluate our capital allocation strategy we are committed to remaining within our leverage targets and keeping our dividend stable as our strong and efficient financing structure supports these costs in conclusion mr painter said we believe destocking is largely behind us now we remain focused on executing in the current environment pacing our capital spend in line with business results cost leadership value pricing channel management operational excellence debottlenecking high margin products getting new products qualified and

financial measures in this release we refer to adjusted ebitda contribution margin and adjusted eps which are financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards us gaap or the accounting standards of any other jurisdiction and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we refer to these measures as non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is defined as operating result ebit before depreciation and amortization adjusted for acquisition related expenses restructuring expenses consulting fees related to group strategy share of profit or loss of joint venture and certain other items adjusted ebitda is used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and make decisions regarding allocation of capital because it excludes the effects of certain items that have less bearing on the performance of our underlying core business our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are a although adjusted ebitda excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and thus the cost of replacing assets or acquiring new assets which will affect our operating results over time is not reflected b adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest or certain other costs that we will continue to incur over time and will adversely affect our profit or loss which is the ultimate measure of our financial performance and c other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently because of these and other limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside our other us gaap based financial performance measures such as consolidated profit or loss for the period contribution margin is calculated by subtracting variable costs such as raw materials packaging utilities and distribution costs from our revenue we believe that contribution margin and contribution margin per metric ton are useful because we see these measures as indicating the portion of revenue that is not consumed by such variable costs and therefore contributes to the coverage of all other costs and profits adjusted eps is defined as profit or loss for the period adjusted for acquisition related expenses restructuring expenses consulting fees related to group strategy certain other items such as amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired from our predecessor and foreign currency revaluation impacts and assumed taxes divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding adjusted eps provides guidance with respect to our underlying business performance without regard to the effects of a foreign currency fluctuations b the amortization of intangible assets which other companies may record as goodwill having an indefinite lifetime and thus no amortization and c our start up and initial public offering costs other companies may use a similarly titled financial measure that is calculated differently from the way we calculate adjusted eps we define net working capital as the total of inventories and current trade receivables less trade payables net working capital is as well a non gaap financial measure and other companies may use a similarly titled financial measure that is calculated differently from the way we calculate net

through apps like turo and getaround don t pay the taxes and surcharges that local governments and airports tack onto traditional rental cars that s made them a target for rental car companies airport authorities and others who say the upstart apps should face the same taxes and fees that come with rental cars at stake is hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue that cities and airports count on to pay for stadiums and convention centres or to fund police fire and other general operations car sharing companies including turo and getaround function like airbnb for vehicles allowing people to rent out their cars when they re not using them founded about a decade ago they ve taken off recently with the help of millions of dollars from venture capital firms and other investors that s put

three dozen state legislatures as well as the courts and offices of local tax authorities us cuba lawsuits under trump change cuba business partners can now be sued miami ap people who lost properties after the cuban revolution hope that starting thursday they will be able to sue european and american companies doing business on their former properties that s thanks to the trump administration s decision to activate a provision of the u s embargo on cuba with the potential to affect foreign investment in cuba for years to come it allows americans and cubans who later become americans to sue almost any company trafficking in property confiscated by cuba known as title iii of the 1996 helms burton act the law contains exceptions for residential properties properties worth less than 50 000 and properties linked to travel to cuba deemed legal under u s law its activation thursday could nonetheless generate dozens even hundreds of lawsuits along with trade fights between the u s on one side and countries including spain france and britain on the other lawyers and potential plaintiffs say they expect only a trickle of lawsuits at first due to the expense and complexity of filing litigation under a law that is being put into effect for the first time and touches on issues of international trade and sovereignty suing is also expensive with initial filing fees of more than 6 500

interest rate unchanged wednesday and signalled that no rate hikes are likely in coming months amid signs of renewed economic health but unusually low inflation the fed left its benchmark rate which influences many consumer and business loans in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 the central bank s low rate policy has helped boost stock prices and supported a steadily growing economy whose outlook has brightened since late last year the fed did make a technical adjustment to reduce the interest it pays banks on reserves as a way to keep its benchmark rate inside its approved range the decision

formation forms of vehicle what legal form of vehicle is typically used for private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction does such a vehicle have a separate legal personality or existence under the law of your jurisdiction in either case what are the legal consequences for investors and the manager in the united states private equity funds are typically formed as limi ted partnerships in the state of delaware pursuant to the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act drulpa a limited partnership formed under the drulpa will have a separate legal personality the existence of which will continue until cancellation of the limited partnership s certificate of limited partnership a delaware limited partnership offers investors the benefits of limited liability as well as flow through tax treatment in the us the personal liability of a limited partner is generally limited to the amount of the capital contributed or that has been agreed to be contributed or returned by such investor the manager is the general partner of the fund with control over and subject to certain limitations general liability for the obligations of the partnership forming a private equity fund vehicle what is the process for forming a private equity fund vehicle in your jurisdiction a limited partnership requires at least one general partner and one limited partner neither of which needs to be a delaware entity to form a limited partnership the general partner must execute and file a brief certificate of limited partnership setting forth certain basic information about the partnership in delaware this filing is made with the secretary of state s office each delaware limited partnership must have and maintain and identify in its certificate of limited partnership a registered office and a registered agent for service of process on the limited partnership in delaware the certificate of limited partnership must also identify the name of the partnership and the name and address of the general partners although the names of the limited partners need not be disclosed in addition depending on the us jurisdictions in which the private equity fund conducts its business it may be required to obtain qualifications or authorisations as well as comply with certain publication requirements to do business in such jurisdictions there is generally no time delay associated with filing the certificate of limited partnership it can normally be prepared and filed on a same day basis the initial written limited partnership agreement to be entered into in connection with the formation of a limited partnership can be a simple form agreement which can be amended and restated with more detailed terms at a later date for a limited partnership formed in delaware the partnership agreement need not be and generally is not publicly filed the fee for filing a certificate of limited partnership in delaware is us 200 although an additional nominal fee may be charged for certified copies of the filing or for expedited processing there is an annual franchise tax of us 300 the fees for obtaining authorisation to do business in a particular jurisdiction are usually nominal but may be more costly in certain states there are no minimum capital requirements for a delaware limited partnership a private equity fund will typically engage counsel to draft the certificate of limited partnership and the related partnership agreement filings in delaware as well as in other jurisdictions where an authorisation to do business is required are typically handled by a professional service provider for a nominal fee which also provides the registered agent and registered office services referred to above requirements is a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction required to maintain locally a custodian or administrator a registered office books and records or a corporate secretary and how is that requirement typically satisfied a delaware limited partnership must have and maintain a registered office and a registered agent for service of process in the state of delaware this requirement is typically satisfied by the limited partnership engaging for a nominal fee a professional service provider to act in these capacities see question 2 although under the drulpa a limited partnership must maintain certain basic information and records concerning its business and its partners and in certain circumstances provide access thereto to its partners there is no requirement that such documents be kept within the state of delaware there is no requirement under delaware law to maintain a custodian or administrator although registered investment advisers under the us investment advisers act of 1940 as amended the advisers act must maintain an independent custodian of client assets in order to comply with the requirements of rule 206 4 2 the custody rule thereunder access to information what access to information about a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction is the public granted by law how is it accessed if applicable what are the consequences of failing to make such information available although the drulpa provides that limited partners are entitled if they have a proper purpose and subject to such reasonable standards as may be set forth in the partnership agreement or otherwise established by the general partner to receive a list of the names addresses and capital commitments of the other partners a copy of the partnership agreement and any amendments thereto and certain other information the limited partnership s partnership agreement may limit or expand this further the partnership agreement may and typically does provide that any such information provided to limited partners is confidential and is not to be disclosed by a limited partner to third parties therefore the public is not generally entitled to information other than the identity of general partners which is set forth in the certificate of limited partnership about delaware limited partnerships nevertheless as a result of the us freedom of information act foia certain similar state public records access laws and other similar laws certain limited partners who are subject to such laws may be required to disclose certain information in their possession relating to the partnership generally the information that has been released to date pursuant to foia and similar laws has typically been fund level information eg overall internal rates of return other aggregate performance information amounts of contributions and distributions etc but not portfolio company level information eg information relating to individual investments by the fund also limited partnership agreements and the list of limited partners have generally been protected from disclosure to the public a general partner s failure to comply with the reporting requirements of applicable law or the partnership agreement or both could result in a limited partner seeking injunctive or other equitable relief monetary damages or both limited liability for third party investors in what circumstances would the limited liability of third party investors in a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction not be respected as a matter of local law under delaware partnership law a limited partner is not liable for the obligations of a limited partnership unless such limited partner is also a general partner or in addition to the exercise of the rights and powers of a limited partner such limited partner participates in the control of the business of the partnership within the meaning of the drulpa it is generally possible to permit limited partners to participate in all aspects of the internal governance and decision making of the partnership without jeopardising the limited liability status of a limited partner as long as it is done in a prescribed manner even if the limited partner does participate in the control of the business within the meaning of the drulpa such limited partner is liable only to persons who transact business with the limited partnership reasonably believing based upon the limited partner s conduct that the limited partner is a general partner in addition under the drulpa a limited partner who receives a distribution made by a partnership and who knew at the time of such distribution that the liabilities of the partnership exceeded the fair value of the partnership s assets is liable to the partnership for the amount of such distribution for a period of three years from the date of such distribution and partnership agreements of private equity funds commonly impose additional obligations to return distributions there may be additional potential liabilities pursuant to applicable fraudulent conveyance laws in any case limited partners are liable for their capital contributions and any other payment obligations set forth in the limited partnership agreement or related agreement such as a subscription agreement to which they are a party fund manager s fiduciary duties what are the fiduciary duties owed to a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction and its third party investors by that fund s manager or other similar control party or fiduciary under the laws of your jurisdiction and to what extent can those fiduciary duties be modified by agreement of the parties a general partner of a limited partnership generally will owe fiduciary duties to the partnership and its partners under delaware law which include the duties of candour care and loyalty however under delaware law to the extent that at law or equity a partner or other person has duties including fiduciary duties to a limited partnership or to another partner or to another person that is a party to or is otherwise bound by a partnership agreement the partner s or other person s duties may be expanded or restricted or eliminated by the provisions in the partnership agreement provided that the partnership agreement may not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing under delaware law a partnership agreement may provide for the limitation or elimination of any and all liabilities for breach of contract and breach of duties including fiduciary duties of a partner or other person to a limited partnership or to another partner or to another person that is a party to or is otherwise bound by a partnership agreement provided that a partnership agreement may not limit or eliminate liability for any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing in addition practitioners should note that contractual standards of duty or conduct set forth in the partnership agreement will replace common law fiduciary duties with respect to delaware limited partnerships whether such standards are higher or lower therefore precise crafting of the language in a partnership agreement with respect to fiduciary duties relating to a delaware limited partnership is important in addition investment advisers whether or not registered owe fiduciary duties to their clients such fiduciary duties are not specifically set forth in the advisers act or established by rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec but are imposed on investment advisers by operation of law because of the nature of the relationship between the investment advisers and their clients such fiduciary duties are embodied in the anti fraud provisions of section 206 of the advisers act gross negligence does your jurisdiction recognise a gross negligence as opposed to ordinary negligence standard of liability applicable to the management of a private equity fund delaware does recognise a gross negligence standard of liability to the extent such standard is provided for in the applicable partnership agreement as a matter of market practice the exculpation and indemnification provisions in a private equity fund s limited partnership agreement typically carve out acts or omissions that constitute gross negligence but under delaware law a partnership agreement could expressly exculpate or indemnify for such acts or omissions other special issues or requirements are there any other special issues or requirements particular to private equity fund vehicles formed in your jurisdiction is conversion or redomiciling to vehicles in your jurisdiction permitted if so in converting or redomiciling limited partnerships formed in other jurisdictions into limited partnerships in your jurisdiction what are the most material terms that typically must be modified restrictions on transfers and withdrawals restrictions on operations generally provisions regarding fiscal transparency and special investor governance rights on matters such as removal of the general partner or early dissolution of the private equity fund are all matters typically addressed in the provisions of the partnership agreement and will vary from fund to fund typically the partnership agreement will require the consent of the general partner to effect a transfer of a partnership interest in a limited partnership this requirement enables the general partner to maintain the fund s compliance with applicable legal tax and regulatory requirements and exemptions as well as evaluate the appropriateness as a commercial matter of the proposed transferee although there is generally no right for a limited partner to withdraw from a delaware limited partnership under the drulpa the limited partnership agreement for a private equity fund may provide for certain withdrawal rights for limited partners typically only in limited circumstances for legal and regulatory reasons limited partners have the right to petition the delaware court of chancery for withdrawal or similar equitable relief in egregious circumstances eg fraud however obtaining such relief can be difficult in converting or redomiciling a limited partnership formed in a non us jurisdiction into a limited partnership in a us jurisdiction eg delaware particular attention should be given to requirements of the certificate of limited partnership domestication and certificate of limited partnership that may be required to be filed as well as any other requirements of the applicable state s laws relating to maintaining a limited partnership in such jurisdiction see question 2 in addition depending on where the redomiciled fund conducts its business it may be required to obtain qualifications or authorisations to do business in certain jurisdictions any provisions of the partnership law of the state into which such domestication is effected that are otherwise inconsistent with the pre existing governing agreement of such partnership should be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure conformity with the applicable law consideration should also be given to the tax consequences of converting or redomiciling a limited partnership certain aspects of us securities laws apply differently with respect to us and non us private equity funds for example in determining whether a private equity fund formed in the us will qualify for exemption from registration under the investment company act of 1940 as amended the investment company act all investors both us and non us are analysed for determining the fund s compliance with the criteria for exemption by contrast in the case of a private equity fund formed in a jurisdiction outside the us the staff at the sec has taken the position that only us investors must be analysed for the purposes of making that same determination assuming certain other requirements are met section 12 g of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act generally requires that any issuer having 2 000 or more holders of record or 500 or more holders who are not accredited investors as defined by the sec of any class of equity security and assets in excess of us 10 million register the security under the exchange act and comply with the periodic reporting and other requirements of the exchange act this section has the practical effect of imposing a limit of 1 999 investors in any single us domiciled private equity fund in addition rule 12g3 2 a under the exchange act provides an exemption from the registration requirement described above for a non us domiciled private equity fund that qualifies as a foreign private issuer and has fewer than 300 holders of equity securities resident in the us rule 3b 4 c under the exchange act provides that a private equity fund that is organised outside of the us generally qualifies as a foreign private issuer unless more than 50 per cent of its outstanding voting securities are held by us residents and any of the following applies a majority of its executive officers and directors are us citizens or residents more than 50 per cent of its assets are located in the us or its business is administered principally in the us for purposes of generally accepted us accounting principles to avoid consolidation of the financial statements of a private equity fund with its general partner which is an issue of particular concern for some publicly listed private equity fund sponsors the fund must provide its unaffiliated limited partners with the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the fund and appoint a third party as liquidator or otherwise remove the general partner without cause on a simple majority basis often referred to as kick out rights fund sponsor bankruptcy or change of control with respect to institutional sponsors of private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction what are some of the primary legal and regulatory consequences and other key issues for the private equity fund and its general partner and investment adviser arising out of a bankruptcy insolvency change of control restructuring or similar transaction of the private equity fund s sponsor depending on the structure of a private equity fund and its general partner and the specific provisions of their operating agreements the bankruptcy or insolvency of the ultimate sponsor of a private equity fund could result in the bankruptcy or dissolution of the private equity fund s general partner or investment adviser or of the fund itself moreover such a bankruptcy or insolvency event could result in the inability of the sponsor to meet its funding obligations with respect to its capital commitment to the private equity fund depending on the terms of the private equity fund s partnership agreement such a default could constitute a cause event and thereby trigger rights of the limited partners to remove the private equity fund s general partner dissolve the private equity fund itself or cause the forfeiture of all or a portion of the general partner s unrealised carried interest or all of these in addition to such cause protections a sponsor bankruptcy may result in a private equity fund s limited partners seeking to exercise the no fault remedies included in many partnership agreements which often permit termination of the investment period removal of the private equity fund s general partner or dissolution of the private equity fund with respect to us bankruptcy law a sponsor that has filed for reorganisation under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code should still be permitted to operate non bankrupt subsidiaries including for example related private equity funds and their general partners as ongoing businesses although this raises a variety of operational issues including for example whether ordinary course investment and private equity fund management decisions must be approved by the bankruptcy court a change of control or similar transaction with respect to an institutional sponsor may also give rise to statutory and contractual rights and obligations including one or both of the following a requirement under the advisers act for registered investment advisers and those required to be registered to obtain effective client consent namely consent of the private equity fund s limited partners or a committee thereof to transactions involving an assignment of the sponsor s investment advisory contract which a change of control generally triggers and the ability of the private equity fund s limited partners to cancel the commitment period dissolve the fund remove the general partner or sue the general partner for a breach of a negative covenant against transfers of interests in the general partner under the terms of the private equity fund s partnership agreement regulation licensing and registration principal regulatory bodies what are the principal regulatory bodies that would have authority over a private equity fund and its manager in your jurisdiction and what are the regulators audit and inspection rights and managers regulatory reporting requirements to investors or regulators advisers act registration requirements and exemptions the sec has the authority to regulate investment advisers pursuant to the advisers act investment advisers may also be subject to regulatory requirements at the state level under the advisers act all investment advisers to private equity funds are generally required to be registered with the sec under the advisers act unless they meet one of the following limited exemptions from such registration the venture capital fund adviser exemption investment advisers solely to venture capital funds private funds that represent themselves to their investors and prospective investors as pursuing a venture capital strategy and that comply with other significant requirements including limitations of the amount of leverage they may incur and type of assets in which they may invest the foreign private adviser exemption investment advisers who are not holding themselves out to the public in the us as an investment adviser or advising registered funds have no us place of business have fewer than 15 us clients and us investors in total in private funds and have assets under management aum as discussed below from such us clients and us investors of less than us 25 million and the private fund adviser exemption investment advisers solely to private funds with aum of less than us 150 million discussed further below however for non us investment advisers the private fund adviser exemption provides that a non us investment adviser would not be required to register as long as the following is true it has no client that is a us person except for qualifying private funds and any assets managed by such adviser at a place of business in the us are solely attributable to private fund assets the total value of which is less than us 150 million aum includes 100 per cent of any securities portfolios or private funds for which an investment adviser provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services regardless of the nature of the assets held by the portfolio or the private fund in addition aum includes 100 per cent of any proprietary assets assets managed without receiving compensation and any uncalled capital commitments to private funds in determining whether an investment adviser can rely on the private fund adviser exemption the sec considers an investment adviser s principal office and place of business as the location where the investment adviser controls the management of private fund assets although day to day management of certain assets may take place at another location an investment adviser with its principal office and place of business in the us must count all private fund assets including those from non us clients toward the us 150 million limit in calculating aum an investment adviser with its principal office and place of business outside of the us need only count private fund assets it manages at a place of business in the us toward the us 150 million limit an investment adviser provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services with respect to a private equity fund from a place of business in the us if its us place of business has ongoing responsibility to select or make recommendations as to specific securities or other investments the fund may purchase or sell and if such recommendations are accepted by the fund the investment adviser s us place of business is responsible for arranging or effecting the purchase or sale however the sec does not view merely providing research or conducting due diligence to be continuous and regular supervisory or management services at a us place of business if a person outside of the us makes independent investment decisions and implements those decisions therefore a private fund adviser with its principal office and place of business outside of the us that cannot meet the terms of the foreign private adviser exemption because it has raised more than us 25 million from us investors can often rely on the private fund adviser exemption because the type or number of non us clients or the amount of assets managed outside of the us are not taken into account when calculating the aum of an investment adviser with its principal office and place of business outside the us investment advisers relying on the venture capital fund exemption or the private fund adviser exemption are considered to be exempt reporting advisers eras and are required to report with the sec by filing certain portions of form adv part 1 within 60 days of relying on the exemption these portions require disclosure of certain basic information with respect to the investment adviser its activities and the private funds that it advises an adviser s form adv filing must be amended at least annually within 90 days of the end of the investment adviser s fiscal year and more frequently for certain specific changes the sec is authorised to require an era to maintain records and provide reports and to examine such era s records which means an era s books and records are subject to sec inspection the sec has in the past indicated that it intends to examine eras as a part of the sec s routine examination programme eras are not required to file form pf described below investment advisers relying on the foreign private adviser exemption are not required to file reports with the sec in addition to the exemptions described above certain investment advisers are excluded from the definition of investment adviser and thus are not required to register under the advisers act for example a family office which is generally a company owned and controlled by family members that provides investment advice only to family clients and does not hold itself out to the public as an investment adviser is so excluded from the definition on the other hand subject to certain exceptions investment advisers with less than us 100 million in aum are generally prohibited from registering with the sec under the advisers act and must instead register as an investment adviser in the state in which they maintain a principal office and place of business and be subject to examination as an investment adviser by the applicable securities commissioner agency or office form pf a registered investment adviser with at least us 150 million of private fund ie a fund relying on 3 c 1 or 3 c 7 aum is required to file form pf with the sec which requires disclosure of certain information regarding each private fund an investment adviser advises including gross and net asset value gross and net performance use of leverage aggregate value of derivatives a breakdown of the fund s investors by category eg individuals pension funds governmental entities sovereign wealth funds a breakdown of the fund s equity held by the five largest investors and a summary of fund assets and liabilities registered investment advisers to hedge funds are also required to report additional information about the hedge funds they advise including fund strategy counterparty credit risk and use of trading and clearing mechanisms large private fund advisers are required to report more extensive information with the nature of the information dependent upon their strategy additional disclosure requirements apply to registered investment advisers to private equity funds with at least us 2 billion in aum ie large private equity advisers such disclosure requirements focus on fund guarantees of controlled portfolio company obligations leverage of controlled portfolio companies and use of bridge financing for controlled portfolio companies in addition registered investment advisers to hedge funds with at least us 1 5 billion in aum ie large hedge fund advisers must report on an aggregated basis information regarding exposures by asset class geographical concentration and turnover and for hedge funds with a net asset value of at least us 500 million they must also report certain information relating to such fund s investments leverage risk profile and liquidity for registered investment advisers that manage only private equity funds real estate funds and venture capital funds as well as registered investment advisers to hedge funds that have a smaller aum the form has to be filed annually within 120 days of the fiscal year end large hedge fund advisers must file form pf on a quarterly basis within 60 days of the end of each fiscal quarter unlike form adv filings which are available on the sec s website form pf filings are confidential and such information is exempt from requests for information under foia however the sec is required to share information included in form pf filings with the financial stability oversight council and in certain circumstances us congress and other federal departments agencies and self regulatory organisations in each case subject to confidentiality restrictions we note that for purposes of form pf a private fund that is required to pay a performance fee based on unrealised gains to its investment adviser or has the ability to borrow in excess of certain thresholds or sell assets short is deemed to be a per se hedge fund regulation applicable to unregistered advisers even unregistered investment advisers whether eras or not are subject to the general anti fraud provisions of the exchange act the advisers act see question 6 state laws and if required to register as a broker dealer with the financial industry regulatory authority finra see question 11 similar rules promulgated by finra and the sec and many of the analogous state regulatory agencies retain statutory power to bring actions against a private equity fund sponsor under these provisions us commodity futures trading commission cftc regulation the cftc has the authority to regulate commodity pool operators cpos and commodity trading advisers ctas under the us commodity exchange act cftc regulations broadly include most derivatives as commodity interests that cause a private equity fund holding such instruments to be deemed a commodity pool and its operator typically the general partner in the case of a limited partnership to be subject to cftc jurisdiction as a cpo and or its adviser typically the investment adviser to be subject to cftc jurisdiction as a cta and unless an exemption is available to become a member of the national futures association nfa the self regulatory organisation for the commodities and derivatives market the cftc regulations will generally apply on the basis of holding any commodity interest directly or indirectly and as such cpo and cta status should be considered with respect to all investment activities and products including for example private funds real estate investment trusts business development companies separate managed account arrangements and any subsidiary entities alternative investment vehicles and other related entities and accounts cpos managing private equity funds may claim certain exemptions from registration with the cftc which may include no action relief including for cpos of funds of funds real estate investment trusts and business development companies the de minimis exemption under cftc rule 4 13 a 3 providing relief for cpos that engage in limited trading of commodity interests on behalf of a commodity pool and registration lite under cftc rule 4 7 providing relief from certain reporting and record keeping requirements otherwise applicable to a registered cpo if the interests in such pool are offered only to qualified eligible persons which includes a qualified purchaser described in question 24 and non united states persons in a private offering of securities including an offering that complies with rule 506 c under the securities act as described in question 24 and corresponding exemptions are available to ctas of private equity funds the confluence of regulatory measures taken in the post financial crisis period including the expansion of the meaning of commodity interests to include most swaps and the repeal of the broad exemption under cftc rule 4 13 a 4 which was commonly relied upon by cpos of private equity funds that rely on the 3 c 7 exemption from registration under the investment company act ie the qualified purchaser exemption described in question 24 placed additional regulatory pressure on private equity fund sponsors to monitor whether their activities will deem their private equity funds to be commodity pools eg because the funds hedge their currency or interest rate exposure by acquiring swaps and to appropriately assess the registration requirements for cpos and determine whether they meet the de minimis exemption from such registration which requires consideration of a number of factors early in the process of structuring a fund and throughout its term if an exemption or other relief is not available a sponsor of a fund that invests in commodity interests including derivatives may be required to register with the cftc and nfa in which case it will become subject to reporting record keeping advertising ethics training supervisory and other ongoing compliance obligations and certain of its personnel will become subject to certain proficiency requirements eg the series 3 exam and standards of conduct governmental requirements what are the governmental approval licensing or registration requirements applicable to a private equity fund in your jurisdiction does it make a difference whether there are significant investment activities in your jurisdiction the offering and sale of interests in a private equity fund are typically conducted as private placements exempt from the securities registration requirements imposed by the securities act the regulations thereunder and applicable state law in addition most private equity funds require their investors to meet certain eligibility requirements so as to enable the funds to qualify for exemption from regulation as investment companies under the investment company act accordingly there are no approval licensing or registration requirements applicable to a private equity fund that offers its interests in a valid private placement and qualifies for an exemption from registration under the investment company act as a general matter if 25 per cent or more of the total value of any class of equity interests in a private equity fund is held by benefit plan investors disregarding the value of interests held by the sponsor and its affiliates and anyone providing investment advice to the private equity fund and its affiliates unless they themselves are benefit plan investors the private equity fund must be operated to qualify as an operating company such as a venture capital operating company vcoc or a real estate operating company reoc in general for purposes of applying the 25 per cent test the term benefit plan investors includes only those plans and arrangements that are subject to fiduciary responsibility standard of care under title i of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and prohibited transaction rules under title i of erisa and section 4975 of the internal revenue code of 1986 the code such as us corporate pension plans and individual retirement accounts as well as entities whose assets include plan assets such as a fund of funds plans that are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility standard of care under erisa or prohibited transaction rules under erisa and section 4975 of the code such as us governmental pension plans and pension plans maintained by non us corporations are not counted for purposes of the 25 per cent test qualification as a vcoc generally entails the private equity fund having on its initial investment date and annually thereafter at least 50 per cent of the private equity fund s assets valued at cost invested in operating companies as to which the private equity fund obtains direct contractual management rights the private equity fund must exercise such management rights with respect to one or more of such operating companies during the course of each year in the ordinary course of business the sponsor of a private equity fund engaging in certain types of corporate finance or financial advisory services may be required to register as a broker dealer with finra and be subject to similar audit and regulation registration of investment adviser is a private equity fund s manager or any of its officers directors or control persons required to register as an investment adviser in your jurisdiction in the absence of an applicable exemption exception or prohibition a private equity fund s manager will be subject to registration as an investment adviser under the advisers act see question 10 those investment advisers registered under the advisers act whether voluntarily or because an exemption exception or prohibition is not available are subject to a number of substantive reporting and record keeping requirements and rules of conduct that shape the management and operation of their business as well as periodic compliance inspections conducted by the sec as part of the shift towards more systematic regulation and increased scrutiny of the private equity industry the sec continues to focus on the examination of private equity firms certain private equity industry practices have received significant attention from the sec and have led to a number of enforcement actions against private equity fund advisers in recent years areas that the sec has highlighted to be of particular concern include among others the following allocation of expenses to funds or portfolio companies or both without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors including for the compensation of operating partners senior advisers consultants and seconded and other in house employees of private equity fund advisers or their affiliates for providing services other than advisory services to funds or portfolio companies or both full allocation of broken deal expenses to funds instead of separate accounts co investors or co investment vehicles without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors marketing presentations and the presentation of performance information generally receipt by private equity firms of compensation from funds or portfolio companies or both which is outside the typical management fee or carried interest structure without a corresponding management fee offset without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors as well as an acceleration of monitoring fees receipt by private equity firms of transaction based or other compensation for the provision of brokerage services in connection with the acquisition and disposition of portfolio companies without being registered as a broker dealer allocation of investment opportunities among investment vehicles they manage and between such funds and the private equity fund advisers affiliates or employees allocation of co investment opportunities disclosure of other conflicts of interests to investors including those arising out of the outside business activities of a private equity sponsor s employees and directors valuation methods receipt of service provider discounts by private equity firms that are not given to the funds or portfolio companies without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors plans to mitigate or respond to cybersecurity events failure to fully allocate fees from portfolio companies to management fee paying funds to offset such management fees without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors allocation of interest from a loan to the private equity fund adviser only to the adviser or its affiliates without pre commitment disclosure and agreement from investors pay to play violations and late filing of required filings eg form pf fund manager requirements are there any specific qualifications or other requirements imposed on a private equity fund s manager or any of its officers directors or control persons in your jurisdiction there are no particular educational or experience requirements imposed by law on investment advisers although the education and experience of certain of an investment adviser s personnel are disclosable items in the form adv as a matter of market practice the required experience level of an investment adviser s management team will be dictated by the demands of investors if required to register as a broker dealer with finra a private equity fund sponsor would need to satisfy certain standards in connection with obtaining a registration eg no prior criminal acts minimum capital testing etc also a private equity fund s sponsor is typically expected to make a capital investment either directly in or on a side by side basis with the private equity fund but see question 16 with respect to limitations on sponsor commitments in bank sponsored private equity funds investors will expect that a significant portion of this investment be funded in cash as opposed to deferred fee or other arrangements political contributions describe any rules or policies of public pension plans or other governmental entities in your jurisdiction that restrict or require disclosure of political contributions by a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser or their employees the sec has adopted rule 206 4 5 a broad set of rules aimed at curtailing pay to play scandals in the investment management industry the rules subject to certain de minimis exceptions prohibit a registered investment adviser as well as an era and a foreign private adviser covered advisers from providing advice for compensation to any us government entity within two years after the covered adviser or certain of its executives or employees covered associates has made a political contribution to an elected official or candidate who is in a position to influence an investment by the government entity in a fund advised by such investment adviser the rules also make it illegal for the covered adviser itself or through a covered associate to solicit or coordinate contributions for any government official or political party where the investment adviser is providing or seeking to provide investment advisory services for compensation to a government entity in the applicable state or locality investment advisers are also required to monitor and maintain records relating to political contributions made by their employees in addition to the sec rule certain us states including california new mexico new jersey and new york have enacted legislation and certain us public pension plans including the california public employees retirement system calpers the california state teachers retirement system calstrs the new mexico state investment council and the new york state common retirement fund have established policies that impose similar restrictions on political contributions to state officials by investment advisers and covered associates use of intermediaries and lobbyist registration describe any rules or policies of public pension plans or other governmental entities in your jurisdiction that restrict or require disclosure by a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser of the engagement of placement agents lobbyists or other intermediaries in the marketing of the fund to public pension plans and other governmental entities describe any rules that require a fund s investment adviser or its employees and agents to register as lobbyists in the marketing of the fund to public pension plans and governmental entities with effect from 20 august 2017 the sec s pay to play rules discussed above broadly prohibit a covered adviser from making any payment to a third party including a placement agent finder or other intermediary for securing a capital commitment from a us government entity to a fund advised by the investment adviser unless such placement agent is registered under section 15b of the exchange act and subject to pay to play rules adopted by the municipal securities rulemaking board or finra the ban does not apply to payments by the investment adviser to its employees or owners certain us states have enacted legislation regulating or prohibiting the engagement or payment of placement agents by an investment adviser with respect to investment by some or all of such state s pension systems in a fund advised by such investment adviser such regulations and prohibitions vary from state to state for example california has enacted legislation that requires placement agents which can include third party placement agents as well as the investment manager s employees officers directors and other equity holders unless such persons spend at least a third of their time managing the securities or assets invested by the investment adviser to register as lobbyists before soliciting investments from its state level public pension plans calpers calstrs and the university of california to the extent it is investing retirement as opposed to endowment assets the california law also prohibits placement agents from receiving fees that are contingent on securing investments from the plans and requires disclosure of any fixed placement fees or other compensation paid to solicit investments from such state pension plans the california law requiring placement agents to register as lobbyists may also require such registration of certain of an investment adviser s own employees and partners who are involved with the solicitation of investments from the california state pension plans such as marketing or investor relations personnel the compensation paid to such employees and partners of the investment adviser who directly solicit the plan is also required to be disclosed in addition investment advisers who retain third party placement agents to solicit the california state pension plans or whose employees and partners are covered by the lobbyist registration law are considered lobbyist employers under california law and are required to make certain public filings in addition to such placement agents and employees kentucky has also recently adopted registration requirements with respect to placement agents soliciting investments from kentucky state pension plans that are similar to those applicable to california state public pension plans various other states may also have lobbying laws that effectively require investment advisers and their employees who solicit state and local pension plans to register as lobbyists counties cities or other municipal jurisdictions may require lobbyist registration or disclosure or both for example in new york city local rules effectively require investment advisers and their employees who solicit local pension plans to register as lobbyists in addition public pension plans may have their own additional requirements in states where state law does not ban placement agent fees or require disclosure the public pension plans themselves may have such bans or requirements bank participation describe any legal or regulatory developments emerging from the recent global financial crisis that specifically affect banks with respect to investing in or sponsoring private equity funds in 2013 the five us regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the volcker rule provisions of dodd frank approved final rules the final rules that generally prohibit banking entities from acquiring or retaining any ownership in or sponsoring a private equity fund and engaging in proprietary trading on 24 may 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the reform act was enacted and among other financial regulatory changes modified the volcker rule s banking entity definition for purposes of the volcker rule as implemented by the final rules and as amended by the reform act the term banking entity means any insured depository institution other than certain limited purpose trust institutions and insured depository institutions that do not have and are not controlled by a company that has more than us 10 billion in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and trading liabilities that are more than 5 per cent of total consolidated assets any company that controls such an insured depository institution any company that is treated as a bank holding company for purposes of the international banking act such as a foreign bank that has a us branch agency or commercial lending subsidiary and any affiliate or subsidiary of such entities there are a number of exceptions to the basic prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring private equity funds in particular banking entities are permitted to invest in covered private funds that they sponsor provided that the investment does not exceed 3 per cent of the fund s total ownership interest on a per fund basis or 3 per cent of the banking entity s tier 1 capital on an aggregate basis and provided that certain other conditions are met for these purposes covered funds generally include funds that would be investment companies but for the exemptions provided by section 3 c 1 or section 3 c 7 of the investment company act in june 2018 the five us regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the volcker rule proposed certain limited modifications to the final rules but whether such administrative modifications will be adopted or in what ultimate form is uncertain taxation tax obligations would a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction be subject to taxation there with respect to its income or gains would the fund be required to withhold taxes with respect to distributions to investors please describe what conditions if any apply to a private equity fund to qualify for applicable tax exemptions generally a private equity fund vehicle such as a limited partnership or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes would not itself be subject to taxation with respect to its income or gains instead each partner would take into account its distributive share of the partnership s income gain loss and deduction however liability for adjustments to a fund s tax returns may be imposed on the fund itself in certain circumstances in the absence of an election to the contrary if the fund generates income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business eci including as a result of an investment in us real estate or certain real estate companies the fund will be required to withhold us federal income tax with respect to such income that is attributable to the fund s non us investors regardless of whether it is distributed in general subject to an exception for investments in certain real estate companies trading in stock or securities the principal activity of most private equity funds is not treated as generating eci gain or loss from the sale or exchange of an interest in a fund by a foreign partner will be considered eci and therefore subject to us tax to the extent that such partner would have been allocated eci if the fund sold all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the sale or exchange recently enacted tax reform legislation the tax reform bill would also require the transferee of an interest in a partnership engaged in a us trade or business to withhold 10 per cent of the amount realised by the transferor on the sale or exchange and the fund would be required to withhold from future distributions to the transferee if the transferee fails to properly withhold funds that hold investments that generate eci often allow non us investors to participate through one or more entities treated as corporations for us tax purposes with respect to such investments in which case such corporations would file us tax returns and pay tax associated with such eci investments non us investors may still be subject to us withholding tax on dividends and or interest paid by such corporations the fund will also be required to withhold with respect to its non us investors distributive share of certain us source income of the fund that is not eci eg us source dividends and interest unless in the case of interest such interest qualifies as portfolio interest portfolio interest generally includes with certain exceptions interest paid on registered obligations with respect to which the beneficial owner provides a statement that it is not a us person a non us investor who is a resident for tax purposes in a country with respect to which the us has an income tax treaty may be eligible for a reduction or refund of withholding tax imposed on such investor s distributive share of interest and dividends and certain foreign government investors may also be eligible for an exemption from withholding tax on income of the fund that is not from the conduct of commercial activities the foreign account tax compliance act requires all entities in a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions ffis to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or be subject to a 30 per cent withholding tax on certain payments this legislation also requires non us entities that are not ffis either to certify they have no substantial us beneficial ownership or to report certain information with respect to their substantial us beneficial ownership or be subject to a 30 per cent withholding tax on certain payments this legislation could apply to non us investors in the fund and the private equity fund could be required to withhold on payments to such investors if such investors do not comply with the applicable requirements of this legislation the taxation of a private equity fund vehicle as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes is subject to certain rules regarding publicly traded partnerships that could result in the partnership being classified as an association taxable as a corporation to avoid these rules funds are not commonly traded on a securities exchange or other established over the counter market and impose limitations on the transferability of interests in the private equity fund vehicle local taxation of non resident investors would non resident investors in a private equity fund be subject to taxation or return filing requirements in your jurisdiction non resident investors that invest directly in a private equity fund organised as a flow through vehicle in the us would be subject to us federal income taxation and return filing obligations if the private equity fund or an entity organised as a flow through vehicle into which the private equity fund invests generates eci including gain from the sale of real property or stock in certain us real estate property holding corporations see question 17 in addition all or a portion of the gain on the disposition including by redemption by a non us investor of its interest in the fund may be taxed as eci similar us state and local income tax requirements may also apply local tax authority ruling is it necessary or desirable to obtain a ruling from local tax authorities with respect to the tax treatment of a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction are there any special tax rules relating to investors that are residents of your jurisdiction generally no tax ruling would be obtained with respect to the tax treatment of a private equity fund vehicle formed in the us while there are many special taxation rules applicable to us investors of particular relevance are those rules that apply to us tax exempt investors in respect of unrelated business taxable income ubti organisational taxes must any significant organisational taxes be paid with respect to private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction there are no significant taxes associated with the organisation of a private equity fund in the us special tax considerations please describe briefly what special tax considerations if any apply with respect to a private equity fund s sponsor special consideration is given to structure the carried interest such that it is treated as a partnership allocation eligible for taxation on a flow through basis it is sometimes desirable to separate the general partner namely the recipient of the carried interest and the investment manager namely the recipient of the management fee into separate entities see question 32 under the tax reform bill the fund must have a three year holding period rather than the standard one year holding period for an investment or asset in order for carried interest distributions to be eligible for favourable long term capital gain treatment in addition an individual carried interest participant will only be eligible for long term capital gain treatment upon disposition of any interests in a carry vehicle other than capital interests if such participant has a three year holding period for the interests further congress has previously proposed legislation that if enacted would result in carried interest distributions that are currently subject to favourable capital gains tax treatment being subject to higher rates of us federal income tax than are currently in effect whether such legislation would be enacted in addition to changes in the tax reform bill is uncertain in addition some sponsors implement arrangements in which a sponsor waives its right to all or a portion of management fees in order for it or an affiliate to receive an additional distributive share of the private equity fund s returns proposed regulations if finalised could treat participants in such management fee waiver arrangements as receiving compensatory payments for services rather than allocations of the fund s underlying income the preamble to the proposed regulations also indicates that existing safe harbours that treat the grant of a profits interest as a non taxable event may not apply to management fee waiver arrangements tax treaties please list any relevant tax treaties to which your jurisdiction is a party and how such treaties apply to the fund vehicle the us has an extensive network of income tax treaties how a treaty would apply to the fund vehicle depends on the terms of the specific treaty and the relevant facts of the structure other significant tax issues are there any other significant tax issues relating to private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction the tax reform bill has resulted in fundamental changes to the tax code among the numerous changes included in the tax reform bill are a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense an income deduction for individuals receiving certain business income from pass through entities changes in the treatment of carried interest which generally requires the fund to have a three year holding period for an investment or asset in order for carried interest distributions to be eligible for favourable long term capital gain treatment as further described in question 21 a partial shift of the us taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system along with a transitional rule that taxes certain historical accumulated earnings and rules that prevent tax planning strategies that shift profits to low tax jurisdictions and a suspension of certain miscellaneous itemised deductions including deductions for investment fees and expenses until 2026 the partial limit on the deductibility of business interest expense disallows deductions for business interest expense even if paid to third parties in excess of the sum of business interest income and 30 per cent of the adjusted taxable income of the business business interest includes any interest on indebtedness related to a trade or business but excludes investment interest to which separate limitations apply the impact of the tax reform bill on funds and their portfolio companies is uncertain us tax rules are very complex and tax matters play an extremely important role in both fund formation and the structure of underlying fund investments consultation with tax advisers with respect to the specific transactions or issues is highly recommended selling restrictions and investors generally legal and regulatory restrictions describe the principal legal and regulatory restrictions on offers and sales of interests in private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction including the type of investors to whom such funds or private equity funds formed in other jurisdictions may be offered without registration under applicable securities laws in your jurisdiction exemptions from requirement to register fund interests to ensure that a private equity fund offering securities in the us will satisfy the requirements necessary to avoid registration of the interests in the fund with the sec a private equity fund sponsor will customarily conduct the offering and sale of interests in the private equity fund to meet a private placement exemption under the securities act the most reliable way to do this is to comply with the safe harbour criteria established by rule 506 under regulation d under the securities act offers and sales of securities that comply with regulation d will not be deemed to be a transaction that involves a public offering the applicability of the exemptions will depend on the manner of the offering under the rule 506 b exemption the private equity fund sponsor must not make any offers or sales by means of general solicitation or general advertising in addition the private equity fund cannot have more than 35 non accredited investors each such non accredited investor either individually or with a representative must also be sophisticated ie must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial or business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the potential investment under the rule 506 c exemption the private equity sponsor may broadly solicit and generally advertise the offering so long as among other requirements reasonable steps are implemented to ensure that each investor in the private equity fund is an accredited investor at the time of the sale of securities to that investor an accredited investor as defined in rule 501 under regulation d generally includes a natural person with a net worth either individually or jointly with a spouse of more than us 1 million or income above us 200 000 in the past two years or us 300 000 in joint income with a spouse for those two years and a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year and certain entities with more than us 5 million in total assets for purposes of the us 1 million net worth test described above the value of the investor s primary residence is excluded from the calculation of the investor s total assets and the amount of any mortgage or other indebtedness secured by an investor s primary residence is similarly excluded from the calculation of the investor s total liabilities except to the extent the estimated fair market value of the residence is less than the amount of such mortgage or other indebtedness there is also a timing provision in the net worth test designed to prevent investors from artificially inflating their net worth by incurring incremental indebtedness secured by their primary residence to acquire assets that would be included in the net worth calculation under the timing provision if a borrowing occurs in the 60 days preceding the purchase of securities in an exempt offering and is not in connection with the purchase of the primary residence the amount of such incremental indebtedness must be treated as a liability for the net worth calculation the sec is authorised to adjust the accredited investor definition for individuals every four years as may be appropriate to protect investors further the public interest or otherwise reflect changes in the prevailing economy rule 506 c provides some non exclusive non mandatory methods of verifying that a natural person is accredited eg reviewing tax returns or bank account statements and to the extent these methods are not used or a sponsor is verifying the accredited investor status of an entity in determining whether the steps taken by an issuer to verify eligibility are objectively reasonable sponsors should consider the particular facts and circumstances of each offering and each purchaser including the following the nature of the purchaser and the type of accredited investor that the purchaser claims to be the amount and type of information that the issuer has about the purchaser and the nature terms and manner of the offering given that these increased verification measures with respect to sales under rule 506 c generally result in increased compliance burdens and costs for issuers and in some cases investors are reluctant to provide or are sensitive about providing the additional information required as part of the enhanced verification procedures private equity firms are not yet widely relying on the rule 506 c exemption and this exemption is not expected to play a significant role in private equity fundraising in the future another factor impeding utilisation of the rule 506 c exemption by private equity firms is that the use of general solicitation in reliance on rule 506 c may affect other aspects of a private equity sponsor s regulatory compliance regime for example it is possible that the use of general solicitation or general advertising by a private equity fund under rule 506 c could have an adverse impact on its private placement under the securities laws of other jurisdictions in which it conducts its offering as the securities laws thereof may not permit general solicitation in their current form the potential impact of pending sec proposed amendments to rule 506 would also create additional burdens for reliance on rule 506 c a private equity fund relying on a private placement exemption contained in regulation d under the securities act must file electronically with the sec a notice on form d within 15 calendar days after the date of first sale of securities form d sets forth certain basic information about the offering including the amount of securities offered and sold as well as whether any sales commissions were paid to any broker dealers and if so the states in which purchases were solicited by such broker dealer for purposes of the form d filing deadline the sec considers the first date of sale to occur on the date on which the first investor is irrevocably contractually committed to invest therefore depending on the terms and conditions of the contract such date could be deemed to be the date on which a private equity fund receives its first investor subscription agreement and not necessarily the typically later closing date the sec has proposed amendments to regulation d which would impose additional procedural requirements on issuers seeking to rely on rule 506 c to engage in a general solicitation by requiring that an initial form d with heightened disclosure requirements be filed at least 15 days before commencing any such general solicitation and that a final amendment to form d be filed within 30 days of the termination of any such offering under other proposed amendments failure to comply with the form d filing requirements whether or not involving a general solicitation would result in an automatic one year disqualification from relying on a rule 506 exemption in addition to federal securities law compliance most states have similar notice filing requirements while state registration of securities is pre empted under the securities act private equity sponsors should be cognisant of the state law notice filing requirements in the various jurisdictions in which they will or have offered or sold limited partnership interests to investors many states require a notice filing consisting of a copy of a form d and a filing fee to be made within 15 calendar days after the date of first sale in the state anti fraud provisions under applicable state laws apply despite the pre emption described above under rule 506 d issuers are prohibited from relying on the rule 506 exemptions whether or not the proposed offering involves a general solicitation if the issuer or any other covered person was subject to a disqualifying event covered persons include the issuer and its predecessors affiliated issuers ie issuers that issue securities in the same offering such as parallel funds and related feeder funds directors and certain officers general partners and managing members of the issuer beneficial owners of 20 per cent or more of an issuer s outstanding voting equity securities calculated on the basis of voting power which could include limited partners in related private equity funds if the issuer and such related fund vote together any investment manager to a pooled investment fund issuer any promoter connected with the issuer in any capacity at the time of the sale and any persons compensated directly or indirectly for soliciting investors eg placement agents as well as the general partners directors officers and managing members of any such investment manager or compensated solicitor for purposes of these bad actor rules disqualifying events include certain criminal convictions court injunctions and restraining orders final orders of state and federal regulators sec disciplinary orders stop orders and cease and desist orders suspension or expulsion from a securities self regulatory organisation and us postal service false representation orders a number of these disqualifying events are required to occur in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and include a look back period of five to 10 years depending on the particular facts surrounding the disqualifying event disqualification is not triggered by actions taken in jurisdictions other than the us while only disqualifying events that occur after the rule s effective date 23 september 2013 will disqualify an issuer from relying on a rule 506 exemption rule 506 e provides that disqualifying events that occurred prior to such date but within the applicable look back period would nonetheless be required to be disclosed to investors in connection with any sales of securities under rule 506 within a reasonable time prior to such sale under rule 506 e a failure to provide this disclosure will not prevent an issuer from relying on a rule 506 exemption if an issuer can show that it did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known that the issuer or any other covered person was subject to a disqualifying event although this reasonable care exception requires factual inquiry into whether any disqualifications exist this factual inquiry will depend on the facts and circumstances concerning among other things the issuer and the other offering participants additionally the sec may grant waivers from disqualification under certain circumstances including if the issuer has undergone a change of control subsequent to the disqualifying event exemptions from requirement to register funds to ensure that a private equity fund will satisfy the requirements necessary to avoid regulation as an investment company under the investment company act the fund must be excluded from the definition of investment company under section 3 c 7 of the investment company act each investor in the fund will typically be required to represent that it is a qualified purchaser in the event that not all of a private equity fund s investors are qualified purchasers the fund may still be excluded from the definition of an investment company under section 3 c 1 of the investment company act by limiting the number of investors to not more than 100 all of which must still be accredited investors for regulation d purposes and with respect to which certain look through attribution rules apply a qualified purchaser as defined in section 2 a 51 a of the investment company act generally includes a natural person or a company owned directly or indirectly by two or more natural related persons who owns not less than us 5 million in investments a company acting for its own account or the accounts of other qualified purchasers that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis not less than us 25 million in investments and certain trusts in order to rely on section 3 c 1 or 3 c 7 a private equity fund sponsor must not be making or presently proposing to make a public offering one way that a sponsor can meet this requirement is by complying with regulation d as described above certain rules under the investment company act provide additional clarification for the above requirements rule 3c 5 under the investment company act provides that knowledgeable employees namely executive officers and directors of the sponsor and most investment professionals who as part of their regular functions or duties have been participating in the private equity fund s investment activities or substantially similar functions or duties for another fund for at least 12 months are ignored for the purposes of the 100 person limit for purposes of section 3 c 1 and the qualified purchaser requirement for purposes of section 3 c 7 similarly for funds organised outside the us the sec staff has taken the position that non us investors are generally ignored for purposes of the 100 person limit of section 3 c 1 and the qualified purchaser requirement of section 3 c 7 for real estate funds section 3 c 5 c of the investment company act provides another exclusion from the definition of investment company for any issuer who is primarily engaged in purchasing and acquiring mortgages or other liens in real estate if the sponsor of a private equity fund is a registered investment adviser under the advisers act then in certain circumstances each investor may need to represent that it is a qualified client as defined in rule 205 3 under the advisers act a qualified client generally includes a natural person or company with a net worth exceeding us 2 1 million or that has us 1 million under management with the investment adviser although the sec is required every five years to adjust these dollar amounts for inflation excluding the value attributable to such person s primary residence as further described above a qualified client also includes both qualified purchasers as defined in the investment company act and nearly all persons that fall under the knowledgeable employee definition above with the exception of an advisory board member who is not included in the definition of qualified client types of investor describe any restrictions on the types of investors that may participate in private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction other than those imposed by applicable securities laws described above other than compliance with certain aspects of the anti money laundering provisions of the usa patriot act the patriot act discussed in question 28 as a general matter there are no such restrictions other than those imposed by applicable securities laws described above or which may arise under the laws of other jurisdictions sponsors of private equity funds may choose to limit participation by certain types of investors in light of applicable legal tax and regulatory considerations and the investment strategy of the fund restrictions may be imposed on the participation of non us investors in a private equity fund in investments by the private equity fund in certain regulated industries eg airlines shipping telecommunications and defence see question 16 with respect to recently enacted restrictions on bank holding companies investing in private equity funds identity of investors does your jurisdiction require any ongoing filings with or notifications to regulators regarding the identity of investors in private equity funds including by virtue of transfers of fund interests or regarding the change in the composition of ownership management or control of the fund or the manager there is generally no requirement to notify the state of delaware or the sec as a result of a change in the identity of investors in a private equity fund formed in delaware including by virtue of transfers of fund interests or regarding the change in the composition of ownership of the fund however in the case of a manager who is an investment adviser registered under the advisers act or an era changes in identity of certain individuals employed by or associated with the investment adviser must be reflected in an amendment to part 1 of the investment adviser s form adv promptly filed with the sec and in certain circumstances a change of management or control of the fund or of the manager or investment adviser may require the consent of the investors in the private equity fund in the event of a change of the general partner of a delaware limited partnership an amendment to the fund s certificate of limited partnership would be required to be filed in delaware and such change would need to be accomplished in accordance with such limited partnership s partnership agreement additionally a private equity fund that makes an investment in a regulated industry such as banking insurance airlines telecommunications shipping defence energy and gaming may be required to disclose the identity and ownership percentage of fund investors to the applicable regulatory authorities in connection with an investment in any such company licences and registrations does your jurisdiction require that the person offering interests in a private equity fund have any licences or registrations generally the sponsor of a private equity fund in the us would not be required to register as a broker or dealer under the exchange act as they are not normally considered to be engaged in the business of brokering or dealing in securities the rules promulgated under the exchange act provide a safe harbour from requiring employees and issuers to register as a broker or dealer subject to certain conditions including such employees not being compensated by payment of commissions or other remunerations based either directly or indirectly on the offering of securities if compensation is directly or indirectly paid to employees of the sponsor in connection with the offering of securities the sponsor may be required to register as a broker dealer see questions 10 and 11 if a private equity fund retains a third party to market its securities that third party generally would be required to be registered as a broker dealer money laundering describe any money laundering rules or other regulations applicable in your jurisdiction requiring due diligence record keeping or disclosure of the identities of or other related information about the investors in a private equity fund or the individual members of the sponsor although private equity funds generally have historically not been subject to the anti money laundering regulations of the patriot act on 25 august 2015 the financial crimes enforcement network fincen a bureau of the us department of the treasury proposed regulations that would impose anti money laundering obligations on investment advisers registered with the sec under the advisers act covered advisers covered advisers would be included in the definition of financial institution in regulations implementing the patriot act and consequently would be required among other things to establish and implement risk based anti money laundering programmes and file suspicious activity reports with fincen the proposed rules do not however include a customer identification programme requirement as required for other financial institutions fincen proposes delegating authority to the sec to examine compliance with the proposed rules although these proposed rules are not currently effective as a best practice many private equity funds have already put into place anti money laundering programmes that meet the requirements set forth in the patriot act s regulations these requirements include the following developing internal policies procedures and controls designating an anti money laundering compliance officer implementing an employee training programme and having an independent audit function to test the programme currently there are no regulations in effect that would require the disclosure of the identities of or other related information about the investors in a private equity fund or the individual members of the sponsor if an investment adviser to a private equity fund is registered under the advisers act the investment adviser must disclose on form adv the educational business and disciplinary background of certain individuals employed by or associated with the investment adviser similar disclosure may be required for investment advisers that are or have affiliates that are broker dealers registered with finra exchange listing listing are private equity funds able to list on a securities exchange in your jurisdiction and if so is this customary what are the principal initial and ongoing requirements for listing what are the advantages and disadvantages of a listing because of certain adverse tax consequences arising from status as a publicly traded partnership and the difficulty that such a listing would impose on being able to establish an exemption from registration under the investment company act private equity funds do not typically list on a securities exchange in the us see also question 17 the applicable listing requirements would be established by the relevant securities exchange restriction on transfers of interest to what extent can a listed fund restrict transfers of its interests as discussed above private equity funds do not typically list on any us exchange however if listed the ability of such a fund to restrict transfers of its interest would be dictated by the listing requirements of the relevant securities exchange as well as the other governing agreements of such fund participation in private equity transactions legal and regulatory restrictions are funds formed in your jurisdiction subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions that affect their participation in private equity transactions or otherwise affect the structuring of private equity transactions completed inside or outside your jurisdiction the primary restrictions concerning the types of investments that a private equity fund may make are typically contained in the private equity fund s limited partnership agreement these restrictions often include limits on the amount of capital typically expressed as a percentage of the fund s capital commitments that may be deployed in any one investment a restriction on participation in hostile transactions certain geographic diversification limits a restriction on investments that generate certain types of tax consequences for investors eg ubti for us tax exempt investors or eci for non us investors a restriction on certain types of investments eg venture capital investments blind pool investments direct investments in real estate or oil and gas assets and so on individual investors in a private equity fund may also have the right either pursuant to the partnership agreement or a side letter relating thereto to be excused from having their capital invested in certain types of investments tobacco military industry etc and to participate in certain types of investments in a certain manner eg to participate in ubti or eci investments through an alternative investment vehicle or an entity treated as a corporation for us federal tax purposes or both there may also be limits on and filing requirements associated with certain types of portfolio investments made by a private equity fund for example investments in certain media companies may implicate the ownership limits and reporting obligations established by the us federal communications commission other similarly regulated industries include shipping defence banking and insurance regulatory considerations applicable to mergers and acquisitions transactions generally eg antitrust tender offer rules etc also apply equally to private equity transactions completed by funds consideration should also be given to the potential applicability of the sarbanes oxley act and applicable us state laws relating to fraudulent conveyance issues as discussed in more detail in the us transactions chapter in addition in general if benefit plan investors hold 25 per cent or more of the total value of any class of equity interests in the private equity fund as described above the private equity fund may to avoid being subject to the fiduciary responsibility standard of care under erisa and prohibited transaction rules under erisa and the code need to structure its investments in a manner so as to ensure that the private equity fund will qualify as a vcoc or an reoc within the meaning of the erisa plan asset regulations qualification as a vcoc generally entails having on its initial investment date and annually thereafter at least 50 per cent of the private equity fund s assets valued at cost invested in operating companies as to which the private equity fund obtains direct contractual management rights and exercising such management rights with respect to one or more of such operating companies during the course of each year in the ordinary course of business compensation and profit sharing describe any legal or regulatory issues that would affect the structuring of the sponsor s compensation and profit sharing arrangements with respect to the fund and specifically anything that could affect the sponsor s ability to take management fees transaction fees and a carried interest or other form of profit share from the fund depending on the state in which a private equity fund is formed and operates there may be tax advantages to forming separate entities to receive the carried interest and management fee and other fee payments in respect of the fund and other unique structuring requirements for example funds whose manager has a place of business in new york city typically use this bifurcated structure additionally as noted in question 21 the tax reform bill requires funds to have a three year holding period rather than the standard one year holding period for an investment or asset in order for carried interest distributions to be eligible for favourable long term capital gain treatment in addition an individual carried interest participant will only be eligible for long term capital gain treatment upon disposition of any interests in a carry vehicle other than capital interests if such participant has a three year holding period for the interests further congress has previously proposed legislation that if enacted would result in typical carried interest distributions being taxed at a higher rate and proposed regulations and related guidance may limit the tax benefits of management fee waiver arrangements moreover tax rules limit a sponsor s ability to use fee deferral arrangements to defer payment of tax on compensation and similar profits allocations the sponsor s ability to take transaction fees is likely to be the subject of negotiation with investors in the fund who may seek to have a portion of such fees accrue for their account as opposed to that of the sponsor through an offset of such fees against the management fee otherwise to be borne by such investors in certain circumstances depending on the structure of a private equity fund the manner in which a sponsor may charge a carried interest or management fee can be affected by the requirements of erisa or the advisers act update and trends recent developments updates and trends although private equity fundraising decreased by 24 per cent in 2018 in comparison with 2017 which was a record year for private equity fundraising private equity fundraising remains healthy according to preqin 1 176 private equity funds reached a final close in 2018 with a total of us 432 billion in commitments private equity fundraising conditions continue to favour established sponsors with strong track records as the industry trend towards consolidation and the flight to quality continues for example the 10 largest private equity funds that reached a final close in 2018 raised 24 per cent of total capital raised in 2018 and private equity funds of us 1 billion or more raised us 264 billion in 2018 according to preqin a key driver of this consolidation has been institutional limited partners often seeking to make larger commitments to fewer funds and consolidating their relationships among a smaller group of fund managers the increased acceleration in the pace of fundraising continued in 2018 with private equity firms returning to the market more quickly than in past years the continued focus on strategic relationships and alternative fundraising strategies including customised and or multi strategy separate account arrangements co investment arrangements umbrella arrangements and other anchor or strategic investments has played a significant role in private equity fundraising in recent years for example a number of established sponsors are raising lower risk longer term funds core funds and a number of sponsors have increased their focus on raising complementary funds eg funds with strategies aimed at particular geographic regions or specific asset types in addition in 2018 gp minority stakes investing played an increased role in private equity fundraising and the secondaries market was highly active as well early closer incentives and other accommodations in terms continued to play an increased role in private equity fundraising in 2018 the strong performance by private equity funds and record distributions to investors in recent years have provided an ongoing source of liquidity for many institutional investors and have led to an increase in overall allocations to private equity for many institutional investors broadening both the breadth and depth of the private equity asset class among investors moreover given that private equity as an asset class has outperformed the public markets and has been more stable relative to the volatility in the public markets in recent years institutional investors may increasingly shift allocations from the public markets to private equity given this funds possess a nearly unprecedented amount of dry powder or capital not yet deployed with us 1 2 trillion on hand as of december 2018 according to preqin as a result of such increased levels of dry powder coupled with the availability of financing the number of private equity deals announced through 2018 reached an all time high and aggregate deal value reached the second highest amount since the global financial crisis however certain private equity sponsors and investors remain concerned about asset pricing as investors continue to consolidate their relationships within the private equity industry and key investors seek to strengthen bonds with certain private equity sponsors dedicated investor relations teams have developed at private equity firms to comply with investors demands for customised rights eg reporting and transparency and increased scrutiny of marketing materials as a result of the strength of private equity fundraising in recent years established sponsors are seeking more sponsor favourable fund terms in an effort to reverse terms put into place around the onset of the global financial crisis and realign interests between themselves and investors it is expected that the sec will continue to focus on transparency eg pre commitment disclosure and consent from investors with respect to conflicts of interests among other matters as a result fund documentation is likely to remain complex and more granular reporting will continue to be provided on a variety of topics including fees and allocation of costs and expenses recent sec enforcement actions and examinations have focused on among other things the allocation of costs and expenses to funds or portfolio companies the allocation of investment opportunities and co investment opportunities the receipt by private equity firms of compensation or other fees or compensation from funds or portfolio companies which are outside of the typical management fee or carried interest the use of fund level leverage plans to mitigate or respond to cybersecurity events the role of technology in private equity and conflicts of interest related thereto and has caused many private equity firms to carefully reconsider and enhance their disclosure and practices with respect thereto continued regulatory constraints particularly among banks and other financial institutions have increased the role played by sovereign wealth funds and high net worth investors eg bank feeders in the private equity asset class a number of the larger and more established private equity firms continue to face distinct firm issues relating to the interplay between their status as public companies and their sponsorship and management of private funds we expect that fundraising for 2019 will remain strong as 3 749 private equity funds are seeking to raise approximately us 972 billion as of the beginning of 2019 despite continuing economic concerns and political volatility according to preqin we also expect that the trends and developments witnessed in 2018 will continue in the near to medium term as the consolidation in the private equity industry continues competition to secure lp capital among private equity funds will remain high and continue to increase in 2019 with alternative fundraising strategies continuing to play a substantial role increasingly risk averse allocation decisions by investors coupled with the volatility in the public markets will continue to allow established sponsors with proven track records to enjoy a competitive advantage finally regulatory constraints are likely to continue to create opportunities for private equity firms and may result in continued opportunity in secondary and private debt businesses of private equity sponsors

approximately 34 5 million the company expects a further sale of precipitate in june 2019 with a value in excess of 10 million following which the precipitate inventory at cerro moro is expected to return to normal levels the company s strong financial position is expected to improve further over the year with the continuation of robust operating results the sale of unrefined gold and silver carried over from both 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 and the expected receipt of 800 million in cash from the recently announced sale of chapada as anticipated cyclical first quarter payments are reflected in the negative movement in working capital from december 31 2018 which include the payment of year end related accruals and timing of regular trades payables precipitate inventory build up at cerro moro and other mines and indirect tax credit build up at certain operations these items also impacted debt and net free cash flow 2 compared to december 31 2018 as anticipated in the company

march 7 2019 the company signed an integration agreement with glencore international ag and newmont goldcorp collectively the parties pursuant to which the agua rica project would be developed and operated using the existing infrastructure and facilities of minera alumbrera limited in the catamarca province of argentina the agreement represents a significant step forward towards the optimization and development of agua rica the alumbrera infrastructure including the existing infrastructure for concentrate logistics located in northern argentina between the mine site and the port presents a unique opportunity to enhance project economics while also reducing both the project complexity and environmental footprint the parties have established a technical committee to direct the review and evaluation of the integrated project it is expected that a pre feasibility study for the integrated project will be completed in mid 2019 and that a full feasibility study with updated mineral reserve production and project cost estimates will be completed by mid 2020 this will provide the framework for the submission of a new environmental impact assessment eia to the authorities of the catamarca province and for the continued engagement with local stakeholders and communities the company is evaluating beginning the eia process in 2019 given the level of significant detail in the pre feasibility study chapada brazil subsequent to the quarter end the company announced a definitive agreement to sell the wholly owned chapada mine to lundin mining corporation for total consideration of over 1 0 billion the sale transaction which reflects chapada s full value including the anticipated plant expansion the sale transaction will enhance the company s position as a dominant intermediate precious metals company with a high quality asset portfolio a robust balance sheet and cash flow profile and peer leading jurisdictional focus the company will have a greater concentration of precious metals while still maintaining significant copper exposure through agua rica upon closing of the sale a significant and immediate improvement to overall financial flexibility is expected to allow for the pursuit of near term value maximizing opportunities that are currently in the company s portfolio and also to increase shareholder returns initially by way of a 100 increase in the annual dividend in summary beyond this enhanced industry position the financial benefits of the sale on closing are expected to be as follows improved financial flexibility the sale is expected to provide a significant improvement to the company s financial flexibility going forward as follows the lower debt levels will result in interest savings in excess of 35 million per annum over the tenure of the debt chapada s five year plan to maintain geo guidance levels included total sustaining and expansionary expenditures of 458 million and 240 million respectively which will now not be incurred by the company while chapada maintains a long life based on mineral inventory it is expected that sustaining and expansionary expenditures would significantly reduce free cash flows during the period that coincides with reduced production particularly for gold resulting in less operating cash flow than in previous periods the company s net free cash flow 2 that would have been required for chapada s sustaining and expansionary capital expenditures can now be applied for the maximization of value enhancing opportunities at the company s other operations including further production at jacobina and canadian malartic and improvements to costs at cerro moro which derive significantly better returns as well as expected costs lower than the previous phase 2 and phase 3 expansion plans for chapada consistent with the company s strategy these opportunities are to be funded organically by cash flows from operations with the expected capital requirements to be covered by net free cash flow 2 immediate leverage reduction the up front cash consideration of 800 million provides for significant deleveraging benefits highlighted by a decline in current net debt leverage ratio to 1 5x from the year end 2018 value of 2 5x with an opportunity for further reductions based on the contingent payments the company is prioritizing the repayment of the outstanding revolving credit facility and then the repayment of near and medium term fixed term debt maturities increased shareholder returns dividend increased the improved balance sheet and interest savings will enable the company as approved by the board of directors and conditional on closing of the sale transaction to double its annual dividend to 0 04 per share this improves returns to shareholders while allowing the company flexibility for further future capital returns the sale transaction is subject to customary regulatory and third party approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019 expansion opportunities at jacobina brazil at jacobina the company has developed a two phase plan to increase production beyond 150 000 geo per year as follows the first phase considers production increases to between 165 000 to 170 000 ounces per year through a mill optimization to 6 500 tonnes per calendar day tpd from the current operating rate of 5 800 tpd this compares to prior year production of roughly 145 000 ounces representing approximately 20 000 25 000 additional ounces of production this phase requires very modest capital and is expected to be implemented by mid 2020 the second phase considers a larger increase in the plant capacity to between 8 000 and 8 500 tpd which would significantly increase production estimated to exceed 225 000 ounces per year with current preliminary estimates of total capital expenditures of 100 million over the expected implementation period up to 2022 expansion opportunities at canadian malartic canada at canadian malartic studies show the potential for production increases of approximately 75 000 geo per year based on yamana s 50 interest with project costs and economics currently under evaluation opportunities at odyssey east malartic sladen and sheehan zones have the potential to provide new sources of ore for the canadian malartic mill the extraction is expected to be by way of underground mining methods with ore fed to the existing malartic mill displacing a portion of the lower grade open pit ores the permit allowing for the development of an underground ramp at the odyssey project was received in december 2018 these opportunities including those for other mines are expected at total costs lower than the previous expansion plans for chapada consistent with the company s strategy these opportunities are to be funded organically by cash flows from operations with the expected capital requirements to be covered by net free cash flow 2 rand malartic acquisition increased canadian malartic land package on march 26 2019 the canadian malartic general partnership acquired the rand malartic property adjacent to the east side of the canadian malartic property the rand malartic property covers 262 hectares and extends 1 7 kilometres eastward along the cadillac larder lake break within the piché group immediately east of the odyssey project the rand malartic property has the same favourable geological features as the odyssey project with several porphyry intrusions in the southernmost portion of piché group volcanic rocks the 39 and 67 zones are porphyry hosted with similar mineralogy and alteration to odyssey the former appears to be geologically continuous with the odyssey south zone in addition the geological environment is similar to the historical malartic gold fields mine located 3 kilometres to the east on the adjoining midway property a budget of 1 9 million on a 100 interest basis has been allocated for the 2019 exploration program at rand malartic including an initial 10 000 metres of drilling to test the eastern extension of the odyssey project and its possible continuity onto the rand malartic property the near surface potential will also be investigated exploration drilling in the first quarter has focused on defining several internal zones in the odyssey deposit and expanding odyssey towards the property boundary with rand malartic construction development and exploration canadian malartic 50 interest canada the canadian malartic extension project is continuing according to plan with contributions from barnat expected to begin in 2019 with more meaningful contributions in 2020 on a 50 ownership interest basis expansionary capital expenditures are expected to be 37 million of which 34 million is earmarked for the extension project in 2019 work continues to focus on the highway 117 road deviation which is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 overburden stripping and rock excavation suyai argentina the company previously completed several studies that evaluated two options for ore processing both of which provide favourable project economics the first considered the construction of a cil processing facility for the on site production of gold and silver in the form of doré the second considered the construction of a processing facility for on site production of gold and silver contained in a high grade concentrate which would be shipped abroad for subsequent precious metal recovery both approaches considered an identical underground configuration with average annual production expected to be in excess of 200 000 ounces of gold and 300 000 ounces of silver the company believes both scenarios address past concerns regarding open pit mining and the development scenario that includes production of an on site concentrate addresses many of the past concerns regarding the use of cyanide and would potentially meet provincial regulations currently in place in chubut the company will work with local stakeholders to obtain and sustain its social license should the project progress to a more advanced stage the company continues to pursue development plans and other strategic alternatives for the project given the extensive amount of work performed to date the existing scoping study could rapidly progress to a feasibility study allowing for the project to be developed in a short time frame the suyai project is a development ready project with significant financial and social benefits to the local community along with the broader provincial and national communities as and when the provincial moratorium on mining lapses and the company has completed favourable engagement with the local community the company would expedite its development plans for the project monument bay canada the monument bay deposits are hosted in the stull lake greenstone belt comprised of three volcanic assemblages ranging in age from 2 85 to 2 71 billion years gold and tungsten mineralization occurs along the steeply north dipping twin lakes shear zone and the az sheer zone in 2019 the focus of exploration is to define drill targets through a thorough re evaluation of the geology and mineralized zones drilling of 5 000 metres is planned as a follow up to the ongoing re log and geological studies other the company continues to pursue development and strategic initiatives for the 56 7 held agua de la falda joint venture with codelco located in northern chile the historical jeronimo feasibility study focused on maximizing production from the sulfide deposits the company completed the study of a low capital start up project based on the remaining oxide inventory with positive results and is evaluating exploration plans on the highly prospective claims surrounding the mine re logging of historical holes and exploratory drilling supported the potential to extend the oxide mineralization as well as potential for copper gold deposits within the joint venture claims agua de la falda has processing capacity and infrastructure already installed exploration continuation of the exploration programs started early in 2019 with the objective of advancing important exploration discoveries at the company s existing operations in the near term the company plans to increase its exploration spending during the year further building mineral reserves and mineral resources at key operations as well as building a pipeline of exploration opportunities to ensure future growth exploration plans will focus on extending mine life at cerro moro el peñón and minera florida while increasing grade mineral resources and mine life at jacobina and canadian malartic to allow increases in production at low costs in particular at jacobina over the course of the year exploration spend will be allocated to support the planned expansion and the program targets new mineral reserves at a grade of 3 0 g t or better health safety environment and corporate responsibility the company s total recordable injury frequency rate was 0 6 for the first quarter of 2019 all yamana operations completed the first month of 2019 with zero lost time injuries this is an improvement from previous years as the first quarter has historically seen higher average rates of health and safety injuries compared with the remainder of the year in conjunction with the local communities and authorities jacobina led an emergency response exercise in february the simulation helps test the preparedness of the mine the community and supporting authorities for serious incidents that could affect the community such as tailings emergencies key statistics key operating and financial statistics for the first quarter 2019 are outlined in the following tables financial

news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in canada which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure requirements of united states securities laws contained in industry guide 7 the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with canadian national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum the cim cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves adopted by the cim council as amended these definitions differ from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the commission contained in industry guide 7 under industry guide 7 standards a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves the three year historical average price is used in any mineral reserve or cash flow analysis to designate mineral reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority in addition the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in and required to be disclosed by ni 43 101 however these terms are not defined terms under industry guide 7 investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations in contrast issuers reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 report mineralization that does not constitute mineral reserves by commission standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures accordingly information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 non gaap financial measures and additional line items and subtotals in financial statements the company has included certain non gaap performance measures to supplement its condensed consolidated interim financial statements which are presented in accordance with ifrs including the following cash costs per geo sold and by product basis cash costs per pound of copper sold all in sustaining costs per geo sold and by product basis all in sustaining costs per pound of copper sold net debt net free cash flow average realized price per ounce of gold silver sold and average realized price per pound of copper sold adjusted earnings the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management s determination of the components of non gaap and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable for definitions and descriptions of the non gaap measures other than those noted and reconciled below and additional subtotals in financial statements refer to section 10 non gaap financial measures and additional line items or subtotals in financial statements of the company s md a for the three months ended march 31 2019 geo production and sales production and sales of silver are treated as a gold equivalent in determining a combined precious metal production or sales unit commonly referred to as gold equivalent ounces geo specifically guidance geo produced are calculated by converting silver production to its gold equivalent using relative gold silver metal prices at an assumed ratio and adding the converted silver production expressed in gold ounces to the ounces of gold production actual geo production and sales calculations are based on an average realized gold to silver price ratio for the relevant period cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities the measure of cash costs and all in sustaining costs aisc along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms cash costs per geo sold cash costs per pound of copper sold aisc per geo sold and aisc per pound of copper sold do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating costs operating profit or cash flows presented under ifrs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis as follows cash costs per geo sold the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cost of sales excluding dda net of treatment and refining charges the attributable cost is calculated net of by products by applying copper and zinc net revenues which are incidental to the production of precious metals as a credit to geo sold thereby allowing the company s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal sales these costs are then divided by geo sold cash costs of copper shown on a per pound basis in the case of chapada costs directly attributable to geo and copper will be allocated on that attributable basis non attributable costs will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues for each metal which will be determined annually at the beginning of each year costs attributable to copper sales are divided by commercial copper pounds sold aisc figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the world gold council wgc a non regulatory market development organization for the gold industry adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies aisc per sold seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing and selling geo from current operations the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cash costs defined above and includes cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures including stripping and underground mine development corporate and mine site general and administrative expense sustaining mine site exploration and evaluation expensed and capitalized and accretion and amortization of reclamation and remediation aisc do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments borrowing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of aisc does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods aisc per geo sold reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the geo production and sales activities but net of by product revenue credits from sales of copper and zinc aisc per pound of copper reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to geo or copper production activities net debt the company uses the financial measure net debt which is a non gaap financial measure to supplement information in its consolidated financial statements the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs the company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the company s performance the non gaap financial measure of net debt does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore it may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs net debt is calculated as the sum of the current and non current portions of long term debt net of the cash and cash equivalent balance as at the balance sheet date a reconciliation of net debt is provided in section 10 of the md a for the three months ended march 31 2019 and comparable period of 2018 which has been filed on sedar net free cash flow the company uses the financial measure net free cash flow which is a non gaap financial measure to supplement information in its consolidated financial statements net free cash flow does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore it may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs the company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the company s performance with respect to its operating cash flow capacity to meet non discretionary outflows of cash the presentation of net free cash flow is not meant to be a substitute for the cash flow information presented in accordance with ifrs but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such ifrs measures net free cash flow is calculated as cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations adjusted for advance payments received pursuant to metal purchase agreements non discretionary expenditures from sustaining capital expenditures and interest and financing expenses paid related to the current period a reconciliation of net free cash flow is provided in section 10 of the md a for the three months ended march 31 2019 and comparable period of 2018 which has been filed on sedar average realized metal prices the company uses the financial measures average realized gold price average realized silver price and average realized copper price which are non gaap financial measures to supplement in its consolidated financial statements average realized price does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs the company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the company s performance vis à vis average market prices of metals for the period the presentation of average realized metal prices is not meant to be a substitute for the revenue information presented in accordance with ifrs but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such ifrs measure average realized metal price represents the sale price of the underlying metal before deducting sales taxes treatment and refining charges and other quotational and pricing adjustments average realized prices are calculated as the revenue related to each of the metals sold i e gold silver and copper divided by the quantity of the respective units of metals sold i e gold ounce silver ounce and copper pound reconciliations of average realized metal prices to revenue are provided in section 10 of the md a for the three months ended march 31 2019 and comparable period of 2018 which has been filed on sedar adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share from continuing operations the company uses the financial measures adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share to supplement information in its consolidated annual financial statements the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs the company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the company s performance the presentation of adjusted measures are not meant to be a substitute for net earnings or loss or net earnings or loss per share presented in accordance with ifrs but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such ifrs measures adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share are calculated as net earnings excluding non recurring items items not related to or having a disproportionate effect on results for a particular periods and or not directly related to the core mining business such as a share based payments and other compensation b unrealized foreign exchange gains losses related to revaluation of deferred income tax asset and liability on non monetary items c unrealized foreign exchange gains losses related to other items d unrealized gains losses on derivatives e impairment losses and reversals on mineral interests and other assets f deferred income tax expense recovery on the translation of foreign currency inter corporate debt g mark to market gains losses on available for sale securities and other assets h one time tax adjustments to historical deferred income tax balances relating to changes in enacted tax rates i reorganization costs j non recurring provisions k gains losses on sale of assets l any other non recurring adjustments and the tax impact of any of these adjustments calculated at the statutory effective rate for the same jurisdiction as the adjustment non recurring adjustments from unusual events or circumstances are reviewed from time to time based on materiality and the nature of the event or circumstance earnings adjustments for the comparative period reflect both continuing and discontinued operations the terms adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore the company s definitions are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management uses these measures for internal valuation of the core mining performance for the period and to assist with planning and forecasting of future operations management believes that the presentation of adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share provide useful information to investors because they exclude non recurring items items not related to or not indicative of current or future period s results and or not directly related to the core mining business and are a better indication of the company s profitability from operations as evaluated by internal management and the board of directors the items excluded from the computation of adjusted earnings or loss and adjusted earnings or loss per share which are otherwise included in the determination of net earnings or loss and net earnings or loss per share prepared in accordance with ifrs are items that the company does not consider to be meaningful in evaluating the company s past financial performance or the future prospects and may hinder a comparison of its period to period profitability additional line items or subtotals in financial statements the company uses the following additional line items and subtotals in the consolidated financial statements as contemplated in ias 1 presentation of financial statements gross margin excluding depletion depreciation and amortization represents the amount of revenue in excess of cost of sales excluding depletion depreciation and amortization this additional measure represents the cash contribution from the sales of metals before all other operating expenses and dda in the reporting period mine operating earnings represents the amount of revenue in excess of cost of sales excluding depletion depreciation and amortization and depletion depreciation and amortization operating earnings represents the amount of earnings before net finance income expense and income tax recovery expense this measure represents the amount of financial contribution net of all expenses directly attributable to mining operations and overheads finance income finance expense and foreign exchange gains losses are not classified as expenses directly attributable to mining operations cash flows from operating activities before income taxes paid and net change in working capital excludes the payments made during the period related to income taxes and tax related payments and the movement from period to period in working capital items including trade and other receivables other assets inventories trade and other payables working capital and income taxes can be volatile due to numerous factors such as the timing of payment and receipt as the company uses the indirect method prescribed by ifrs in preparing its statement of cash flows this additional measure represents the cash flows generated by the mining business to complement the gaap measure of cash flows from operating activities which is adjusted for income taxes paid and tax related payments and the working capital change during the reporting period cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital excludes the movement from period to period in working capital items including trade and other receivables other assets inventories trade and other payables working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors such as the timing of payment and receipt as the company uses the indirect method prescribed by ifrs in preparing its statement of cash flows this additional measure represents the cash flows generated by the mining business to complement the gaap measure of cash flows from operating activities which is adjusted for the working capital change during the reporting period cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital normalized due to copper advanced sales program excludes the impact due to the copper advanced sales program payments and deliveries that results in timing differences between the cash payment and delivery the company s management believes that their presentation provides useful information to investors because gross margin excluding depletion depreciation and amortization excludes the non cash operating cost item i e depreciation depletion and amortization cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital excludes the movement in working capital items mine operating earnings excludes expenses not directly associated with commercial production and operating earnings excludes finance and tax related expenses and income recoveries these in management s view provide useful information of the company s cash flows from operating activities and are considered to be meaningful in evaluating the company s past financial performance or the future prospects

record on june 1 2019 toronto may 2 2019 prnewswire norbord inc tsx andnyse osb today reported adjusted ebitda of 42 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 70 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 170 million in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease versus both comparative periods was primarily due to lower north american oriented strand board osb prices north american operations generated adjusted ebitda of 23 million compared to 50 million in the prior quarter and 156 million in the same quarter last year european operations delivered adjusted ebitda of 21 million compared to 24 million in the prior quarter and 18 million in the same quarter last year the pace of us housing construction began to decelerate in the second half of last year and this trend carried over into the first quarter said peter wijnbergen norbord s president and ceo further the seasonally slowest time of year was exacerbated by unusually wet weather in many of our north american operating regions combined these factors led to very disappointing market conditions and prompted us to take extensive downtime across our north american mills this negatively impacted our production volumes and manufacturing costs us housing demand has clearly pulled back in the last nine months and the market has yet to recover in terms of volume we remain of the view that this is a pause rather than a directional shift us housing fundamentals remain supportive and we have already seen some of the negative trends that caused the housing pullback reverse mortgage rates have improved home builders are starting to offer more entry level homes to help first time buyers and home builder sentiment is improving although the pick up in demand that typically coincides with the spring building season has been late in coming housing demand is setting up for a stronger second half in europe our panel business had another good quarter delivering 17 more adjusted ebitda year over year due to continued strong osb demand in our key markets and the ramp up of our modernized and expanded inverness scotland mill the second phase of investment at inverness is now underway and will help us serve growing

conditions in north america us housing demand was negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates and new home prices as well as record rainfall across the us which constrained homebuilding activity year to date us housing starts were down 10 versus the same period in 2018 with single family starts which use approximately three times more osb than multifamily decreasing by 5 the seasonally adjusted annualized rate was 1 14 million in march which is 14 lower than the pace at this time last year while the pace of housing permits the more forward looking indicator was 1 27 million the consensus forecast from us housing economists is approximately 1 26 million starts for 2019 in line with last year north american benchmark osb prices in all regions weakened due to the pullback in demand from homebuilding as a result average benchmark prices were lower than both the prior quarter and the same quarter last year the table below summarizes average benchmark osb prices per msf 7 16 inch basis

in europe panel markets remained strong driven by continued osb demand growth in norbord s core geographies in local currency terms average panel prices were down a modest 3 from the prior quarter due to seasonality and sales mix but up 5 versus the same quarter last year performance north american osb shipments increased 3 year over year due to six additional fiscal days in the current quarter and were 2 lower quarter over quarter due to the timing of annual maintenance and other downtime norbord s specialty sales volume including industrial and export markets represents approximately 25 of the company s north american osb sales volume excluding the curtailed chambord quebec mill norbord s operating north american osb mills produced at 85 of stated capacity compared to 89 in the prior quarter and 94 in the same quarter last year capacity utilization decreased versus both comparative periods as a result of the year end restatement of annual production capacities at a number of mills norbord s north american osb cash production costs per unit before mill profit share decreased 1 versus the prior quarter but increased 3 compared to the same quarter last year due to the timing of annual maintenance and other downtime in addition lower resin prices had some impact quarter over quarter while year over year higher fibre and energy prices were a factor in europe norbord s shipments were 15 higher than the prior quarter and 13 higher than the same quarter last year the european mills produced at 89 of stated capacity in the quarter unchanged from the prior quarter and compared to 86 in the same quarter last year capacity utilization was unchanged quarter over quarter as the new finishing line at the inverness scotland osb mill was being commissioned during the first quarter of 2019 capacity utilization increased year over year due to the continued ramp up of the reinvested inverness mill following its start up in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company did not generate any mip gains in the quarter as improved productivity and lower raw material usage at the restarted huguley alabama and expanded inverness scotland mills were offset by the timing of annual maintenance shuts and other downtime as well as the operating impact of severe winter weather this year mip is measured relative to the prior year at constant prices and exchange rates capital investments including intangible assets were 30 million in the first quarter compared to 60 million in the prior quarter and 50 million in the same quarter last year the decreases versus both comparative quarters are primarily attributable to the timing of executing on various capital projects including the inverness project included in capital investments is 2 million of the 46 million 35 million budget for the second phase investment to further expand capacity at the inverness scotland mill by 225 mmsf 3 8 inch basis 200 000 cubic metres through the addition of a second wood room and dryer this project is expected to take approximately two years to complete and is consistent with the company s strategy of growing its european osb capacity to serve rapid consumption growth in its key markets at the chambord quebec mill rebuild project 9 million of the 71 million budget was invested in the quarter 36 million project to date norbord believes north american osb demand will continue to grow in order to support this anticipated growth and enhance the competitive position of the company s overall manufacturing operations norbord is rebuilding and preparing the chambord quebec mill for an eventual restart the company has not yet made a restart decision however and will only do so when it is sufficiently clear that customers require more product this project involves replacing the dryers and investing in the wood handling and finishing areas to streamline the mill s manufacturing process and reduce costs as well as upgrades to process and personal safety systems electrical systems and environmental equipment that will bring the mill up to current standards after a decade of curtailment norbord s 2019 capital expenditure budget is approximately 150 million for projects focused on reducing manufacturing costs across the mills as well as a portion of the chambord quebec mill rebuild and inverness scotland phase 2 projects it also includes investments to support the company s strategy to increase the production of specialty products for industrial applications and exports operating working capital was 183 million at quarter end compared to 218 million at the end of the same quarter last year and 88 million at year end 2018 the year over year decrease is primarily due to lower north american osb prices as well as timing of payments and new lease liabilities recognized upon transition to the new lease accounting standard the quarter over quarter increase is primarily due to the annual seasonal build of log inventory in the northern mills in north america the payment of annual incentive payouts as well as the timing of payments working capital continues to be managed at minimal levels across the company at quarter end norbord had unutilized available liquidity of 239 million consisting of 2 million in cash and 237 million in revolving bank lines the company s tangible net worth was 1 107 million and net debt to total

shareholders of record on june 1 2019 unchanged from the prior quarter s level the board reduced the variable dividend level in the prior quarter in response to weaker than expected north american benchmark osb prices as well as the 141 million of capital allocated to common share repurchases from november 2018 through january 2019 norbord believes the recent pullback in us housing demand is temporary and that the fundamentals underlying osb demand remain supportive any dividends reinvested on june 21 2019 under the company s dividend reinvestment plan will be used by the transfer agent

first quarter of 2019 the seasonally slowest time of year was further exacerbated this quarter by persistent poor building weather in many of our north american operating regions which broke numerous cold snowfall and rainfall records as a result we took extensive downtime across our north american mills while it was appropriate to adjust our production to demand this translated into lower volumes and higher manufacturing costs which negatively impacted our first quarter financial results us housing demand has clearly pulled back in the last nine months and the market has yet to recover in terms of volume however we remain of the view that this is a pause rather than a directional shift the fundamentals underlying the housing market a key driver of osb demand remain supportive and conditions are slowly improving both seasonally and due to improving affordability mortgage rates are down from their recent highs new home prices have moderated and builders are offering record levels of incentives for buyers home builders are forecasting to build 3 5 more new houses this year and some are starting to increase their offerings of moderately priced entry level homes to entice first time buyers the meaningful wage growth we re seeing will also support increasing housing demand as the millennial cohort can now start to form households of their own the uptick in demand that usually coincides with the spring building season has been delayed by the prolonged poor weather and has yet to translate into a stronger osb market although the current tight labour market makes it unlikely that builders will be able to recover the lost ground from the slow start to the year us housing experts forecast the pace of construction activity will accelerate with seasonally adjusted permits still tracking near 1 3 million in 2019 in europe our panel business had another solid performance with 13 higher sales volumes year over year due to continued strong osb demand the outlook in europe has remained more positive and our european business is poised for another good year with the investment to further expand our inverness scotland mill now underway we will be in position to meet growing demand for several years to come despite the disappointing results the benefit of our focus on more stable margin specialty products was evident during the past two quarters when we saw significantly higher north american osb price realizations relative to the weak benchmark prices we have a strong balance sheet with comfortable liquidity our mills are positioned to support housing market growth but in the meantime we continue to prioritize diversifying our product mix and expanding our european business finally we remain focused on shareholder value buying back almost 40 million of our shares during the quarter which exhausted our normal course issuer bid limit we look forward to reporting on our progress next quarter and thank our shareholders for their continuing

times net debt to last twelve months ebitda ternium s operating income in the first quarter 2019 was 307 3 million reflecting a weaker pricing environment in ternium s main steel markets and relatively low shipment levels in the southern region operating income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 75 4 million sequentially mainly due to a 35 decrease in steel revenue per ton partially offset by a 241 000 ton increase in steel shipments this increase in steel volume was the result of a 264 000 ton increase in other markets mainly due to higher slab shipments to third parties and a 40 000 ton increase in mexico partially offset by a 63 000 ton decrease in the southern region reflecting lower shipments in argentina due to a combination of weaker steel demand a destocking process in the value chain and the negative effect of seasonality compared to the first quarter 2018 the company s operating income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 139 0 million due mainly to an year over year 91 increase in the steel segment s operating cost per ton6 and a 318 000 ton decrease in steel shipments partially offset by a 61 increase in steel revenue per ton the increase in steel cost per ton mainly reflected higher purchased slab raw material and maintenance costs the decrease in steel volume was the result of a 211 000 ton decrease in mexico mainly due to a weaker commercial market and a 203 000 ton decrease in the southern region reflecting lower steel demand in argentina partially offset by a 96 000 ton increase in other markets due in part to higher slab shipments to third parties the company s net income in the first quarter 2019 was 224 9 million compared to net income of 435 4 million in the fourth quarter 2018 net income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 210 5 million mainly due to the lower operating income lower financial results lower results from equity in earnings of usiminas and higher effective tax rate the sequential decrease in financial results mainly reflected the effects of the fluctuation of the local currency against the u s dollar on ternium s argentine and mexican subsidiaries lower inflation adjustment gains in connection with ternium argentina s monetary position and lower derivative contract results in connection with currency risk management positions the increase in effective tax rate in the first quarter 2019 mainly reflected a non recurrent 104 1 million tax gain in the fourth quarter 2018 due to the effect of a tax asset revaluation at ternium s argentine subsidiary relative to the prior year period net income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 151 7 million mainly due to the lower operating income and higher effective tax rate partially offset by better financial results the year over year improvement in financial results mainly reflected lower net indebtedness and average interest rates the increase in effective tax rate in the first quarter 2019 mainly reflected the changes in deferred taxes produced by the mexican peso s appreciation against the u s dollar which was lower in the first quarter 2019 than in the first quarter 2018 outlook ternium expects ebitda to decrease slightly in the second quarter 2019 compared to the first quarter 2019 as a result of a lower normalizing steel margin partially offset by moderately higher shipments the company will remain focused on maximizing efficiency throughout its production value chain in mexico ternium anticipates realized steel prices will decline further in the second quarter of the year mainly due to the delayed effect of industrial customer s quarterly reset of contract prices which will continue reflecting a protracted steel price downturn between july 2018 and january 2019 overall the mexican industrial market should continue to exhibit steady steel demand in the second quarter of the year coupled with moderate destocking at some automotive service centers the mexican commercial market s performance should remain sluggish due to continued low construction activity which affects the company s shipments in the country in argentina despite a weak economic forecast shipments are expected to sequentially increase during the second quarter 2019 this anticipated increase should result from the gradual recovery of the local steel market and the eventual conclusion of the destocking in the country s steel industry value chain analysis of first quarter 2019 results net gain attributable to ternium s equity owners in the first quarter 2019 was 218 2 million compared to net gain attributable to ternium s

times net debt to last twelve months ebitda ternium s operating income in the first quarter 2019 was 307 3 million reflecting a weaker pricing environment in ternium s main steel markets and relatively low shipment levels in the southern region operating income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 75 4 million sequentially mainly due to a 35 decrease in steel revenue per ton partially offset by a 241 000 ton increase in steel shipments this increase in steel volume was the result of a 264 000 ton increase in other markets mainly due to higher slab shipments to third parties and a 40 000 ton increase in mexico partially offset by a 63 000 ton decrease in the southern region reflecting lower shipments in argentina due to a combination of weaker steel demand a destocking process in the value chain and the negative effect of seasonality compared to the first quarter 2018 the company s operating income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 139 0 million due mainly to an year over year 91 increase in the steel segment s operating cost per ton6 and a 318 000 ton decrease in steel shipments partially offset by a 61 increase in steel revenue per ton the increase in steel cost per ton mainly reflected higher purchased slab raw material and maintenance costs the decrease in steel volume was the result of a 211 000 ton decrease in mexico mainly due to a weaker commercial market and a 203 000 ton decrease in the southern region reflecting lower steel demand in argentina partially offset by a 96 000 ton increase in other markets due in part to higher slab shipments to third parties the company s net income in the first quarter 2019 was 224 9 million compared to net income of 435 4 million in the fourth quarter 2018 net income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 210 5 million mainly due to the lower operating income lower financial results lower results from equity in earnings of usiminas and higher effective tax rate the sequential decrease in financial results mainly reflected the effects of the fluctuation of the local currency against the u s dollar on ternium s argentine and mexican subsidiaries lower inflation adjustment gains in connection with ternium argentina s monetary position and lower derivative contract results in connection with currency risk management positions the increase in effective tax rate in the first quarter 2019 mainly reflected a non recurrent 104 1 million tax gain in the fourth quarter 2018 due to the effect of a tax asset revaluation at ternium s argentine subsidiary relative to the prior year period net income in the first quarter 2019 decreased 151 7 million mainly due to the lower operating income and higher effective tax rate partially offset by better financial results the year over year improvement in financial results mainly reflected lower net indebtedness and average interest rates the increase in effective tax rate in the first quarter 2019 mainly reflected the changes in deferred taxes produced by the mexican peso s appreciation against the u s dollar which was lower in the first quarter 2019 than in the first quarter 2018 outlook ternium expects ebitda to decrease slightly in the second quarter 2019 compared to the first quarter 2019 as a result of a lower normalizing steel margin partially offset by moderately higher shipments the company will remain focused on maximizing efficiency throughout its production value chain in mexico ternium anticipates realized steel prices will decline further in the second quarter of the year mainly due to the delayed effect of industrial customer s quarterly reset of contract prices which will continue reflecting a protracted steel price downturn between july 2018 and january 2019 overall the mexican industrial market should continue to exhibit steady steel demand in the second quarter of the year coupled with moderate destocking at some automotive service centers the mexican commercial market s performance should remain sluggish due to continued low construction activity which affects the company s shipments in the country in argentina despite a weak economic forecast shipments are expected to sequentially increase during the second quarter 2019 this anticipated increase should result from the gradual recovery of the local steel market and the eventual conclusion of the destocking in the country s steel industry value chain analysis of first quarter 2019 results net gain attributable to ternium s equity owners in the first quarter 2019 was 218 2 million compared to net gain attributable to ternium s equity owners of 338 9 million in the first quarter 2018 including non controlling interest net gain for the first quarter 2019 was 224 9 million compared to net gain of 376 7 million in the first

the financial performance and condition of the company these measures which the company believes are widely used by investors securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the company

our story in 2019 and 2020 will be a very good one on both an absolute and relative basis we are seeing some softness in automotive markets and are doing well overall despite the headwinds our north american segment has done extremely well year to date despite some reduction in overall market volumes the north american economy continues to perform positively and the trade and tariff issues that we still face in our industry have had some negative effect but limited in scope and severity our european segment saw steady sales and operating income year over year during the quarter but there has been softness there in overall volumes and in the volumes of some key customers whether caused by the brexit uncertainty or the uncertain regulatory environment we do see some continuing softness there our rest of the world segment while a very small part of our business has had some major volume challenges some regional and some with the volumes of our customers in the regions being china and brazil resulting in reduced sales and losses for the segment our fluids plant in china and our aluminum brazilian operations in particular have been negatively impacted by these volume headwinds as such we are currently contemplating downsizing these facilities to keep costs in line with sales and ultimately improving our competitiveness in these sometimes difficult markets we are also seeing some supplier stress in the overall market making some assets available i am pleased to report that we recently acquired a small plant in mississippi from variform at a very attractive price along

the modified retrospective approach which involves recognizing transitional adjustments in opening retained earnings if any on the date of initial application without restating comparative prior periods as such 2018 prior year comparatives have not been restated the adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of lease liabilities of 228 6 million and right of use assets of 223 8 million net of accrued liabilities related to the leases of 4 8 million recognized as at january 1 2019 in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet from an earnings perspective while timing differences may exist the new standard results in a decrease in operating rent expense essentially replaced by increases in finance and depreciation expenses as recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations as such the adoption of ifrs 16 did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results and the financial metrics for the quarter ended march 31 2019 outlined above other than adjusted ebitda the adoption of ifrs 16 contributed approximately 7 of the year over year growth in adjusted ebitda due to the recognition of depreciation expense on right of

acceptance by the customer these positive factors were partially offset by lower year over year production volumes on certain light vehicle platforms including the ford escape and jeep wrangler and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 sales for the first quarter of 2019 in the company s europe operating segment increased by 4 7 million or 2 5 to 190 4 million from 185 7 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increase can be attributed to the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 including a 2 0l aluminum engine block for ford and a 9 4 million increase in tooling sales these positive factors were partially offset by lower year over year production volumes on certain jaguar land rover platforms and a 1 3 million negative foreign exchange impact from the translation of euro denominated production sales as compared to the first quarter of 2018 sales for the first quarter of 2019 in the company s rest of the world operating segment decreased by 17 0 million or 42 2 to 23 3 million from 40 4 million in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was due to a lower year over year production volumes on the ford mondeo and cadillac ct6 vehicle platforms in china lower year over year production sales in the company s facility in brazil a 5 4 million decrease in tooling sales and a 1 0 million negative foreign exchange impact from the translation of foreign denominated production sales as compared to the first quarter of 2018 these negative factors were partially offset by the ramp up of new aluminum structural components work for jaguar land rover in china which began to ramp up in the first quarter of 2018 but at significantly lower than expected volumes overall tooling sales increased by 24 7 million or 34 7 to 95 9 million for the first quarter of 2019 from 71 2 million for the first quarter of 2018 gross margin three months ended march 31 2019 to three months ended march 31 2018

of 2019 of 15 4 increased as a percentage of sales by 0 4 as compared to the gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018 of 15 0 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was generally due to productivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities and general sales mix including new and replacement programs that launched and old programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 these positive factors were partially offset by operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain other facilities including upfront costs incurred in preparation of upcoming new programs and related to new business in the process of being launched and an increase in tooling sales which typically earn low margins for the company

later on in the md a under disclosure of outstanding share data adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted by the following operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain other facilities including upfront costs incurred in preparation of upcoming new programs and related to new business in the process of being launched a year over year increase in research and development costs due to increased new product and process research and development activity a year over year increase in sg a expense a year over

net unrealized foreign exchange gain of 2 7 million for the first quarter of 2018 and a higher effective tax rate on adjusted income due generally to the mix of earnings 24 9 for the first quarter of

efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities general sales mix including new and replacement programs that launched and old programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 and lower operating rent expense due to the adoption of ifrs 16 generally replaced by increases in finance and depreciation expenses dividend a cash dividend of 0 045 per share has

prior year agreed to invest approximately 630 million of capital 160 million net to bep across two transactions one in canada and one in india at returns commensurate with our long term targets commissioned a 19 megawatt hydroelectric facility in brazil and advanced an additional 134 megawatts of hydro wind storage and rooftop solar construction projects globally raised over 400 million of proceeds through asset sale initiatives and the issuance of preferred units and ended the quarter with 2 3 billion of available liquidity reduced our ffo payout ratio on an annualized basis to below 90 investments in march 2019 we together with our institutional partners agreed to invest c 750 million c 188 million net to bep in 7 convertible securities of transalta corporation the largest power producer in alberta canada the investment will occur in two tranches c 350 million was funded at initial closing on may 1st and c 400 million will be funded in october 2020 the convertible securities provide us with the option to convert into an interest in transalta s 813 megawatt portfolio of high quality hydroelectric assets in alberta between 2025 and 2028 based on a multiple of 13 times the average annual ebitda over the three years prior to conversion as part of the transaction we also agreed to increase our ownership of transalta s common shares from approximately 5 today to over 9 the transalta investment was the culmination of a multi year dialogue and establishes a strategic relationship with the company to help advance its growth strategy as it transitions to a low carbon energy future in india we have been assessing opportunities over the last number of years but have generally remained patient as valuations remain high today we are seeing compelling opportunities driven by capital constraints in the renewable power sector we are pleased to announce that in april we entered into an agreement to acquire two wind farms totaling 210 megawatts in india for 70 million 18 million net to bep bringing our total portfolio in that country to 510 megawatts these assets are high quality recently constructed with a track record of operating performance and are fully contracted under a long term 25 year power purchase agreement with a credit worthy utility operations during the first quarter we generated ffo of 227 million up from 193 million in the prior year our business continues to benefit from growing resource diversity limited off taker concentration risk and the build out of our development pipeline during the quarter overall generation exceeded long term average by 7 as we have stated for many years we do not manage the business based on under or over performance of generation relative to the long term average and do not factor this into our planning instead our focus remains on diversifying the business which over the long term mitigates exposure to resource volatility regional or market disruptions and potential credit events for example given the breadth of our business the recent events with pg e will have no impact on our business less than 0 1 of exposure furthermore our single largest non government third party customer represents only 3 of generation providing strong downside protection and safeguarding our cash flows during the first quarter our hydroelectric segment contributed 218 million to ffo in north america generation was above the long term average and we ended the quarter with above average reservoir levels in canada and pjm where we have significant seasonal storage flexibility additionally we saw strong results in south america supported by high prices for our energy and ancillary products we continue to make progress on contracting initiatives for our hydroelectric portfolio signing 15 contracts in the quarter for a total of approximately 2 300 gigawatt hours per year our focus in colombia and brazil has been to lengthen the term of our power purchase contracts as power price volatility in these markets provides an opportunity to stabilize future revenues while locking in upside as our contracts are generally at or below market our wind and solar businesses contributed 67 million to ffo during the quarter a 43 increase relative to the prior year as we benefitted from acquisitions and contributions from recently commissioned projects we continue to generate stable revenues from these assets as we benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements our storage facilities and other operations which are not reliant on power prices but rather sell services to the grid contributed 7 million to ffo during the quarter we commissioned a 19 megawatt hydroelectric facility in brazil from our development pipeline during the quarter in addition we continue to build out 134 megawatts of hydroelectric wind solar and storage projects that are currently under construction that are expected to contribute 13 million to ffo once commissioned we are also advancing our global hydro wind solar and distributed generation development pipeline including 636 megawatts of construction ready and advanced stage projects through final permitting and securing a route to market we are also assessing 220 megawatts of repowering projects in new york california and hawaii all markets where renewables play a critical role in providing low cost clean energy balance sheet and liquidity our balance sheet remains strong with 2 3 billion of available liquidity at quarter end we have no material debt maturities over the next four years and our overall debt duration is 10 years we remain well protected from foreign exchange volatility due to our hedging program accordingly an overall 10 move in the currencies of markets we operate in would have an overall 4 impact to our ffo during the quarter we raised 400 million through asset sales and the issuance of preferred units we completed the sale an additional 25 interest in a portfolio of canadian hydroelectric assets we also advanced the sales of our non core portfolios in south africa thailand and malaysia that once

spokane wash may 02 2019 globe newswire avista corp nyse ava today reported net income attributable to avista corp shareholders of 115 8 million or 1 76 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 54 9 million or 0 83 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 our consolidated earnings were below our expectations for the first quarter however we remain on track to meet our guidance for the full year our first quarter 2019 earnings were positively impacted by the receipt of the termination fee from hydro one said scott morris chairman and chief executive officer of avista corp avista utilities had lower earnings due to below normal hydroelectric generation and higher natural gas fuel prices which caused an increase in net power supply costs we still expect to be in a benefit position in our energy recovery mechanism in washington in 2019 in addition we also had higher income taxes during the quarter on april 30 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing the purpose of our general rate case requests is to recover the costs associated with our capital investments to replace infrastructure that has reached the end of its useful life as well as respond to the need for reliability and technology investments required to build an integrated energy services grid ael p and our other businesses each had a good start to the year for the full year of 2019 we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per

and state combined of 23 05 percent b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following an increase in net power supply costs due to lower hydroelectric generation as well as higher purchased power prices and natural gas fuel prices this caused the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington to decrease from a 4 9 million pre tax benefit for the first quarter of 2018 to a 2 5 million pre tax expense for the first quarter of 2019 for the full year of 2019 we expect to be in a benefit position under the erm within the 75 percent customer 25 percent company sharing band the above decreases were partially offset by general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail electric revenue in the first quarter of 2019 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in the first quarter of 2019 d other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 increased as a result of an increase in generation and distribution operating and maintenance costs and employee incentive and benefit costs e merger transaction costs were 19 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2018 the merger transaction costs increased for the first quarter because 2018 costs consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2019 costs included consulting banking fees and legal fees in addition to employee time none of the acquisition costs are being passed through to customers during 2017 and 2018 a portion of the merger transaction costs which reduced income before income taxes were not deductible for tax purposes however now that the transaction has been terminated all the transaction costs are deductible as a result we recognized an additional tax benefit during 2019 of 1 8 million related to transaction costs from prior years which has been reflected in this line item the 19 7 million pre tax transaction costs incurred in 2019 were taxed at our statutory rate of 23 05 percent f depreciation and amortization increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additions to utility plant g interest expense increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additional outstanding debt during 2019 as compared to 2018 as well as an increase in interest rates h as a result of the termination of the proposed merger hydro one paid avista corp a 103 million termination fee in january 2019 the termination fee was used for reimbursing our transaction costs incurred from 2017 to 2019 these costs including income taxes totaled approximately 51 million the balance of the termination fee was used for general corporate purposes and reduced our need for external financing i other for the first quarter of 2019 were decreases to earnings primarily due to an increase in property taxes j our effective tax rate was 20 6 percent for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 16 3 percent for the first quarter of 2018 we expect our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 16 percent to 17 percent k the increase in earnings at our other businesses was primarily because the first quarter of 2018 included expenses associated with a renovation project also there were increased earnings from equity investments in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following table presents avista utilities operating revenues resource

liquidity we have a 400 0 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 as of march 31 2019 we had 220 9 million of available liquidity under this line of credit we also had 25 0 million of available liquidity under ael p s committed line of credit that expires in november 2019 in 2019 we expect to issue approximately 165 million of long term debt and up to 50 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures and other investments avista utilities capital expenditures were 92 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and we expect avista utilities capital expenditures to total about 405 million in 2019 we expect ael p s capital expenditures to total about 9 million in 2019 in addition we expect to invest about 19 million at our other businesses in 2019 this is mainly related to economic development projects in our service territory intended to demonstrate the latest energy and environmental building innovations and house several local college degree programs 2019 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is confirming its 2019 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs we expect to experience regulatory lag during the period 2019 through 2021 on april 30 2019 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter of 2019 we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an annual earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 with a return to our normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate following 2022 the earnings growth rates are based on the mid point of our 2019 earnings guidance as the starting point and exclude the 1 01 per diluted share related to the hydro one transaction these growth rates also assume timely

prior year agreed to invest approximately 630 million of capital 160 million net to bep across two transactions one in canada and one in india at returns commensurate with our long term targets commissioned a 19 megawatt hydroelectric facility in brazil and advanced an additional 134 megawatts of hydro wind storage and rooftop solar construction projects globally raised over 400 million of proceeds through asset sale initiatives and the issuance of preferred units and ended the quarter with 2 3 billion of available liquidity reduced our ffo payout ratio on an annualized basis to below 90 investments in march 2019 we together with our institutional partners agreed to invest c 750 million c 188 million net to bep in 7 convertible securities of transalta corporation the largest power producer in alberta canada the investment will occur in two tranches c 350 million was funded at initial closing on may 1st and c 400 million will be funded in october 2020 the convertible securities provide us with the option to convert into an interest in transalta s 813 megawatt portfolio of high quality hydroelectric assets in alberta between 2025 and 2028 based on a multiple of 13 times the average annual ebitda over the three years prior to conversion as part of the transaction we also agreed to increase our ownership of transalta s common shares from approximately 5 today to over 9 the transalta investment was the culmination of a multi year dialogue and establishes a strategic relationship with the company to help advance its growth strategy as it transitions to a low carbon energy future in india we have been assessing opportunities over the last number of years but have generally remained patient as valuations remain high today we are seeing compelling opportunities driven by capital constraints in the renewable power sector we are pleased to announce that in april we entered into an agreement to acquire two wind farms totaling 210 megawatts in india for 70 million 18 million net to bep bringing our total portfolio in that country to 510 megawatts these assets are high quality recently constructed with a track record of operating performance and are fully contracted under a long term 25 year power purchase agreement with a credit worthy utility operations during the first quarter we generated ffo of 227 million up from 193 million in the prior year our business continues to benefit from growing resource diversity limited off taker concentration risk and the build out of our development pipeline during the quarter overall generation exceeded long term average by 7 as we have stated for many years we do not manage the business based on under or over performance of generation relative to the long term average and do not factor this into our planning instead our focus remains on diversifying the business which over the long term mitigates exposure to resource volatility regional or market disruptions and potential credit events for example given the breadth of our business the recent events with pg e will have no impact on our business less than 0 1 of exposure furthermore our single largest non government third party customer represents only 3 of generation providing strong downside protection and safeguarding our cash flows during the first quarter our hydroelectric segment contributed 218 million to ffo in north america generation was above the long term average and we ended the quarter with above average reservoir levels in canada and pjm where we have significant seasonal storage flexibility additionally we saw strong results in south america supported by high prices for our energy and ancillary products we continue to make progress on contracting initiatives for our hydroelectric portfolio signing 15 contracts in the quarter for a total of approximately 2 300 gigawatt hours per year our focus in colombia and brazil has been to lengthen the term of our power purchase contracts as power price volatility in these markets provides an opportunity to stabilize future revenues while locking in upside as our contracts are generally at or below market our wind and solar businesses contributed 67 million to ffo during the quarter a 43 increase relative to the prior year as we benefitted from acquisitions and contributions from recently commissioned projects we continue to generate stable revenues from these assets as we benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements our storage facilities and other operations which are not reliant on power prices but rather sell services to the grid contributed 7 million to ffo during the quarter we commissioned a 19 megawatt hydroelectric facility in brazil from our development pipeline during the quarter in addition we continue to build out 134 megawatts of hydroelectric wind solar and storage projects that are currently under construction that are expected to contribute 13 million to ffo once commissioned we are also advancing our global hydro wind solar and distributed generation development pipeline including 636 megawatts of construction ready and advanced stage projects through final permitting and securing a route to market we are also assessing 220 megawatts of repowering projects in new york california and hawaii all markets where renewables play a critical role in providing low cost clean energy balance sheet and liquidity our balance sheet remains strong with 2 3 billion of available liquidity at quarter end we have no material debt maturities over the next four years and our overall debt duration is 10 years we remain well protected from foreign exchange volatility due to our hedging program accordingly an overall 10 move in the currencies of markets we operate in would have an overall 4 impact to our ffo during the quarter we raised 400 million through asset sales and the issuance of preferred units we completed the sale an additional 25 interest in a portfolio of canadian hydroelectric assets we also advanced the sales of our non core portfolios in south africa thailand and malaysia that once closed will generate an additional 90 million of total liquidity net to bep distribution declaration the next quarterly distribution in the amount of 0 515 per lp unit is payable on june 28 2019 to

pakistan and the international monetary fund imf have yet to bridge their differences in three major policy areas as the global lender seeks upfront monetary tightening and elimination of the flow of circular debt from the first year of the programme pakistani and imf officials held a first face off plenary meeting on wednesday in which all key policy areas were discussed the pakistani side was led by adviser to the prime minister on finance dr abdul hafeez shaikh the imf delegation was headed by its mission chief ernesto rigo the pakistani delegation briefed the imf team on the current economic situation and reforms that the government had introduced speaking after the meeting the adviser said talks would continue in the coming days the imf staff level team is in the country from april 29 to may 10 with an aim to finalise the three year extended fund facility programme valuing nearly 6 5 billion without an imf umbrella pakistan s external sector position remains extremely fragile the deal with the imf will open doors for borrowings from the world bank the asian development bank and launch of sovereign bonds on his return from washington last month former finance minister asad umar said pakistan and the imf had reached an agreement in principle and the technical details would be finalised during the visit of the global lender s team to the country but finance ministry sources said both sides still had differences over the monetary policy the phasing out of electricity subsidies the upfront taxation measures and the federal government s expenditures the government has so far appeared reluctant to substantially increase the electricity prices and slap taxes worth over rs600 billion apparently an unrealistic demand the successful resolution of these issues along with an agreement on the monetary stance can pave the way for the staff level deal by may 10 the sources said the pakistani authorities had earlier given the impression that the imf had withdrawn from its demand of further increase in the interest rate before the approval of the loan package by its executive board the sources said the issue was yet to be settled as the imf wanted the rate further jacked up the state bank of pakistan has already increased the key discount rate to 10 75 although the finance ministry had reservations on the last two policy rate hikes the pakistani authorities are of the view that the monetary policy should not be seen in the light of short term fluctuation in the inflation index the government is willing to keep the interest rate positive but it did not want to peg it with monthly movements in the core inflation index the sources said they added that previous hikes in the discount rates coupled with the 35 currency devaluation had adversely affected economic growth besides causing a spike in inflation the government s cost of debt servicing has also substantially increased because of the hike in electricity prices another key imf demand is that pakistan should eliminate the flow of circular debt from the first year of the global lender s programme by the end of this fiscal year the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti government will add over rs325 billion to the already pending stock of circular debt a figure that the imf is seeking to be brought to zero by the end of the fiscal year 2019 20 the sources said against the imf demand the government has presented a two year plan to completely eliminate the circular debt starting from july 2019 to june 2021 they added under this plan the flow of the circular debt will come down to slightly over rs200 billion at the end of the next fiscal year and stand at rs93 billion for the fiscal year 2020 21 from july 2021 the circular debt will be completely eliminated the sources said the imf was of the view that if the government could not fully eliminate the circular debt in the first year then it should fully reflect its fiscal implications in the budget however this will squeeze the government s spending space in other areas as the imf will not like to relax the overall ceiling of the budget deficit they added the energy ministry s stance is that the proposal to increase the electricity tariff will be counterproductive the government has launched a campaign against electricity theft and low recovery of bills a substantial increase in electricity tariff may discourage people from complying with the law during the past four months the recovery of electricity bills has improved by an additional rs51 billion the energy ministry has assured the imf that it would facilitate quarterly adjustments in electricity prices but it was not in favour of full cost recovery in one go the ministry has developed a three year plan for targeting the tariff differential subsidies and bringing the tariff to a cost recovery level along with cost cutting and efficiency measures to reach full cost recovery in the electricity sector the gas and electricity tariffs have already been increased to move towards full cost recovery and curtail the build up of circular debt the sources said the tariff for the consumption of up to 200 units per month is planned to be retained the subsidies for consumption exceeding 200 units will be phased out from the second year of the programme the government has also informed the imf that it would recover the cost of servicing for the syndicated term credit finance facility from electricity consumers
spokane wash may 02 2019 globe newswire avista corp nyse ava today reported net income attributable to avista corp shareholders of 115 8 million or 1 76 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 54 9 million or 0 83 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 our consolidated earnings were below our expectations for the first quarter however we remain on track to meet our guidance for the full year our first quarter 2019 earnings were positively impacted by the receipt of the termination fee from hydro one said scott morris chairman and chief executive officer of avista corp avista utilities had lower earnings due to below normal hydroelectric generation and higher natural gas fuel prices which caused an increase in net power supply costs we still expect to be in a benefit position in our energy recovery mechanism in washington in 2019 in addition we also had higher income taxes during the quarter on april 30 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing the purpose of our general rate case requests is to recover the costs associated with our capital investments to replace infrastructure that has reached the end of its useful life as well as respond to the need for reliability and technology investments required to build an integrated energy services grid ael p and our other businesses each had a good start to the year for the full year of 2019 we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs morris said summary results avista corp s results for the first quarter of 2019 as compared

and state combined of 23 05 percent b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following an increase in net power supply costs due to lower hydroelectric generation as well as higher purchased power prices and natural gas fuel prices this caused the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington to decrease from a 4 9 million pre tax benefit for the first quarter of 2018 to a 2 5 million pre tax expense for the first quarter of 2019 for the full year of 2019 we expect to be in a benefit position under the erm within the 75 percent customer 25 percent company sharing band the above decreases were partially offset by general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail electric revenue in the first quarter of 2019 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in the first quarter of 2019 d other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 increased as a result of an increase in generation and distribution operating and maintenance costs and employee incentive and benefit costs e merger transaction costs were 19 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2018 the merger transaction costs increased for the first quarter because 2018 costs consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2019 costs included consulting banking fees and legal fees in addition to employee time none of the acquisition costs are being passed through to customers during 2017 and 2018 a portion of the merger transaction costs which reduced income before income taxes were not deductible for tax purposes however now that the transaction has been terminated all the transaction costs are deductible as a result we recognized an additional tax benefit during 2019 of 1 8 million related to transaction costs from prior years which has been reflected in this line item the 19 7 million pre tax transaction costs incurred in 2019 were taxed at our statutory rate of 23 05 percent f depreciation and amortization increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additions to utility plant g interest expense increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additional outstanding debt during 2019 as compared to 2018 as well as an increase in interest rates h as a result of the termination of the proposed merger hydro one paid avista corp a 103 million termination fee in january 2019 the termination fee was used for reimbursing our transaction costs incurred from 2017 to 2019 these costs including income taxes totaled approximately 51 million the balance of the termination fee was used for general corporate purposes and reduced our need for external financing i other for the first quarter of 2019 were decreases to earnings primarily due to an increase in property taxes j our effective tax rate was 20 6 percent for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 16 3 percent for the first quarter of 2018 we expect our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 16 percent to 17 percent k the increase in earnings at our other businesses was primarily because the first quarter of 2018 included expenses associated with a renovation project also there were increased earnings from equity investments in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following table presents avista utilities operating revenues resource

liquidity we have a 400 0 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 as of march 31 2019 we had 220 9 million of available liquidity under this line of credit we also had 25 0 million of available liquidity under ael p s committed line of credit that expires in november 2019 in 2019 we expect to issue approximately 165 million of long term debt and up to 50 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures and other investments avista utilities capital expenditures were 92 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and we expect avista utilities capital expenditures to total about 405 million in 2019 we expect ael p s capital expenditures to total about 9 million in 2019 in addition we expect to invest about 19 million at our other businesses in 2019 this is mainly related to economic development projects in our service territory intended to demonstrate the latest energy and environmental building innovations and house several local college degree programs 2019 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is confirming its 2019 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs we expect to experience regulatory lag during the period 2019 through 2021 on april 30 2019 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter of 2019 we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an annual earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 with a return to our normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate following 2022 the earnings growth rates are based on the mid point of our 2019 earnings guidance as the starting point and exclude the 1 01 per diluted share related to the hydro one transaction these growth rates also assume timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2019 earnings guidance range encompasses unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2019 guidance range includes regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 105 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 5 percent in 2019 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 2 72 to 2 86 per diluted share for 2019 this includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 75 percent customer 25 percent company sharing band which is expected to add approximately 0 05 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and below normal hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year for 2019 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 09 to 0 13 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year we expect the other businesses to be between a loss of 0 03 and a loss of 0 01 per diluted share which includes costs associated with exploring strategic opportunities our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and

for joining us transitioning from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019 carried a degree of uncertainty due to an environment where our customers were prudently revising capex plans for 2019 resulting from pressure from shareholders to hold capex spending within operating cash flow year over year capex projections by many of our e p operator customers sets up an environment where most analysts are projecting activity declines in the high single to low double digit percentage range in the us land market on our last earnings call we guided that 1q 19 revenue would have a sequential increase in the low to mid single digit range making on modest rebound in canada and some market share gains in the permian our full year 2019 guide was flat year over year to low single digit decline in revenue for 2019 our 1q 19 revenue came in at 785 million up 21 million or 3 sequentially within our guided range for the first quarter 2019 we delivered ebitda excluding other costs of 31 million in the quarter and our gross margins improved 70 basis points year over year sequentially gross margins declined 40 basis points as the competitive environment we expected materialized one of the main contributors to sequential margin reduction is related to slowing us land activity in such an environment profit margins are more contested in addition to the macro us land backdrop commodity process in supply and demand affecting commodities have changed from the previous inflationary environment we had over the last several quarters markets have been under pressure as we got it due to better product availability in the market during this industry pause as we ve noted hot roll coil pricing continues to decline affecting welded pipe and the octg market is weakening leaving more mill capacity on the market to produce line pipe the result is downward pressure on price as the market looks to turn higher cost inventory global rig count averaged 2 262 rigs according to baker hughes sequentially flat and a 2 year over year increase our annualized revenue per rig was 1 4 million for 1q of 2019 us average rig count was down sequentially 2 to 1 046 rigs yet up year over year 8 us drilled but uncompleted wells or ducs ended with 8 500 wells in march and averaged 8 471 for 1q up 6 sequentially ducs present future revenue opportunity for dnow should the wells be completed which should drive tank battery construction and midstream gathering systems wti averaged 55 per barrel for the first quarter trending up throughout the quarter we are maintaining adherence to our four strategic areas of delivering on margin discipline maximizing our core operations leveraging our acquisitions and having a tactical approach to capital allocation with the ongoing successful execution of these strategies we can deliver on the gains our shareholders expect and we made progress in those areas in the first quarter in area of operations we continue to optimize our footprint and inventory to capitalize on market opportunities as we scale to meet market demand where we had a few small location closures in the first quarter and maintain wsa under 140 million all while growing the top line we re maintaining our focus on supporting growth in areas of high activity by allocating resources to support our customers operations as we leverage operational efficiencies with our employees processes and technology since the fourth quarter of 2018 we opened our newest regional distribution center in the permian to more efficiently organize inventory across the area and to help further optimize inventory in the permian the permian rdc investment solidifies our long term commitment to customers in the permian while providing operations with more flexibility on inventory planning order fulfillment strategies for staging and bundling as well as logistics solutions for our customers we continue to focus on opportunities to better tune our inventory across our network to increase inventory turns and reduce our overall inventory investment we further executed our human capital strategy in hot and low activity areas to strengthen our position by prioritizing recruiting and training holding recruiting events relocating key personnel and providing a safe positive work environment based on our core values of accountability doing what it takes caring about our co workers our customers and our communities beyond just providing commodity products we have been successfully delivering more value in the application of products and supply chain solutions that focus on industry applications such as tank battery hookups upgrades on existing batteries pumping solutions for midstream crude water and ngl pipelines produced water disposal gas measurement lacts vapor recovery units and modular fabricated process and production equipment we re meeting the demand for gathering systems and midstream projects comprised of pipe high yield fittings and flanges large diameter valves and actuation closures pump packages and fabricated equipment such as pig launcher and receiver modules we re exploring economical ways to expand capacity where we have choke points both organically and inorganically to grow in these areas we continue to manage product cost changes and inventory mix related to section 232 impacting steel products section 301 impacting chinese manufactured goods and components and dumping cases related to certain imported pipe fittings and flanges through our strong relationships with suppliers cost changes are integrated into our pricing and quoting process when applicable we are deploying technology to enhance our quote turnaround time customer order process fulfillment and delivery mechanisms our cross selling from acquired companies continues to add value the strong collaboration between us energy centers us supply chain services and us process solutions is resulting in pull through sales new customer introductions increased market opportunities and further market penetration as most evident in our us process solutions gains turning to our segments us revenues were 600 million up 21 million or 4 sequentially in line with expectations as the us rebounded from the holidays us energy centers contributed 52 us supply chain services 31 and us process solutions 17 of first quarter 2019 us revenue the permian continues to be the most active in areas of the delaware and midland basins with growth also in the eagle ford bakken and rockies midstream projects were active in the permian eagle ford and northeast and were a large contributor to our sequential top line growth us energy centers revenue was 314 million an increase of 2 sequentially the improved position we highlighted last quarter in the permian contributed to delivering top line growth for our us energy centers all while rig counts declined as we provided a range of valves and maintenance products followed by new tank battery builds and expansion batteries our broad range of products and services combined with our application expertise provided not only pipe valves fittings and flanges but also instrumentation electrical safety and production equipment the delaware basin continues to be a very active area with a number of our customers as we supply core mro and pipe valve and fittings products to drilling contractors oil and gas operators and midstream customers rig count within the delaware grew over the quarter with our core customers showing signs of continued robust activity in south texas we were successful in providing pvf for midstream customers for gathering and pipeline projects as well as processing facilities that have been under construction to help take away capacity from the permian to the gulf coast downstream market in the northeast our midstream launcher and receiver program for a major midstream customer continues to bear fruit as we provide repacked staged and delivery of customized pvf kits which increases our customer supply chain efficiency and streamlines their order process our employees collaboration with multiple parties including fabricators ensure material is forecasted kitted quali documents are validated and order fill rates meet agreed upon predetermined targets the mid continent area saw a sequential rig count decline for the quarter approximating 17 our line pipe business softened during the quarter as we continue to see falling pipe replacement costs and some seasonality weakness we delivered pipe to oil and gas operators for gathering projects and major midstream customers to support their pipeline expansion projects as for us supply chain services revenue was up 2 sequentially activity continued with our main scs energy customers in the permian delaware basin scoop stack eagle ford and bakken place pvf facility revenue was lighter in the quarter with one of our major operators correlated to design modifications made on new built facilities in the bakken poor weather contributed to low activity resulting in limited customer workdays during the quarter us supply chain services operator customers orders were related to steel line pipe valves flowback kits production equipment and electrical products in an effort to continually add value as a supply chain partner we secured orders for water alternating gas or wag units for the permian regarding downstream and industrial activity we executed on project and turnaround business involving pvf mill tool and safety products for major refiners and chemical manufacturing facilities for us process solutions we saw a sequential 11 million improvement of 13 the permian remain the most active region for us process solutions with the bakken rockies and eagle ford area all experiencing increased activity in the quarter our strategy to grow market share for our fabricated process and production equipment business continues as we received orders for a variety of units including but not limited to lacts motor control centers or mccs heater treaters vapor recovery towers and water injection and pipeline pump packages that were shipped to north dakota texas wyoming montana and colorado areas customers range from small to large independent e p operators as well as midstream companies which represented our largest growth customer segments sequentially for us process solutions our strategy to provide engineered pump package solutions targeted to the water management industry continues to be strong for water applications customers range from small oil and gas operators to midstream firms to stand alone water management companies furthermore i am pleased with our market penetration within the midstream pipeline booster market as a result of shipping pump packages for crude ngl and light end fluids movement for gathering lines working with our strategic vendors to plan and provide kitted pump solutions offers a unique value proposition to our midstream customers from pump packages process and production equipment as well as actuated valves from our us process solutions group turning to our canadian operations revenue decreased 2 million or 2 sequentially the market continues to contract due to production curtailment instituted by the alberta government to offset rising crude inventory levels and an attempt to narrow the price gap between western canadian select and wti oil macro challenges remain as takeaway constraints persist while political and economic challenges impact the oil and gas industry and our business in canada canadian rig count averaged 186 a year over year reduction of 87 rigs or 32 well spuds were 2 179 down 566 or 21 with only 132 operators down 47 or 26 year over year to summarize canada for the first quarter and what s normally our strongest quarter of the year we actually saw a sequential revenue decline as we had fewer rigs fewer operators and lower levels of spudding translating to lower dnow revenue finally the international segment reported first quarter revenues of 99 million up 2 million or 2 sequentially international rig count averaged to 1 030 up 2 sequentially and up 6 year over year gains were led by offshore activity in asia the uk and west africa jackup rig load outs for newbuilds continued during the quarter in asia dnow provides many of the oem and mro consumables used during drilling operations of an offshore rig where we also provide an inventory replenishment model from a nearby store base in close proximity to where the rig has been deployed middle east land activity remained steady s we provide pvf and mro consumable products locally to drilling contractors and noc and ioc oil and gas operators our uk maclean electrical group has been successful in securing and shipping electrical products tied to project activity in the middle east and former cis before moving on to discuss the outlook for the second quarter and the rest of 2019 i ll turn the call over to dave to review the financials david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks robert for the first quarter of 2019 we generated 785 million in revenue up 21 million or 3 from the same period in 2018 sequentially revenue also improved 21 million or 3 first quarter 2019 revenues landed in the range we guided to in our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call whereas oil prices then were declining in the fourth quarter beginning october at 75 and ending the year at 45 they now have improved into the low 60 range in the first quarter gross margins were 20 1 down from the 20 5 level we experienced in the fourth quarter but up 70 basis points from 19 4 a year ago the sequential decline was primarily driven by product margin pressure product mix and a resumption of inventory charges which were lower than usual in the fourth quarter of 2018 conversely the uptick in gross margin percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 can be attributed to an improved pricing position this year and more selective pricing on project quotes compared to this period last year we expect gross margins to be choppy in the near term as the market reacts to reduced activity levels and commodity price volatility as we have discussed we believe there is room for gross margin gains over time expanding generally in inflationary conditions when oil and steel pipe inflation occurs and our market resumes in a growth trajectory warehousing selling and administrative expenses or wsa was 135 million unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2018 in the first quarter we made progress resolving a long standing receivables issue with the third party resulting in the 3 million net favorable effect on wsa and operating profit paired with continued cost savings from various initiatives throughout the organization we expect wsa to approximate 140 million or lower per quarter at the activity levels in our guidance and we ll continue to take additional measures and step with changing market conditions in addition we have been systematically analyzing our supply chain footprint namely improving how effectively our network of distribution centers branches customer onsites and stocked trailers work together how cost effective they are how well they support the customer strategies and how adaptable our network is to the nomadic opportunities the industry provides given the commodity price volatility market dynamics and evolving customer requirements this view helps us shape the profile we need to grow the business and mitigate working capital and operating costs further as you know we have been diligent about fine tuning our model to improve the financial performance of the business as such when considering the locations consolidated or closed in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 the revenue generated in those locations approximated 12 million more in 1q 18 than in 1q 19 while we did retain some of this revenue by servicing activity from our locations we were able to move resources to fund growth elsewhere this remains a mantra for dnow grow the business while demand improved operating efficiencies and working capital velocity while many positive things are happening across dnow one area we ve seen notable gains is in our downstream industrial group this group has implemented a high grading regiment by focusing on higher margin opportunities and product lines and meaningfully improving operating efficiencies while turning their working capital even faster all employees of dnow in addition to our shareholders have benefited from the focus and hard work of this team operating profit was 23 million or 2 9 of revenue an improvement of 16 million year over year net income for the first quarter was 18 million or 0 16 per diluted share an improvement of 0 14 when compared to the corresponding period of 2018 on a non gaap basis ebidta excluding other costs was 31 million or 3 9 of revenue for the first quarter of 2019 an improvement of 15 million versus the first quarter of 2018 net income excluding other costs was 13 million or 0 12 per diluted share other costs after tax for the quarter included the benefits of approximately 5 million from changes in our valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets offset by less than 1 million in severance expenses after tax in the period our effective tax rate as reported for gaap purposes was 6 5 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 24 1 a year ago the change in the effective tax rate when compared to the corresponding period in 2018 was primarily driven by increases in pre tax income in 2019 cash totaled 87 million in march 31 with 76 million located outside the us approximately 60 of which is in canada and the uk historically it s been our practice and intention to reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in light of the significant changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act we previously discussed we are no longer permanently reinvested with regard to our pre 2018 canada and uk earnings we now are able to repatriate excess cash from both canada and the uk to the us providing additional treasury flexibility including repayment of amounts borrowed under our credit facility during the first quarter of 2019 we repatriated 20 million from our canadian operations moving to our segments us revenues were 600 million a 7 improvement from the first quarter of last year on an increase in us rig activity canadian revenues were 86 million down 16 year over year going up in negative impact of foreign exchange in canada the revenue decline would have been 11 amid a 32 decline in canadian rig count and internationally revenues were 99 million in the first quarter of 2019 essentially flat with a year ago after excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange international revenue would have increased 3 from 1q 18 to 1q 19 moving on to operating profit the us generated operating profit of 19 million or 3 2 of revenue an improvement of 16 million when compared to the corresponding period of 2018 primarily due to revenue increases and improved pricing canada operating profit was 2 million or down 2 million when compared to the corresponding period of 2018 as a result of the revenue decline mentioned earlier international operating profit was 2 million or up 2 million when compared to 1q 18 driven by reduced bad debt charges turning to the balance sheet cash totaled 87 million at march 31 and we ended the quarter with 124 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility and a net debt position of 37 million when considering total company cash at march 31 2019 our total liquidity from our credit facility availability plus cash on hand was 531 million our debt to capital ratio was 9 at march 31 or 3 when considered on a net debt basis working capital excluding cash as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was of 2019 was 22 accounts receivable were 513 million at the end of the first quarter up 31 million sequentially on higher sales yielding 60 day dsos first quarter inventory levels were 634 million and inventory turn rates remained steady at 4 0 turns accounts payable were 339 million at the end of the first quarter with days payable outstanding at 49 days net cash used in operating activities was 20 million for the first quarter with negligible capital expenditures this quarter we adopted fasb s new standard for accounting for leases which requires us to move operating leases onto the balance sheet you will see these added assets and liabilities included in our financial statements in the quarter with the impact of adopting this standard on our income statement and cash flow being immaterial we are a working capital intensive business our employees are focused on providing value added products and supply chain solutions by outdelivering and outsourcing the competition while finding ways to meaningfully speed up collections and reduce purchase quantities and safety stock values and aspirations enabled in the static atmosphere so that we can generate higher levels of free cash flow in 2019 and now i ll turn the call back to robert robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks dave let s wrap up with the outlook for the second quarter and the rest of 2019 looking forward in the us wti is trending above its 4q 18 average as us rig count has declined of its december peak us completions have risen from december while the average duc inventory continues to build the most recent report from the eia showed a modest net duc reduction in march even if rig counts decline modestly or remain flattish and if customer budgets shift more toward completions to draw down more on duc inventory this could benefit our us process solutions business for modular rotating production measurement and process equipment this would also benefit our us supply chain services and us energy centers demand for pipe valves and fittings especially as it applies to midstream projects that would be required to get oil gas and water to their final destinations our outlook for the us energy centers remains positive with high activity areas such as the permian eagle ford rockies and bakken leading softer areas such as the mid continent and northeast two of our larger us supply chain services operator customers announced they plan to reduce capex spend approximately 10 this year one stated by the midpoint of 2019 and the other on a year over year basis this will put downward pressure on our us supply chain services revenue for the remainder of the year in canada where political turmoil and takeaway issues persist for which there aren t any solutions in sight the rest of 2019 will be challenging and we expect declines there canada will experience break up as the freeze thaw cycle has historically reduced our canadian revenues by approximately 25 sequentially alberta s recent election results and investment in transportation by rail provide some optimism for the rest of the year however we are cautious about our canadian operations due to all of the uncertainties looking ahead internationally we are eager to see more jack up and floater tenders materializing continue to increase in offshore activity in europe brazil and mexico an uptick in land based activity in australia and budgetary quoting activity tied to some lng projects beyond this we have some bright spots with a specific offshore drilling contractor in asia and other projects in the middle east which could enable growth in our international business recent and planned fid approvals in offshore rig contract announcements indicate that worldwide offshore markets are poised for long term recovery and that could produce more than just marginal top line improvements for our international segment in 2020 and beyond as customers work through inventories and move from exploratory to development activities given these scenarios and recognizing the opaque view we have into customers second half 2019 budgetary plans we reaffirm our guidance for the full year to be flat revenues to a low single digit decline and expect 2q 19 revenue to be flat to low single digit decline from 1q 19 we will continue to focus on maximizing gross margins in a choppy but stabilizing price environment we will work to improve our working capital terms and generate positive free cash flow before i move on to recognize one of our dedicated employees i d like to summarize the progress we made in the execution of our strategy we continue to focus on margin discipline identifying opportunities for enhancement in areas related to our quotation process as well as pricing improving our operational efficiencies optimizing our inventory and our sourcing strategy in responses to import tariffs on steel products and leveraging our previous acquisitions through enhanced cross selling of products in bundled product and service offerings we re adjusting our footprint in our supply chain focusing on our central and regional distribution centers inventory strategy optimizing our human capital leveraging technology to enhance our replenishment settings and partnering with our preferred suppliers to grow market share we approach to capital allocation with discipline by leveraging our inventory investment managing our working capital as a percent of sales with an increase in revenue and maintaining a healthy balance sheet which provides optionality in the event that one of the many companies we d like to add to our differentiated product and service offerings becomes viable with the further successful execution of our strategy we expect continued improvement toward generating free cash flow paying down our already low level of debt and creating greater shareholder value with that let me recognize one of our employees whose daily hard work and dedication enable us to deliver on our promises 44 years ago ed merritt started his career as a warehouseman for the oilwell division of us steel in houston texas in less than a year ed was promoted to storeman and in 1981 ed moved to the purchasing area as a buyer associate followed by move to the front lines as a sales service representative in 1987 after spending several years in sales leadership roles in 1998 ed became an mro coordinator and eventually moved into customer contracts for the distribution services group at national oilwell today ed works as a pricing coordinator where he works closely with sales operations and material sourcing to help drive value for our customers one of ed s claims to fame within close circles of our drilling customer community was winning a branding competition for our customer vendor managed inventory solution for land based rigs also our drilling contractor customers and employees know it today as rig pack over the span of 44 years it would be natural to have a few nicknames thrown at you to see what it sticks for ed two words rise to the top as his co workers colleagues and customers refer to him as steady eddie a nickname that captures ed s pride in his work his commitment and attention to detail ed has had a lifelong passion for horticulture and tends to his own orchard at his home in magnolia just north of houston if you re looking to win a contest or find yourself in a chair wanting to be a millionaire and need to phone a friend who can name any tree plant or flower give steady eddie a call ed thanks for your 44 years of service your customer focus and for doing it the right way now let me turn the call over to richard to start taking your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from david manthey from baird please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey david david manthey robert w baird analyst hey good morning robert and dave robert r workman president and chief executive officer hi david david manthey robert w baird analyst hey dave quick question for you last quarter you had some bad debt recoveries that offset wsa and you said that it would have been 140 million plus if not for those and this quarter you have these lower bad debt charges which i assume are lower accruals to a reserve account the question is is that a one time adjustment or should we expect to sustainably lower accrual there and i guess bottom line is 135 million more representatives going forward or are the 140 million level david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer so in answering your first question we had a 3 million net gain with the third party which is something we ve been working on for probably six years so that benefit you won t see that in future quarters so while we posted wsa at 135 million it s easily 138 million we are seeing more efficiencies lower medical costs this year in the business so we re hoping to bring that number down you know i talked about in my comments we expect wsa to be 140 million or lower right now it s looking like like something in that 138 million 140 million range and we d like to leave a little cushion there in case there in case things percolate and things might get stronger but that s kind of where we re at david manthey robert w baird analyst okay so the 4 million is more a representation of a something that you recaptured as opposed to a sustainably lower accrual based on better experience david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer exactly dave david manthey robert w baird analyst all right thank you david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator and thank you our next question from the line comes from james west from evercore isi please go ahead james west evercore isi analyst good morning guys robert r workman president and chief executive officer good morning james west evercore isi analyst so robert i think the part of your business the offshore part of your business has been well is it bluntly decimated during the downturn here i believe it went from a and these are rough ballpark numbers probably a 250 million a year business to maybe 75 million at the bottom but with the offshore rigs going back to work now i would think that they need to restock that they probably are understocked on equipment spares etc i would think there would be a pretty big opportunity for you guys how do you see that unfold i know you just did a big whirlwind tour and met with many of the offshore operators during that tour so what are they saying and how do you see that opportunity going forward robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so the number you suggested as far as our peak was a full year number and it s dropped off quite considerably through all those rig stockings and everything s going so the reason i don t expect much recovery in that market for us until 2020 ish is because as you know there s about 30 or 40 more at least offshore rigs to be scrapped and they will scrap them as they re putting other rigs to work you know how that works and so they will put that inventory to shore base and they ll start feeding the rigs that are either getting constructed or out there working so for us it s such a huge lag before it affects us especially when we just went through an offshore decline like the one that s never happened before like the one we just went through where there s so much spare inventory out there they ll be burning through their own capital for quite some time so while it will be while it will grow i think our offshore revenue with both oil and gas companies and drillers bottomed in 2q of last year it s improving modestly and it sometimes it s double digit growth but don t forget it s coming off of a really low base james west evercore isi analyst okay okay fair enough and then as you think about the us land market this year even the independents are going to be holding the line within budget which is down a little bit year over year privates likely to respond to the oil price move that we ve had and then you have these two major oil companies announced very ambitious plans and so how does your customer mix stack up against that planning cycle and that budget cycle and do you have could you be conservative i guess in your kind of forecasting for us land it s in fact the major oil companies do what said they re going to do robert r workman president and chief executive officer while the difference between the major oil companies and what i d say the medium to small independents is the major oil companies typically partner pretty strongly with a supply chain provider and some of those majors are some of our largest customers so it could benefit us the lot major is the one that goes to work the part that gives me some concern is our biggest customers our supply chain oil and gas companies and most of those people listen to their earnings call so far this season are toeing the line on their budgets i mean one of them reported earlier this week and he must have said 10 times on the call we are living with our cash flow we re living with our cash flow our capex budget won t go up i don t care where oil goes we re not going to increase our capex budget so there s so many dynamics involved in that that it s really hard at this point to figure out because even some of our big customers that have reported so far have announced they overspent budgets in 1q and then said but we won t overspend this year which leads me to believe that their spend for the next several quarters would be lower than 1q so if you ve got the answer to what our customers are going to spend in the second half of this year i ve got a plane ticket for you to come and entertain us james west evercore isi analyst great all right great thanks guys robert r workman president and chief executive officer no problem david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question from the line comes from marc bianchi from cowen please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hi marc marc bianchi cowen and company analyst hey good morning thank you i guess i m curious to talk a little bit more about the gross margin commentary that you have here you guys have been saying for a few quarters choppy and it has this quarter i m just curious what do you think is the range when you say choppy as we look out over the next couple of quarters and how do you see this octg weakness that you alluded to kind of impacting that as we roll through the next couple david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer okay so we ve talked about gross margins declining for about three quarters now and they held strong through the end of the fourth quarter and had record gross margins of 20 5 so this was the decline we had anticipated for some time but somehow we were able to maintain growth in gross margin several quarters in a row i think we had four quarters in a row over 20 what that range is i don t think we re really sure i mean i think with the 20 1 this quarter it could it s going to vary in these coming quarters but we don t expect major drops in gross margin i think it feels like pricing may have stabilized that s going to depend on what happens in the market if we see things slowing down there will be downward pressure on gross margins if things start to if we start to percolate in the second half we ll see some lift there that s generally kind of how it s going to behave but getting specific about the number it s really hard to tell robert r workman president and chief executive officer and regarding the question you asked about octg we don t really distribute octg but when the mills are rolling still they prefer to make octg over everything else because that s where they make most of their profits so whenever they re really busy making tubing and casing it s really hard to get a slot in the plant for us to get line pipe replenishment orders and they would charge they would charge a premium for that pipe because we are convincing them to stop rolling where they make most of their profit when it slows down and the octg is not filling up the mill they may they re more open to roll in line pipe and they re also more open to cutting better pricing arrangements with their suppliers because they need the volume so that s really how the octg affects all of our line pipe marc bianchi cowen and company analyst so robert to clarify on that your point is that the if octg prices are down there becomes more capacity for line pipe which could perhaps help your gross margin is that really the point you guys are trying to make here robert r workman president and chief executive officer no it s what it does is it creates a deflationary period for line pipe our moving average costs in our system for a line pipe would be higher than what the replacement cost is marc bianchi cowen and company analyst yes okay and then just to and really a follow up you guys have been focused on the working capital line down here and really executing on that as best you can we noticed in the proxy you guys increased the weighting of that metric in the annual comp which i think investors will applaud but could you kind of talk about what the targets are there and how you see that unfolding over the balance of the year david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer okay so working capital right now is 22 we ve had that a bit lower than that we want to go lower aspirationally we ve talked about this we d like to get down to 20 now we re in a period where customers are trying to live within budget everyone s trying to maximize cash retention so our dso suffered a little bit in the quarter customers are holding on to cash the real opportunity in addition to working closer with our customers get paid faster is to turn our inventory better we re a literally encouraged by although we had a use of cash in the first quarter of 20 million it s better than the use of cash last year which was 31 million in the first quarter so we want the kind of quarters to behave similarly in 2019 like it did in 18 and we believe we can turn in our working capital faster and get to more free cash flow in 2019 than 2018 but that s kind of our target and that s what we re shooting for we re in a kind of a sideways environment and it s harder to get them in this space marc bianchi cowen and company analyst got it thank you very much robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks marc operator thank you our next question from the line comes from steve barger from keybanc capital markets please go ahead steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys robert r workman president and chief executive officer morning steve david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer hi steve steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst so i hear you on customers wanting to stay within budget or cash flow but don t you view that as an opportunity to some degree as a lot of your offerings are focused on lowering costs or are just making operations more efficient and how have you pushed the company to respond to the environment robert r workman president and chief executive officer the answer the long answer to your first question is yes the answer to your second question is that you re seeing some of that materialize in our business right now so the two groups that would mainly be able to impact that for customers would be either the process group or the splotching group and splotching group you d basically you have to win a customer and that would be a big event it wouldn t be just incremental the process group is growing for that reason so that s one of the big drivers because we can start pre module arising the entire tank battery while the drilling is going on and so while the drilling is going on and then the frac job is going on we actually could have finished the entire tank battery and then it s all modular and so when the frac crew leaves the well site we can show up with our stuff our kit drop it down it takes minimal time to plug all the stuff together so where a normal tank battery might take 45 to 60 or longer days to visit how many wells are on the pad we can have all of our modules onsite plumed in and producing and cleaning gas oil and water and measuring it and put it in pipelines in three days five days seven days so it s cheaper for the customer because believe it or not the modules that are made in our asme shops and all of our iso shops are high quality the net net cost is lower just straight up what it cost to fabricate it because you don t have a bunch of crews on site with torches and welders and grinders and customers get cash flow quicker because instead of waiting you know 60 to 90 days to get cash flow they get cash flow in short order so that is one of the reasons why we re selling this skid right now to customers who have typically not been our customers because they see the value steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst yes i mean and we ve talked about this before it seems like that solution just should sell itself so what is the pushback if any that you get when you re out offering that to new customers robert r workman president and chief executive officer it s something that most customers haven t experienced before in fact most customers say to us they re like i didn t even know you could do this stuff so we have to sell them on that then you got to get them into the shops then you have to send your quality people into go through our shops and make sure we meet their quality standards but literally most customers didn t know it existed and that was usually the pushback that we got but now right now we re seeing kind of an acceleration of that our biggest issue right now is if you think about these solutions you might have one shop that s fabricating all the skids and then nose feed other shops like the skid shop will feed the lact unit shop it will feed the oil and gas water separator shop it ll feed the multiplex water injection pump package shop so everybody s waiting on their skids to go to shop so they can finish the work another one of our shops that feeds all the other shops is our vessel shop and that s where we make the asme vessels that are used for all sorts of stuff all across they re on the lact units they re on the water injector pump packages they are on the gas part of the gas oil water seperators or the heater treaters all that stuff is waiting on a vessel to come to their shops so they can complete their package that s my choke point right now so that s what i mentioned on the call where we re trying to find inorganic or organic ways to solve that choke point quickly steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst and are you making progress on that front have you found a way to open up some capacity there robert r workman president and chief executive officer i think so yes i believe we have a solution that it will happen in short order steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst and just holding the product pricing conversation constant if you re successful in selling these value added solutions isn t that positive for gross margin over time in itself robert r workman president and chief executive officer it is there s no question about that it would be positive for gross margin over time the one thing that works against us is the huge behemoth that s called the energy centers it takes a lot of positive to move that ship upward steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst right right and i think i missed this but you ve made some comments about one specific downstream team that was really outperforming on inventory turns or margin could any more detail on that and is that something whatever they re doing that you can spread across the platform david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i do think we re doing that across the platform but the leadership there has been particularly focused on improving their business in a meaningful way and we ve seen real positive results there that stuff s happening across the organization but when we looked at year over year most improved that was one of the areas where that happened steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst okay and just one last one for me alberta announced their rail car deal in late february i think they expect to start shipments in july do the customers up there believe that s happening at that pace and what s the real benefit to you when those trains start transporting oil robert r workman president and chief executive officer well the issue with canada went from an operator perspective of oil and gas company perspective is they just need to know that something is going to solve the problem so you know even if somebody announce that ok if d c agreed to alberta yes you can build that pipeline to go to our coast even if that pipeline would take a year and half to two years to build just knowing it s going to get done would spur activity so if there s evidence that shows up that the rail solution is actually going to solve some of the problem i think you would see increased activity but it s but don t forget shipping the oil by rail is a lot more expensive than shipping it by pipeline so the differential between what the oil and gas operator earns after paying to get that product all the way to the gulf coast is still not inspiring it s just a lot better than what we are today steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst right still better than being stranded robert r workman president and chief executive officer exactly steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst got it thanks for the time robert r workman president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you our next question online comes from vebs vaishnav from howard weil please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hi vebs vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst hey good morning how you doing robert r workman president and chief executive officer good vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst i guess i just want to make sure i heard correctly the response to i think marc s question about gross margins did dave mean gross margins are going to be down sequentially or i just didn t want to put words in your mouth i want to make sure i got it correctly though david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer no i don t know that to be the case what i said is we had said for some time we expected we saw our gross margins grow quarter after quarter we saw records in the fourth quarter we expected declines few quarters ago and they occurred in the first quarter what happens from here we re not sure robert r workman president and chief executive officer and vebs the reason why it s hard to forecast that is we re not dealing with some simple way to forecast margins we did millions and millions and millions of transactions like a left and right and so all of that has to settle out so we can see where the margins are headed so it s a really difficult thing to predict david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i don t think the variability is going to be wide but it s going to vary and we might so i ll just leave it at there i think it s going to be a little choppy as we ve been forecasting robert r workman president and chief executive officer i mean if it was down a little bit in this quarter or flat or up a little bit none of those would surprise me vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst got it okay just year over year if i think about like international piece of the business everybody has been talking about mid to high single digit international growth is that a good ballpark to think about overall 2019 robert r workman president and chief executive officer no not for us so if you think about the process you go through when international activity picks up so once an oil and gas company agrees that they re going to hire drill ship and they re going to go out and drill some exploratory wells and then to determine later if we re going to go to development the people that get that revenue first are the drillers and the people that build the subsea equipment and things of that nature it doesn t materialize in my p l until that development work is done yes i ll say the rigs and stuff but what i really need is to go and development when the oil and gas company and there s more than one rig out there start buying a product from us mro products and things of that nature pipe valves and fittings and so that s why i ve said i think i ve been saying three years in a row i didn t expect a material improvement in our international segment until 2020 or beyond vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst okay and just thinking about canada obviously down 16 year over year but there was some fx related issues is 10 to 15 down year over year canada a good ballpark david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer yes probably is i mean we were down 11 in the first quarter if you take out the fx effect so in us dollars it could be in that range vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst okay and just last question for me on tank battery i think like you guys had announced like a one kit full kit ordered last quarter just any uptake any more orders for the full tank battery robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so that particular customer was the first one that gave us a shot at delivering what i just reviewed earlier with james west in his question or not james with the others barger on this question so we delivered that complete turnkey battery they wanted to test us they really liked it and they ve ordered several more since then so i m hoping as other customers find out that this is working for this particular customer that it ll begin to become a more and more accepted solution as opposed to what we ve done it for last 50 years vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst all right that s very helpful thank you for taking my questions robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks vebs operator our next question on line comes from nathan jones from stifel please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey nathan adam farley stifel analyst good morning this is adam farley on for nathan robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey is he down in australia vacationing adam farley stifel analyst it s a busy morning for us hey just turning back to us process solutions you guys called out pretty strong deliveries of produced water packages and some of the future drivers in this like midstream water space so i was wondering maybe you could like size that opportunity or at least provide some color on a high level does midstream water gaining more importance from an e p capital spend robert r workman president and chief executive officer well it is and it s not just the e p folks there are some midstream companies that are in and some pure water companies now the cost of pump packages we sell into that market are generally some of the lower revenue packages because they re just ansi centrifugal pumps generally what s one of the exciting piece is we ve already got some orders lately from some large midstream companies is once you get all that water to one spot which uses the small lower cost packages once you ve treated this water you either have to recycle it which still uses more of these low cost pump packages or you got to reinject it back down in the formation and that s where the big pump packages come in so we were successful last quarter and getting a nice order and for a large midstream company that will take i don t know five six quarters to deliver the whole thing so it s so pretty positive stuff happening in that space in fact the supplier of this big high pressure expensive pumps is one of our partners and they actually mentioned of the order on their earnings call adam farley stifel analyst that s good to hear and then just turning to m a maybe just give an update on the space valuations where you guys are at how is your pipeline what geographies any color there would be great robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so it s now moved from a seller s market to a buyer s market obviously it s that s why almost all of our deals are usually done in a questionable period of market activity and the inbounds are definitely higher than they were the last 18 months and we ve always got deals that we re looking at that s in our that we re constantly negotiating but we just haven t closed any because we re not willing to we re trying to be conservative with how we value these businesses so we re just we never could get up with a bid at spread things look a little bit better right now so we hope something will translate into success in that arena and the good news is we have a super clean balance sheet so we won t have any concerns around leverage or anything like that adam farley stifel analyst and is that are there certain geographies that you re looking at or maybe add something to like a bolt on onto us process solutions or any ideas there robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so our stated strategy around the m a is for anything that we need to do in canada or the us for our energy center business or our us supply chain services business is going to be organic generally unless some deal comes along that we just can t turn down so they can have access to the balance sheet as they come up with great ways to grow their business organically and we will fund that for them if we do anything else in the us it would more than likely be us process solutions and then outside of the us and canada we re kind of open to anything that we do this core whether it s process equipment supply chain investment or in the energy center brands because we re now in some 20 some odd countries that have all their own corporate offices because you have to have them in all these countries so you have all this overhead and so if you can acquire companies that are part of our core service and product offering and tuck them up under that corporate office you can get some pretty nice flow throughs on that stuff so generally that s kind of our planned approach to capital allocation as it applies to acquisitions adam farley stifel analyst all right great thank you robert r workman president and chief executive officer you re welcome david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from sean meakim from jpmorgan robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey sean sean meakim jpmorgan analyst good morning david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning sean meakim jpmorgan analyst so i was hoping we could get some more detail around the midstream it seems like it s becoming a little more prominent in your messaging to the market to what extent did that did some of your working capital build relate to what s going to be probably a pretty busy construction season in 2q and 3q and then long term how do you think about and i recognize that and we ve talked about in the past and to some degree you may not as explicitly distinguish up versus midstream but how do we think about the long term potential of that end market in terms of projects the next couple of years versus long term maintenance and more steady work robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so we ve always been in the market obviously but what we ve experienced as of late which was part of the original plan is we now have access to things that we didn t before that are part of the entire project so for example i m talking about our process solutions group we never had lact units before that s what measure oil when it goes into pipeline we never had the gas measurement systems we never had the vapor recovery units all these stuff that a midstream customer were used to go to us or our competitors to get all the pipe valves and fittings then they would go to another supplier to get all the equipment that goes in like pig launcher receivers and things like that now if we can get upfront with the actual equipment that they re going to use on these pipelines we can typically cross sell all of the material that s needed to construct or put this material into the pipeline so we re seeing a lot of success on cross selling between us supply chain services and us energy centers by them to coordinate with our us process group to bring in a bigger package and offering the end user a better economic opportunity to bundle the whole thing so that s why we re seeing some success in our midstream market greater than normal and that also includes the fact that when we got process solutions before we didn t have the ability to do valve modification and things like that we had to outsource that work now we re doing all that in house so we re getting nice valve and valve actuation orders because we have the ability to turn down a ring joint to erase space or whatever as opposed to waiting on valve deliveries of 38 and 40 and 45 weeks so all that stuff coupled together and the teams working together is what s kind of spurred this nice growth for our midstream customers and literally we have all sorts of businesses we got all sorts of markets whether that s downstream or midstream or upstream or artificial lift or electrical or whatever i really expected 1q to be down where you guys forecasted because we had a decline in completions in 4q and there s a lag and so i expected the completion decline in 4q to translate into revenue declines in 1q fully expected it what happened is that actually happened revenue tied to completions went down our midstream growth offset it sean meakim jpmorgan analyst very interesting yes makes a lot of sense and i guess it d be good to get an update in terms of where we are on your inventory you ve had tariffs coming in last year we had some inflation running through the system at various points that was a net benefit for the distributors so where do we stand today in terms of where your inventory stands versus where spot is across pipe is another kind of key sensitive product lines it d be great to get a sense of where we stand on that and the look forward david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer well what i would say in terms of inventory sean is obviously the period of strong inflation as we went through a period of deflation for a couple of years and then finally we got a nice pump for several quarters mostly driven by steel punctuated by pipe that period is over we re starting to see some pullback in pricing on welded pipe in particular and seamless pipe otherwise where replacement cost is getting close to our inventory costs and in some cases lower so that s kind of leading the downward movement in margins for us in the first quarter so we re trying to manage our inventory to mitigate the effects of that change in pipe costs but i think that ll stabilize once we burn off that inventory sean meakim jpmorgan analyst got it okay thank you for that appreciate it robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks sean david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our time for the question and answer session let me now turn the call

of 18 these strong results were supported by our execution on operating and growth initiatives brookfield renewable first quarter highlights generated ffo per unit of 0 73 an 18 increase over the prior year agreed to invest approximately 630 million of capital 160 million net to bep across two transactions one in canada and one in india at returns commensurate with our long term targets commissioned a 19 megawatt hydroelectric facility in brazil and advanced an additional 134 megawatts of hydro wind storage and rooftop solar construction projects globally raised over 400 million of proceeds through asset sale initiatives and the issuance of preferred units and ended the quarter with 2 3 billion of available liquidity reduced our ffo payout ratio on an annualized basis to below 90 investments in march 2019 we together with our institutional partners agreed to invest c 750 million c 188 million net to bep in 7 convertible securities of transalta corporation the largest power producer in alberta canada the investment will occur in two tranches c 350 million was funded at initial closing on may 1st and c 400 million will be funded in october 2020 the convertible securities provide us with the option to convert into an interest in transalta s 813 megawatt portfolio of high quality hydroelectric assets in alberta between 2025 and 2028 based on a multiple of 13 times the average annual ebitda over the three years prior to conversion as part of the transaction we also agreed to increase our ownership of transalta s common shares from approximately 5 today to over 9 the transalta investment was the culmination of a multi year dialogue and establishes a strategic relationship with the company to help advance its growth strategy as it transitions to a low carbon energy future in india we have been assessing opportunities over the last number of years but have generally remained patient as valuations remain high today we are seeing compelling opportunities driven by capital constraints in the renewable power sector we are pleased to announce that in april we entered into an agreement to acquire two wind farms totaling 210 megawatts in india for 70 million 18 million net to bep bringing our total portfolio in that country to 510 megawatts these assets are high quality recently constructed with a track record of operating performance and are fully contracted under a long term 25 year power purchase agreement with a credit worthy utility operations during the first quarter we generated ffo of 227 million up from 193 million in the prior year our business continues to benefit from growing resource diversity limited off taker concentration risk and the build out of our development pipeline during the quarter overall generation exceeded long term average by 7 as we have stated for many years we do not manage the business based on under or over performance of generation relative to the long term average and do not factor this into our planning instead our focus remains on diversifying the business which over the long term mitigates exposure to resource volatility regional or market disruptions and potential credit events for example given the breadth of our business the recent events with pg e will have no impact on our business less than 0 1 of exposure furthermore our single largest non government third party customer represents only 3 of generation providing strong downside protection and safeguarding our cash flows during the first quarter our hydroelectric segment contributed 218 million to ffo in north america generation was above the long term average and we ended the quarter with above average reservoir levels in canada and pjm where we have significant seasonal storage flexibility additionally we saw strong results in south america supported by high prices for our energy and ancillary products we continue to make progress on contracting initiatives for our hydroelectric portfolio signing 15 contracts in the quarter for a total of approximately 2 300 gigawatt hours per year our focus in colombia and brazil has been to lengthen the term of our power purchase contracts as power price volatility in these markets provides an opportunity to stabilize future revenues while locking in upside as our contracts are generally at or below market our wind and solar businesses contributed 67 million to ffo during the quarter a 43 increase relative to the prior year as we benefitted from acquisitions and contributions from recently commissioned projects we continue to generate stable revenues from these assets as we benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements our storage facilities and other operations which are not reliant on power prices but rather sell services to the grid contributed 7 million to ffo during the quarter we commissioned a 19 megawatt hydroelectric facility in brazil from our development pipeline during the quarter in addition we continue to build out 134 megawatts of hydroelectric wind solar and storage projects that are currently under construction that are expected to contribute 13 million to ffo once commissioned we are also advancing our global hydro wind solar and distributed generation development pipeline including 636 megawatts of construction ready and advanced stage projects through final permitting and securing a route to market we are also assessing 220 megawatts of repowering projects in new york california and hawaii all markets where renewables play a critical role in providing low cost clean energy balance sheet and liquidity our balance sheet remains strong with 2 3 billion of available liquidity at quarter end we have no material debt maturities over the next four years and our overall debt duration is 10 years we remain well protected from foreign exchange volatility due to our hedging program accordingly an overall 10 move in the currencies of markets we operate in would have an overall 4 impact to our ffo during the quarter we raised 400 million through asset sales and the issuance of preferred units we completed the sale an additional 25 interest in a portfolio of canadian hydroelectric assets we also advanced the sales of our non core portfolios in south africa thailand and malaysia that once closed will generate an additional 90 million of total liquidity net to bep distribution declaration the next quarterly distribution in the amount of 0 515 per lp unit is payable on june 28 2019 to

percent with growth in asia pacific and emea and price was flat with the year ago period currency decreased sales by 3 percent consumer solutions sales were flat with the year ago period as gains in volume and local price were offset by currency headwinds in emea and asia pacific the business reported local price and volume increases in all regions for its differentiated silicones products these gains were partially offset by year over year price declines in siloxanes intermediates coatings performance monomers reported a sales decline on lower volume local price and currency in part due to shedding of lower margin business and weather related delays to seasonal demand in the u s canada and emea regions operating ebitda was 481 million down 18 percent from operating ebitda of 586 million in the year ago period primarily due to lower prices for siloxanes and shipping restrictions from a performance monomers facility in deer park texas due to a fire at a nearby third party storage and

over year isocyanates pricing which were partially offset by higher volumes in all regions industrial solutions reported lower sales in all regions driven by lower local price and currency headwinds in most regions the business grew volume driven by gains in emea and u s canada for industrial and oil and gas applications as well as on strong demand for de icing fluids lubricants and fuels equity affiliate losses for the segment were 48 million compared with equity affiliate income of 149 million in the year ago period the year over year decline was driven by increased equity affiliate losses from the sadara joint venture driven by margin compression in isocyanates products as well as lower margins for meg produced by the kuwait joint ventures operating ebitda was 448 million down 31 percent from operating ebitda of 654 million in the year ago period the decline in earnings was primarily due to lower equity affiliate income as well as margin compression in isocyanates products

co products currency decreased sales 2 percent the packaging and specialty plastics business grew volume on higher demand in asia pacific and emea supported by new capacity adds end market growth was led by industrial consumer packaging and flexible food specialty packaging hydrocarbons energy volume declined primarily due to increased ethylene integration from the startup of new downstream assets and higher ethane feedstock usage which led to reduced co product production equity affiliate income was 38 million compared with 59 million in the year ago period the decline was driven by lower earnings from the kuwait joint ventures due to lower polyethylene pricing and increased turnaround costs operating ebitda was 993 million down 24 percent from operating ebitda of 1 3 billion in the

systems texturants despite sequential growth from the fourth quarter 2018 probiotics realized a year over year volume decline due to higher than average sales in the first quarter of 2018 industrial biosciences volume declines were primarily the result of ongoing challenged conditions in u s energy markets negatively impacting demand in bioactives and microbial control operating ebitda for the

spokane wash may 02 2019 globe newswire avista corp nyse ava today reported net income attributable to avista corp shareholders of 115 8 million or 1 76 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 54 9 million or 0 83 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 our consolidated earnings were below our expectations for the first quarter however we remain on track to meet our guidance for the full year our first quarter 2019 earnings were positively impacted by the receipt of the termination fee from hydro one said scott morris chairman and chief executive officer of avista corp avista utilities had lower earnings due to below normal hydroelectric generation and higher natural gas fuel prices which caused an increase in net power supply costs we still expect to be in a benefit position in our energy recovery mechanism in washington in 2019 in addition we also had higher income taxes during the quarter on april 30 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing the purpose of our general rate case requests is to recover the costs associated with our capital investments to replace infrastructure that has reached the end of its useful life as well as respond to the need for reliability and technology investments required to build an integrated energy services grid ael p and our other businesses each had a good start to the year for the full year of 2019 we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs morris said summary results avista corp s results for the first quarter of 2019 as compared

and state combined of 23 05 percent b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following an increase in net power supply costs due to lower hydroelectric generation as well as higher purchased power prices and natural gas fuel prices this caused the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington to decrease from a 4 9 million pre tax benefit for the first quarter of 2018 to a 2 5 million pre tax expense for the first quarter of 2019 for the full year of 2019 we expect to be in a benefit position under the erm within the 75 percent customer 25 percent company sharing band the above decreases were partially offset by general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail electric revenue in the first quarter of 2019 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in the first quarter of 2019 d other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 increased as a result of an increase in generation and distribution operating and maintenance costs and employee incentive and benefit costs e merger transaction costs were 19 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2018 the merger transaction costs increased for the first quarter because 2018 costs consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2019 costs included consulting banking fees and legal fees in addition to employee time none of the acquisition costs are being passed through to customers during 2017 and 2018 a portion of the merger transaction costs which reduced income before income taxes were not deductible for tax purposes however now that the transaction has been terminated all the transaction costs are deductible as a result we recognized an additional tax benefit during 2019 of 1 8 million related to transaction costs from prior years which has been reflected in this line item the 19 7 million pre tax transaction costs incurred in 2019 were taxed at our statutory rate of 23 05 percent f depreciation and amortization increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additions to utility plant g interest expense increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additional outstanding debt during 2019 as compared to 2018 as well as an increase in interest rates h as a result of the termination of the proposed merger hydro one paid avista corp a 103 million termination fee in january 2019 the termination fee was used for reimbursing our transaction costs incurred from 2017 to 2019 these costs including income taxes totaled approximately 51 million the balance of the termination fee was used for general corporate purposes and reduced our need for external financing i other for the first quarter of 2019 were decreases to earnings primarily due to an increase in property taxes j our effective tax rate was 20 6 percent for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 16 3 percent for the first quarter of 2018 we expect our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 16 percent to 17 percent k the increase in earnings at our other businesses was primarily because the first quarter of 2018 included expenses associated with a renovation project also there were increased earnings from equity investments in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following table presents avista utilities operating revenues resource

liquidity we have a 400 0 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 as of march 31 2019 we had 220 9 million of available liquidity under this line of credit we also had 25 0 million of available liquidity under ael p s committed line of credit that expires in november 2019 in 2019 we expect to issue approximately 165 million of long term debt and up to 50 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures and other investments avista utilities capital expenditures were 92 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and we expect avista utilities capital expenditures to total about 405 million in 2019 we expect ael p s capital expenditures to total about 9 million in 2019 in addition we expect to invest about 19 million at our other businesses in 2019 this is mainly related to economic development projects in our service territory intended to demonstrate the latest energy and environmental building innovations and house several local college degree programs 2019 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is confirming its 2019 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs we expect to experience regulatory lag during the period 2019 through 2021 on april 30 2019 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter of 2019 we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an annual earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 with a return to our normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate following 2022 the earnings growth rates are based on the mid point of our 2019 earnings guidance as the starting point and exclude the 1 01 per diluted share related to the hydro one transaction these growth rates also assume timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2019 earnings guidance range encompasses unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2019 guidance range includes regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 105 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 5 percent in 2019 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 2 72 to 2 86 per diluted share for 2019 this includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 75 percent customer 25 percent company sharing band which is expected to add approximately 0 05 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and below normal hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year for 2019 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 09 to 0 13 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year we expect the other businesses to be

release references to oil sands operations exclude suncor s interests in fort hills and syncrude calgary alberta may 01 2019 globe newswire suncor s integrated model has consistently generated positive results through changing market conditions including mandatory production curtailments in alberta and the first quarter of 2019 was no different said mark little president and chief operating officer funds from operations increased to 2 6 billion in the first quarter of 2019 as we continue to execute on our long term strategy funds from operations were 2 585 billion 1 64 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 164 billion 1 32 per common share in the prior year quarter cash flow provided by operating activities which includes changes in non cash working capital was 1 548 billion 0 98 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 724 million 0 44 per common share in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable and inventory operating earnings were 1 209 billion 0 77 per common share and net earnings were 1 470 billion 0 93 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of 985 million 0 60 per common share and net earnings of 789 million 0 48 per common share in the prior year quarter refining and marketing r m delivered record quarterly funds from operations and operating earnings of 1 253 billion and 1 009 billion respectively total oil sands production was 657 200 barrels per day bbls d compared to 571 700 bbls d in the prior year quarter increased production from the ramp up at fort hills and improved syncrude asset utilization of 90 more than offset the impact of mandatory production curtailments implemented by the government of alberta oil sands operations achieved 98 upgrader utilization and synthetic crude oil sco production of 341 200 bbls d despite the impact of mandatory production curtailments on bitumen production hebron production in the first quarter increased to 18 300 bbls d net to the company and is continuing to ramp up following the completion of the fifth production well during the quarter first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 the company distributed 662 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 514 million of common shares in the first quarter of 2019 financial results operating earnings suncor s first quarter 2019 operating earnings were 1 209 billion 0 77 per common share compared to 985 million 0 60 per common share in the prior year quarter and included the impact of the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailments as well as after tax insurance proceeds of 264 million related to the company s assets in libya operating earnings were also favourably influenced by an inventory valuation gain associated with improving crude prices increased overall upstream production and sales volumes narrower heavy crude oil differentials and strong sales from the company s refining assets these factors were offset by lower wti benchmark crude pricing and higher overall operating and transportation costs predominantly attributed to the production ramp up at fort hills an increase in share based compensation costs and an additional 5 working interest in syncrude acquired partway through the first quarter of 2018 operating earnings were also unfavourably impacted by higher royalties associated with the improvement in both bitumen pricing and production the overall impact of crude oil and refined product inventory valuation had a net positive impact on operating earnings of 288 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 86 million net positive impact in the prior year quarter the increase was due to a favourable first in first out fifo inventory valuation adjustment associated with the consumption of less expensive crude feedstock in r m partially offset by a deferral of profit on intersegment sales from oil sands to r m remaining in inventory recorded in the corporate and eliminations segment net earnings net earnings were 1 470 billion 0 93 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net earnings of 789 million 0 48 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors explained in operating earnings above net earnings for the first quarter of 2019 included a 261 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt net earnings in the prior year quarter included an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 329 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a 133 million non cash after tax gain in the exploration and production e p segment associated with the exchange of the company s mineral landholdings in northeast british columbia with canbriam energy inc canbriam the company s investment in canbriam was subsequently written down to nil in the fourth quarter of 2018 following an assessment of forward natural gas prices and the impact on estimated future cash flows funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 585 billion 1 64 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 164 billion 1 32 per common share in the first quarter of 2018 and were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was 1 548 billion 0 98 per common share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 724 million 0 44 per common share for the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable and inventory in addition to the items noted with respect to funds from operations cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by the use of less cash in the company s working capital balances in the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter this was due to a decrease in taxes paid and a smaller increase in the company s inventory value with the prior year quarter including a substantial build of product inventory in preparation for the full turnaround at the edmonton refinery in the second quarter of 2018 operating results suncor s total upstream production was 764 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d during the first quarter of 2019 compared to 689 400 boe d in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the ramp up of fort hills production improved asset reliability at syncrude and the hebron ramp up this was partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments in the province of alberta which took effect at the beginning of the year our upgraders achieved strong reliability throughout the first quarter and our refining business generated record funds from operations illustrating the resiliency of suncor s cash flow and operational flexibility when broader industry challenges exist said mark little oil sands operations production was 396 600 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 404 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease was due to mandatory production curtailments which primarily affected the company s non upgraded bitumen sales as the company maximized the production of higher value sco barrels upgrader utilization improved to 98 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 80 in the prior year quarter with the prior year quarter being impacted by a weather related outage higher upgrader utilization resulted in a decrease to total oil sands operations production due to the approximate 20 yield loss associated with the bitumen upgrading process oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel were 29 95 in the first quarter of 2019 an increase from 26 85 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of mandatory production curtailments and the change in production mix associated with a higher proportion of sco production and lower bitumen volumes in addition to an increase in operating selling and general os g costs oil sands operations os g costs in the first quarter of 2019 included an increase in overburden stripping expenses during the optimal time of the year to complete this work the company expects the increase in this activity in the current period to partially offset oil sands operations cash operating costs in subsequent periods bringing oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel in line with guidance for 2019 total oil sands operations cash operating costs were 1 074 billion compared to 982 million in the prior year quarter and were also impacted by higher natural gas pricing suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 78 400 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 24 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase in production attributed to the ramp up of operations throughout the past year partially offset by mandatory production curtailments fort hills cash operating costs per barrel were 29 60 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 53 65 in the prior year quarter with the improvement primarily attributed to the increase in production despite the mandatory production curtailments suncor s share of syncrude production was 182 200 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 142 300 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in production was primarily due to stronger asset reliability with the prior year quarter impacted by a constrained bitumen feed line and the advancement of upgrader maintenance partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments upgrader utilization at syncrude improved to 90 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 71 in the prior year quarter to help achieve this suncor allocated a portion of its mandated production limit by the alberta government to syncrude which reduced lower value bitumen sales at oil sands operations syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 37 05 in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 50 75 in the prior year quarter due to the combination of higher production and lower os g costs resulting from a decrease in maintenance expenses partially offset by the increase in natural gas prices production volumes at e p were 107 100 boe d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 117 700 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to the continuing staged return of white rose to full operations as well as natural declines in the united kingdom partially offset by the increase in production from hebron during the first quarter of 2019 the company received 363 million in insurance proceeds for its libyan assets 264 million after tax the proceeds may be subject to a provisional repayment that may be dependent on the future performance and cash flows from suncor s libyan assets first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to ramp up to an estimated peak of 10 500 bbls d net to suncor in 2020 suncor is a 30 partner in the project refinery crude throughput was 444 900 bbls d and refinery utilization was 96 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 453 500 bbls d and a utilization rate of 98 in the prior year quarter with solid reliability achieved in both quarters refined products sales increased in the first quarter of 2019 to 542 800 bbls d compared to 512 900 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase attributed to record canadian wholesale sales volumes and higher retail sales volumes strategy update suncor s 2019 capital program is focused on the enhancement and optimization of the company s operating asset performance safety and reliability including projects focused on delivering increased earnings and funds from operations through further cost savings and structural margin improvements in addition the company is developing step out opportunities and asset extensions within the offshore business in e p excluding capitalized interest the company invested 875 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 1 214 billion in the prior year quarter this was due primarily to the decrease in capital associated with the staged completion and commissioning of the fort hills extraction plants in the first half of 2018 as well as a decrease in asset sustainment and maintenance capital associated with lower overall planned maintenance preparation expenditures following the execution of a more significant maintenance program in the spring of 2018 at both oil sands and r m although capital spending was lower in the first quarter of 2019 the company s capital guidance range of 4 9 billion to 5 6 billion remains unchanged drilling activity at hebron is ongoing and production continues to ramp up ahead of schedule other e p activity in the first quarter included development drilling at hibernia white rose and buzzard and development work on the west white rose project and the norwegian oda and fenja projects during the first quarter of 2019 suncor s board of directors approved a 17 dividend increase and up to an additional 2 0 billion in authority for share repurchases also in the first quarter the company continued to return value to shareholders through dividends of 662 million and a repurchase of 514

the termination fee from hydro one said scott morris chairman and chief executive officer of avista corp avista utilities had lower earnings due to below normal hydroelectric generation and higher natural gas fuel prices which caused an increase in net power supply costs we still expect to be in a benefit position in our energy recovery mechanism in washington in 2019 in addition we also had higher income taxes during the quarter on april 30 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing the purpose of our general rate case requests is to recover the costs associated with our capital investments to replace infrastructure that has reached the end of its useful life as well as respond to the need for reliability and technology investments required to build an integrated energy services grid ael p and our other businesses each had a good start to the year for the full year of 2019 we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining

tax impact of each line item was calculated using avista corp s statutory tax rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following an increase in net power supply costs due to lower hydroelectric generation as well as higher purchased power prices and natural gas fuel prices this caused the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington to decrease from a 4 9 million pre tax benefit for the first quarter of 2018 to a 2 5 million pre tax expense for the first quarter of 2019 for the full year of 2019 we expect to be in a benefit position under the erm within the 75 percent customer 25 percent company sharing band the above decreases were partially offset by general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail electric revenue in the first quarter of 2019 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted primarily by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective january 1 2019 and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in the first quarter of 2019 d other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 increased as a result of an increase in generation and distribution operating and maintenance costs and employee incentive and benefit costs e merger transaction costs were 19 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 7 million pre tax for the first quarter of 2018 the merger transaction costs increased for the first quarter because 2018 costs consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2019 costs included consulting banking fees and legal fees in addition to employee time none of the acquisition costs are being passed through to customers during 2017 and 2018 a portion of the merger transaction costs which reduced income before income taxes were not deductible for tax purposes however now that the transaction has been terminated all the transaction costs are deductible as a result we recognized an additional tax benefit during 2019 of 1 8 million related to transaction costs from prior years which has been reflected in this line item the 19 7 million pre tax transaction costs incurred in 2019 were taxed at our statutory rate of 23 05 percent f depreciation and amortization increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additions to utility plant g interest expense increased for the first quarter of 2019 due to additional outstanding debt during 2019 as compared to 2018 as well as an increase in interest rates h as a result of the termination of the proposed merger hydro one paid avista corp a 103 million termination fee in january 2019 the termination fee was used for reimbursing our transaction costs incurred from 2017 to 2019 these costs including income taxes totaled approximately 51 million the balance of the termination fee was used for general corporate purposes and reduced our need for external financing i other for the first quarter of 2019 were decreases to earnings primarily due to an increase in property taxes j our effective tax rate was 20 6 percent for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 16 3 percent for the first quarter of 2018 we expect our full year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 16 percent to 17 percent k the increase in earnings at our other businesses was primarily because the first quarter of 2018 included expenses associated with a renovation project also there were increased earnings from equity investments in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following table presents avista utilities operating revenues resource costs and resulting utility margin pre tax and after tax for the three months

april 2021 as of march 31 2019 we had 220 9 million of available liquidity under this line of credit we also had 25 0 million of available liquidity under ael p s committed line of credit that expires in november 2019 in 2019 we expect to issue approximately 165 million of long term debt and up to 50 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures and other investments avista utilities capital expenditures were 92 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and we expect avista utilities capital expenditures to total about 405 million in 2019 we expect ael p s capital expenditures to total about 9 million in 2019 in addition we expect to invest about 19 million at our other businesses in 2019 this is mainly related to economic development projects in our service territory intended to demonstrate the latest energy and environmental building innovations and house several local college degree programs 2019 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is confirming its 2019 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs we expect to experience regulatory lag during the period 2019 through 2021 on april 30 2019 we filed general rates cases in washington that are two year rate plans we also filed a general rate case in oregon in march and we expect to file general rate cases in idaho in the second quarter of 2019 we expect these cases to provide rate relief in early 2020 and begin reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an annual earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 with a return to our normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate following 2022 the earnings growth rates are based on the mid point of our 2019 earnings guidance as the starting point and exclude the 1 01 per diluted share related to the hydro one transaction these growth rates also assume timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2019 earnings guidance range encompasses unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2019 guidance range includes regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 105 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 5 percent in 2019 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 2 72 to 2 86 per diluted share for 2019 this includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 75 percent customer 25 percent company sharing band which is expected to add approximately 0 05 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and below normal hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year for 2019 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 09 to 0 13 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year we expect the other businesses to be between a loss of 0 03 and a loss of 0 01 per diluted share which includes costs associated with exploring strategic opportunities our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions dispositions until the effects are known and certain note we will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on may 2 2019 at 10 30 a m edt to discuss

direct distribution ownership structures may a foreign supplier establish its own entity to import and distribute its products in your jurisdiction generally yes unless the supplier s country the supplier itself or its principal is the subject of a trade embargo or sanctions as of december 2018 the countries on the embargo list are the crimea region of ukraine cuba iran north korea and syria in addition there are sanctions affecting specified persons and categories of persons relating to the following countries or areas afghanistan the balkans belarus burundi central african republic democratic republic of the congo iraq lebanon libya nicaragua russia somalia south sudan venezuela yemen and zimbabwe the lists of embargoed countries and sanctioned individuals and entities are maintained by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of treasury for details see the ofac sanctions page at www treasury gov resource center sanctions there are also certain industries in which foreign ownership is restricted or regulated either nationally or by certain states such as defence contracting banking and alcoholic beverages may a foreign supplier be a partial owner with a local company of the importer of its products generally yes subject to the embargoes sanctions and certain industries noted in question 1 what types of business entities are best suited for an importer owned by a foreign supplier how are they formed what laws govern them any importer whether foreign owned or not should operate through a form of entity whose liability is limited to the assets of the entity to minimise the risk of the owners assets being available to satisfy claims for the activities of the business the most common of these are the corporation and the limited liability company llc these are formed under state law by filing documents with the chosen us state and that state s laws will govern the entity as to its internal governance and the relationships among the owners and the entity while llcs are generally more flexible with respect to governance economic structure and corporate formalities for a foreign parent a corporation will often be preferable from a tax perspective depending on applicable tax treaties between the united states and the foreign parent s home jurisdiction as well as the tax laws of that jurisdiction see question 6 restrictions does your jurisdiction restrict foreign businesses from operating in the jurisdiction or limit foreign investment in or ownership of domestic business entities generally there are no restrictions subject to the responses to questions 1 and 2 us states generally do require if an entity is doing business in the state that it qualify to do business which involves a filing with the state agreement to be subject to jurisdiction of the state and appointment of an agent for service of legal process in the state the definition of doing business varies somewhat by state and is extremely fact based but generally includes the operation of a business facility in the state typically a company that fails to qualify when it is required to do so will not be entitled to maintain any action or proceeding in the courts of the state of course there are likely to be tax consequences for a foreign business that operates directly in the united states equity interests may the foreign supplier own an equity interest in the local entity that distributes its products see questions 1 and 2 tax considerations what are the tax considerations for foreign suppliers and for the formation of an importer owned by a foreign supplier what taxes are applicable to foreign businesses and individuals that operate in your jurisdiction or own interests in local businesses foreign businesses and individuals are generally subject to federal national us income tax on their taxable income that is deemed to be effectively connected with a us trade or business effectively connected income or eci at the normal rates applicable to us persons non us persons must file a us income tax return to report such income and may deduct the expenses of the us business a foreign corporation that has eci is subject to an additional 30 per cent us branch profits tax on its after tax net income a foreign person is also subject to a 30 per cent us withholding tax on us source fixed or determinable annual or periodic income which generally includes dividend income if a foreign entity provides services in the us and those services are performed by employees of the foreign entity the foreign entity will be engaged in a us business this means that the foreign entity will have to file a us tax return and report and pay tax on its eci from those services also if the foreign entity invested in a us operating business directly or through an entity treated as a partnership for us tax purposes the foreign entity itself would be required to file a us tax return and pay taxes on its share of any eci generated by the operating business in order to alleviate both the implications of having to file a tax return in the us and the payment of the branch profits tax the foreign entity could establish a us subsidiary corporation to employ the individuals who will perform services in the us or to hold the foreign parent s investment in a us operating business the us subsidiary would file a us tax return and would be subject to us tax at regular us corporate income tax rates on the income generated by the us business less its business expenses if the us subsidiary makes any distributions to the foreign parent during the time that it was operating or holding an investment in a business in the us the distributions would be subject to a us dividend withholding tax at a rate of 30 per cent or any lesser rate provided in an applicable income tax treaty between the us and the foreign entity s home country when the us subsidiary sells its us business or its investment in a us business the us subsidiary would be subject to us tax on any net gain realised on the sale however the us subsidiary could then fully liquidate and distribute the proceeds from its business or its investment to its foreign parent and that liquidating distribution would not be subject to us withholding taxes accordingly a foreign business or individual can avoid a second level of us tax ie branch profits tax or dividend withholding tax on its us business or its investment in a us business if it makes its investment through a wholly owned us corporation and the us corporation does not make any distributions to the foreign parent until it fully liquidates however depending on the tax rules of jurisdiction where the foreign business is located and the structure of the foreign company it may be preferable to structure the us subsidiary entity as a us partnership that elects to be treated as a corporation for us tax purposes this structure will have the same us tax benefits of investment through a us corporation as discussed above and may also allow the investing company or its equity owners to receive a tax credit in its local jurisdiction for the us corporate taxes paid by the us subsidiary often income tax treaties between the us and other countries can affect the preferred structure and offer opportunities to reduce the total tax burden from a foreign business s us operations local distributors and commercial agents distribution structures what distribution structures are available to a supplier the options for distribution for the most part are limited only by the creativity of the business people structuring the relationship the most common are discussed below direct distribution distribution by the foreign supplier using its own employees or through a subsidiary see questions 1 to 6 commercial agents and sales representatives the agent does not purchase or take title to the goods but rather sells them on behalf of the foreign supplier and receives a commission matters such as who actually delivers the product who generates the invoice how risk of non payment is shared and other logistical matters may be addressed by contract together with a definition of each party s duties and how the relationship may be terminated independent distributors the supplier contracts with an independent distributor that buys goods from the supplier taking title to those goods and resells them at a profit to its own customers the details of the relationship including the responsibilities of each side and the parties rights to terminate are defined by contract franchising franchising under the typical definition amounts to the use of independent distributors who are licensed to use the supplier s trademarks either in the business name or in the products sold are required to follow a prescribed marketing plan or method of operation and pay a franchise fee to the supplier the specific definition and the consequences of being deemed a franchise vary from state to state in many us states franchises are regulated in one or both of two ways first many states and the federal trade commission ftc require disclosure documents in a prescribed format to be provided to the prospective franchisee and in some states to be registered with the state second some states regulate the substance of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee in various ways most notably by restricting the franchisor s right to terminate or not renew the relationship except for statutorily defined good cause often requiring a specified period in which the franchisee may cure any default states that regulate franchising often require franchisors to submit to jurisdiction and appoint an agent for service of process in the franchisee s state joint ventures a joint venture can be established by a foreign supplier with its distribution partner in the us whether the partner is an agent distributor or franchisee by having the local distribution entity owned in part by the supplier directly or through a subsidiary or through another form of sharing of profits and expenses an ownership interest can provide greater control through ownership rights and representation on a board of directors or management committee licensing of manufacturing rights a foreign supplier may license a us manufacturer to use its intellectual property patent copyright trademark or trade secrets to make its products locally and sell them while all the implications of licensing intellectual property are beyond the scope of this chapter care must be taken by the licensor to maintain quality control over the finished product and the use of the intellectual property failure to do so can not only put the brand equity at risk but also risk the loss of trademark protection private label distribution of products under a private label amounts to a reverse licensing arrangement where a us distributor or retailer distributes the foreign supplier s products under the us business s own trademark in essence the supplier gives up its own brand name in exchange for the distribution strength of its us partner with the supplier reaping no enhanced brand value control over sales distribution marketing and advertising are in the hands of the local brand owner resulting in negligible distribution costs to the supplier and virtually no control save perhaps for sales and performance benchmarks in the contract with benefits to the supplier limited to its profits on sales of the product legislation and regulators what laws and government agencies regulate the relationship between a supplier and its distributor agent or other representative are there industry self regulatory constraints or other restrictions that may govern the distribution relationship by and large the relationship between supplier and distribution partner is governed by contract which the parties are free to structure as they wish notable exceptions are i business franchises which are regulated by federal disclosure requirements and by various state disclosure registration and relationship laws discussed briefly in question 7 and ii federal and state laws governing certain industries which can regulate the right of a supplier to terminate a distribution relationship among other aspects of the relationship there are federal laws governing automobile dealers and petroleum products retailers gas stations many states have similar laws for those industries and there are state laws governing beer wine spirits farm equipment and occasionally other industries understanding the laws and regulations governing businesses and individuals in the us is complicated by the fact that there is regulation at the national federal and state level by each of the 50 us states washington dc and us territories and possessions such as puerto rico the us virgin islands and guam many industries have adopted codes of conduct applicable to companies in the industry which suppliers often incorporate into their distribution agreements so they become part of the contract some companies incorporate similar codes of conduct that they have adopted individually such incorporated codes of conduct are enforceable just like any other contract provision contract termination are there any restrictions on a supplier s right to terminate a distribution relationship without cause if permitted by contract is any specific cause required to terminate a distribution relationship do the answers differ for a decision not to renew the distribution relationship when the contract term expires again the parties freedom to contract generally governs the distribution relationship including the parties right to terminate or not renew the relationship without cause or for specified reasons as indicated in question 8 however some states laws restrict the ability of franchisors and of suppliers in certain industries to end a relationship where a statutory restriction exists it often prohibits termination without good cause just cause or a similar formulation such cause is often narrowly defined and typically does not include poor performance but often does include a material failure to comply with reasonable contractual requirements which makes clearly drafted and substantively reasonable contractual performance standards important moreover many states require that before termination occurs the franchisee or distributor be given a specified period of time often 60 or 90 days in which to cure any deficiency or breach the statutory good cause requirements typically but not universally apply equally to a failure to renew a contract on expiry in the absence of such a statute however there is generally no restriction on the parties ability to agree on the conditions for termination with or without cause is any mandatory compensation or indemnity required to be paid in the event of a termination without cause or otherwise when an applicable statute restricts termination without good cause as discussed in question 9 or where a termination violates a contract s terms the wrongfully terminated distributor may recover damages and in some cases may be able to obtain injunctive relief preventing termination the requirements for injunctive relief vary from state to state but typically require irreparable harm not adequately compensable with money damages that is often interpreted to mean a likely inability for the business to survive in its current form where damages are to be awarded the amount will vary from state to state and usually is not defined by any specific formula or multiple of profits or sales often the damages will be defined as the fair market value of the distributor s business in the terminated product lines ie what a willing buyer and a willing seller neither under compulsion to deal would agree on for the price of the business damages may also be calculated as the net present value of the profits that would be earned by the distributor in the absence of termination in the absence of an applicable statute or breach of contract damages will not be assessed for a proper termination transfer of rights or ownership will your jurisdiction enforce a distribution contract provision prohibiting the transfer of the distribution rights to the supplier s products all or part of the ownership of the distributor or agent or the distributor or agent s business to a third party in general yes however as discussed in question 8 there may be specific laws applicable to certain industries that affect the enforceability of such provisions regulation of the distribution relationship confidentiality agreements are there limitations on the extent to which your jurisdiction will enforce confidentiality provisions in distribution agreements confidentiality agreements are generally enforced as written subject to normal contract defences such as fraud or unconscionability and subject to the obligation to disclose information in legal proceedings and government investigations us courts have broad disclosure requirements and the presence of a confidentiality provision will not shield information from discovery if it is material and necessary in the prosecution or defence of an action while courts disfavour protective orders to maintain the confidentiality of information filed with the court they can be obtained where necessary to protect competitively valuable information or in other cases where good cause can be shown particularly where the parties to a litigation can agree and confidentiality agreements between litigating parties are not unusual to protect sensitive information provided in discovery information disclosed to government agencies may be subject to public disclosure under federal or state freedom of information laws although there are exceptions and protection of sensitive information should be discussed with the government prior to disclosure it is prudent to include in confidentiality agreements a provision calling for advance notice and cooperation from the party being compelled to disclose to the extent permitted prior to making a disclosure required by law so that the party whose sensitive information may be disclosed can seek appropriate protection confidentiality agreements in the us typically exclude from protection information that the receiving party can demonstrate i was already known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure ii became public without fault of the receiving party iii is developed independently by the receiving party without reference to confidential information of the disclosing party or iv is learned by the receiving party from a third party not owing any obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party where the information to be protected is not in fact confidential as in these situations a court may not enforce the agreement trade secrets information that is not generally known and provides a competitive advantage to the owner will be protected from disclosure or misappropriation where the owner has taken appropriate steps to maintain confidentiality including obtaining written confidentiality agreements from all employees and others to whom the information is disclosed competing products are restrictions on the distribution of competing products in distribution agreements enforceable either during the term of the relationship or afterwards in the absence of market power a supplier generally is free to restrict a distributor s sales of competing products although some state laws limit this ability where exclusive dealing requirements are so broad as to foreclose a substantial portion of the market they may be found unlawful as an unreasonable restraint of trade under the antitrust competition laws restrictions that extend beyond the term of a distribution agreement are disfavoured in some states and generally must be ancillary to the contract and in furtherance of its lawful purposes as well as reasonable as to i the products restricted ii the geographical scope of the restriction and iii duration where a supplier provides a turnkey operation as in a classic franchise and discloses all the details of how to operate the business such post term restrictions may be more broadly permitted particularly if they are short in duration and cover a limited geographical area prices may a supplier control the prices at which its distribution partner resells its products if not how are these restrictions enforced in general us antitrust laws such as section 1 of the sherman act in the absence of monopoly power address concerted action not unilateral conduct thus if the supplier itself is making the sale as with owned outlets a controlled subsidiary or in most jurisdictions through a true agent the pricing is unilateral and usually not problematic but an agreement between independent entities in which the supplier regulates the resale prices of a distributor franchisee or licensee raises antitrust concerns even in the case of a purported unilateral policy eg an announced supplier policy to deal only with retailers that maintain the manufacturer s suggested resale price msrp care must be taken to enforce the policy strictly lax enforcement can be construed as coercion of a resale price maintenance agreement rather than mere establishment of a unilateral policy see question 15 in 2007 the us supreme court held in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc that all vertical agreements ie agreements between buyer and seller even as to resale prices are judged under federal law by the rule of reason under which the court must determine whether the anticompetitive harm from the conduct is outweighed by potential competitive benefits rather than by the per se rule which makes conduct unlawful without regard to any claimed justifications in leegin the supreme court noted a variety of situations in which resale price maintenance rpm may be anticompetitive and suggested several factors relevant to the rule of reason inquiry including the number of suppliers using rpm in the industry the more manufacturers using rpm the more likely it could facilitate a supplier or dealer cartel the source of the restraint if dealers are the impetus for a vertical price restraint it is more likely to facilitate a dealer cartel or support a dominant inefficient dealer and where either the supplier or dealer involved has market power importantly the states do not always follow federal precedent in enforcing their own antitrust laws and so may not follow leegin indeed some states have antitrust statutes that explicitly bar rpm programmes thus some state authorities will apply the per se rule to rpm under state law the result is a patchwork of states accepting or rejecting the leegin approach in enforcing state antitrust laws consequently before implementing any rpm programme counsel must carefully examine each relevant state s treatment of rpm especially as state law continues to develop review all the facts and determine whether any of the factors described by the supreme court in leegin are present or whether there are other indications that the proposed programme will have anticompetitive effects rather than enhancing interbrand competition may a supplier influence resale prices in other ways such as suggesting resale prices establishing a minimum advertised price policy announcing it will not deal with customers who do not follow its pricing policy or otherwise it is lawful in the us for a supplier to suggest resale prices so long as there is no enforcement mechanism and the customer remains truly free to set its own prices in addition under the rule announced in 1919 by the us supreme court in united states v colgate co a supplier may establish a unilateral policy against sales below the supplier s stated resale price levels and unilaterally choose not to do business with those that do not follow that policy because only agreements on resale pricing may be unlawful but care must be taken not to take steps that would convert such a unilateral policy into an agreement when a supplier s actions go beyond mere announcement of a policy and it employs other means to obtain adherence to its resale prices an rpm agreement can be created colgate policies can be notoriously difficult to administer because salespeople often try to persuade a customer to adhere to the policy instead of simply terminating sales upon a violation with the resulting loss of sales to the salesperson and such efforts can be enough to take the seller out of the colgate safe harbour and into a potentially unlawful rpm situation minimum advertised price map policies that control the prices a supplier advertises but not the actual sales price are also generally permitted although the issue of what constitutes an advertised price for online sales can have almost metaphysical dimensions in order to avoid classification as rpm the map policy must not control the actual resale price but only the advertised price the closer to the point of sale that advertising is controlled the greater the risk thus in the bricks and mortar world policies restricting advertising in broadcast and print media are more likely to be permitted restrictions on in store signage would be riskier and restrictions on actual price tags on merchandise most likely would be deemed a restriction on actual rather than advertised price online sellers have most often restricted banner ads and the price shown when an item is displayed while restrictions on the price shown once a consumer places an item in his or her shopping cart carry a greater risk which explains why some items are displayed with the legend place item in cart for lower price where the supplier does not prohibit an advertised price inconsistent with the supplier s policy but instead as part of a cooperative advertising programme conditions reimbursement of all or a portion of the cost of an advertisement on compliance with a supplier s map policy the risk is reduced although not eliminated may a distribution contract specify that the supplier s price to the distributor will be no higher than its lowest price to other customers in general yes such most favoured customer clauses are widespread and courts generally have applied the rule of reason and found that such clauses do not unreasonably restrain trade in 2010 however the us department of justice filed an action in federal court in michigan against health insurer blue cross blue shield bcbs claiming its use of such clauses thwarted competition in violation of antitrust laws the department asserted that because of its market power bcbs harmed competition by requiring hospitals to agree to charge other insurers as much as 40 per cent more than they charged bcbs the case was voluntarily dismissed by the justice department after the state of michigan passed a law prohibiting health insurers from using most favoured customer clauses and in the apple computer e books case a federal district court found that a most favoured customer provision in apple s contracts with publishers that required the publishers to lower the price at which they sold e books in apple s store if the books were sold for less elsewhere notably by amazon com violated the antitrust laws the decision was affirmed on appeal by the us court of appeals for the second circuit apple sought us supreme court review however the court declined to review the decision the presence of most favoured customer clauses may also lead a supplier to reject an otherwise attractive offer from a customer to take surplus inventory at a lower price because the discounted price would have to be offered to all customers with a most favoured customer clause contract drafters should therefore examine whether a most favoured customer clause raises antitrust risks in the context of their client s particular market share and pricing practices with particular caution advisable where market power is present are there restrictions on a seller s ability to charge different prices to different customers based on location type of customer quantities purchased or otherwise yes the federal robinson patman act prohibits with certain exceptions price differences as well as discrimination in related services or facilities in contemporaneous interstate sales of commodities of like grade and quality for use or resale within the us that causes antitrust injury the basic principle is that big purchasers may not be favoured over small ones the robinson patman act also requires promotional programmes to be available to customers on a proportionally equal basis the act does not apply to services leases or export sales the statute is often criticised and is honoured more in the breach than the observance as quantity discounts are commonplace and government enforcement actions are rare private damage actions however are still brought with some frequency although the requirement of showing antitrust injury is often an obstacle to success to prevail under the statute a plaintiff must show that the price difference had a reasonable possibility of causing injury to competition or competitors a standard that has been tightened by recent case law there are two principal defences to a robinson patman act claim first showing that the price difference was justified by cost differences is a defence this defence however is notoriously difficult to establish requiring detailed data as to the cost differences applicable to the different sales at different prices second under the meeting competition defence prices may be lowered to meet but not beat a competitor s price where there is a good faith basis for believing the competitor actually made a lower offer if a copy of the competitor s invoice or price quotation cannot be obtained the company should gather as much information as possible to support the belief that the competitor offered the lower price the lower price must not however be confirmed with the competitor which could provide evidence supporting a horizontal price fixing conspiracy by the suppliers rather the supplier should obtain that information through other sources such as customer documentation or market surveys there are also state laws that restrict price discrimination some are generally applicable and modelled on the robinson patman act but apply to intrastate sales instead of or in addition to interstate sales others restrict locality discrimination charging different prices in different parts of a state some states such as california have unfair competition laws that prohibit below cost pricing which in certain circumstances may also violate federal law and the provision of secret and unearned rebates to only some competing buyers other state laws apply to specific industries such as motor vehicles or alcoholic beverages and prohibit discrimination in pricing to dealers geographic and customer restrictions may a supplier restrict the geographic areas or categories of customers to which its distribution partner resells are exclusive territories permitted may a supplier reserve certain customers to itself if not how are the limitations on such conduct enforced is there a distinction between active sales efforts and passive sales that are not actively solicited and how are those terms defined as a general rule yes non price vertical restraints are judged by the rule of reason in the united states and are generally permitted in the absence of market power customer and territory restrictions such as exclusive territories pursuant to which a distributor is allocated a specific territory outside of which it may not sell and within which no other distributor may sell the supplier s goods thus are governed by the rule of reason exclusive territories necessarily reduce intrabrand competition between distributors of the same products but by eliminating one distributor free riding on the promotional and service efforts of another and undercutting its price and thus making it feasible for the distributor to sustain those efforts exclusive territories enhance interbrand competition between suppliers of competing products and so are generally viewed as pro competitive on balance the distinction between active and passive selling applicable in europe is not generally relevant under us antitrust law another distinction from the european approach is that restrictions on online sales are viewed as a non price vertical restraint and so are judged by the rule of reason and generally permitted in the absence of market power courts have upheld prohibitions on mail order and telephone sales under the rule of reason and restrictions on internet sales even an absolute prohibition should be judged no differently however customer allocation by competitors is a horizontal arrangement rather than a vertical one and is per se illegal it is thus critical that the impetus for exclusive territories come from the supplier in a vertical arrangement and not from dealers or distributors making a horizontal allocation of territories many us cases apply a market power screen in rule of reason cases and uphold non price vertical restraints whenever the defendant lacks market power such restraints including exclusive territories will be viewed more sceptically if market power exists online sales may a supplier restrict or prohibit e commerce sales by its distribution partners as noted in response to question 18 restrictions on online sales are a non price vertical restraint judged by the rule of reason and generally permitted in the absence of market power courts have upheld prohibitions on mail order and telephone sales under the rule of reason and restrictions on internet sales even an absolute prohibition should be judged no differently the inherently borderless nature of e commerce means that e commerce sales if permitted or secondarily sourced may well adversely affect distributors into whose exclusive territories e commerce sales are made and may benefit distributors who have distribution centres of e commerce intermediaries located in their territories from which sales are made to the territories of other distributors these disproportionate effects may be dealt with in the contract by having the distributor that benefits from out of territory sales by an intermediary in its territory pay over an invasion fee or similar payment to the distributor into whose territory the sales are made of course this requires a determination of the number of transferred sales made by the intermediary if reporting of such sales can be obtained of course that determination is easy otherwise some kind of estimate is needed perhaps based on relative non e commerce sales volumes in the territories again though the fundamental freedom to contract applies and such determinations are permitted and becoming more common refusal to deal under what circumstances may a supplier refuse to deal with particular customers may a supplier restrict its distributor s ability to deal with particular customers in general a business that does not have market power is free to choose its customers and do business or not do business with whomever it wishes that can include restricting a distributor s ability to do business with particular customers or classes of customers a vertical restraint that will be judged by the rule of reason as discussed in questions 14 and 18 a supplier with market power will be more limited in its ability to engage in such practices if an adverse effect on competition can be shown in certain circumstances courts have found that a monopolist may have an obligation to deal or to continue dealing with its competitors note that an agreement among competitors at the same level of distribution not to deal with certain customers or to restrict with whom customers may deal will be treated as a horizontal per se illegal restraint rather than as a vertical restraint governed by the rule of reason thus where a restriction on dealing with certain customers originates with a group of competing distributors a supplier may be at risk of being found to be an illegal participant in that horizontal conspiracy where the same restraint originated by the supplier might well be lawful there may be some industries in some states where a supplier is required to deal with all customers for example in many states alcoholic beverage wholesalers must sell to all licensed retailers competition concerns under which circumstances might a distribution or agency agreement be deemed a reportable transaction under merger control rules and require clearance by the competition authority what standards would be used to evaluate such a transaction acquisitions of businesses or interests in businesses including a supplier s purchase of an ownership interest in a distributor may be subject to filing requirements and federal antitrust agency review if certain thresholds are met as to the size of the transaction more than us 84 4 million and the size of the parties if the value of a proposed transaction is more than us 337 6 million it is reportable if the value is more than us 84 4 million but less than us 337 6 million it is reportable if one party to the transaction has total assets or net sales of us 168 8 million or more and the other has total assets or net sales of us 16 9 million or more the above dollar amounts are adjusted annually for inflation new dollar thresholds are expected to be announced in early 2019 in the absence of an ownership interest however distribution relationships are not generally subject to antitrust reporting requirements or agency clearance procedures do your jurisdiction s antitrust or competition laws constrain the relationship between suppliers and their distribution partners in any other ways how are any such laws enforced and by which agencies can private parties bring actions under antitrust or competition laws what remedies are available as discussed in questions 14 and 18 vertical agreements between suppliers and distributors are generally governed by the rule of reason under which the anticompetitive effects of the restraint are weighed against any possible pro competitive effects and in the absence of market power will usually be found lawful in contrast horizontal agreements among competitors at the same level of distribution relating to matters such as pricing allocation of customers or territories or production levels are prohibited by the per se rule accordingly it is important for suppliers and distributors not only to avoid such agreements with their competitors but also to avoid putting themselves or their distribution partners into a position where they might be deemed participants in a horizontal conspiracy at either distribution partner s level of distribution thus suppliers should not exchange current or future pricing or production information with their competitors should not use their common distributors to facilitate such information exchanges should not share one distributor s pricing information with other distributors and should not agree to territorial allocations made by their distributors rather than imposed by the supplier distributors should not share with one supplier pricing or production information received from another similarly suppliers should not share information with each other about their common distributors as such exchanges could support a claim of a concerted refusal to deal should both suppliers then decide to terminate their relationships with the distributor returning to purely vertical relationships a supplier may not require its customers to purchase one product the tied product in order to be able to purchase another product the tying product if the supplier has substantial economic power in the tying product market and a not insubstantial amount of interstate or international commerce in the tied product is affected one of the difficult questions in a tying analysis is whether there are in fact two distinct products one of which is forced on customers who would not otherwise purchase it as a result of market power with respect to the other the antitrust laws are enforced both by government action and by private party litigation at the federal level both the us department of justice and the ftc enforce the antitrust laws they may seek criminal or civil enforcement penalties jail terms are not uncommon for antitrust violations especially horizontal ones maximum fines for each violation are us 1 million for individuals and us 100 million for corporations subject to being increased to twice the amount gained from the illegal acts or twice the money lost by the victims of the crime if either of those amounts is over us 100 million in addition both federal agencies can bring civil actions to enjoin violations of the antitrust laws disgorge profits impose structural remedies and recover substantial civil penalties the federal agencies often cooperate with foreign antitrust and competition authorities in investigating violations state attorneys general also actively prosecute antitrust cases and have similar authority to the federal agencies within their own states state antitrust laws also provide civil and criminal penalties and the states frequently cooperate with each other and with the federal agencies in multistate investigations and prosecutions last but certainly not least private plaintiffs may bring civil actions under the antitrust laws and recover treble damages that is three times the actual damages caused by the violation and attorneys fees not the usual rule in the us where each party generally pays its own legal fees regardless of who prevails the exposure in an antitrust action can thus be extremely high as can the costs of litigation parallel imports are there ways in which a distributor or agent can prevent parallel or grey market imports into its territory of the supplier s products importation of goods bearing a registered trademark even if genuine can be blocked through the us customs and border protection service cbp provided the non us manufacturer is not affiliated with the us trademark owner under the tariff act which prohibits the importation of a product manufactured abroad that bears a trademark owned by a citizen of the united states the cbp can also block genuine trademarked goods not intended for the us market even if the non us manufacturer is affiliated if the goods are physically and materially different from the goods intended for sale in the us however the grey importer can bring in the products if a disclaimer is affixed stating that the goods are materially and physically different from the authorised us goods in addition where parallel imported goods are materially different from the us goods in quality features warranty or the like a trademark infringement claim is possible where customer confusion is likely there is no current ability to restrict grey market importation under a copyright theory the supreme court held in 2013 in kirtsaeng v john wiley sons inc that a copyright owner cannot exercise control over a copyrighted work after its first sale even if that first sale occurs outside the us moreover reliance on an insubstantial element of a product protected by copyright to attempt to block parallel imports may be held to be copyright misuse which prevents enforcement of the copyright until recently grey market importation of products protected by a us patent infringed the patent even if the products were lawfully sold abroad with the authority of the patent holder however in 2017 the us supreme court held in impression prods inc v lexmark int l inc that an authorised sale abroad of a product protected by a us patent exhausted the patentee s right to prevent importation into the united states accordingly patent law has been changed to conform to copyright law as discussed above advertising what restrictions exist on the ability of a supplier or distributor to advertise and market the products it sells may a supplier pass all or part of its cost of advertising on to its distribution partners or share in its cost of advertising advertising is regulated by both federal and state laws that prohibit false misleading or deceptive advertising where advertising makes statements that could reasonably be interpreted as an objective factual claim in contrast to statements such as world s best water that are more likely to be regarded as marketing puff the advertiser must have reasonable substantiating documentation to support the claim before the advertising is disseminated federally advertising is regulated principally by the ftc the ftc has broad authority under the ftc act to prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices and more specific authority to prohibit misleading claims for food drugs devices services and cosmetics the ftc can sue in the federal courts and often will enter into consent orders with defendants in advance of litigation that may incorporate a variety of remedies the ftc considers advertising deceptive if it contains misrepresentations or omissions likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably to their detriment while the ftc must show the deception was material to consumers purchasing decisions it does not have to show actual injury to consumers similarly the ftc deems advertising to be unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial consumer injury that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition the most common remedy in advertising cases is an order to enjoin the conduct complained of and prevent future violations where such an order is not enough to correct misunderstandings caused by misleading advertising the ftc may order corrective advertising in addition the ftc may seek other consumer redress or disgorgement of profits and in the case of violations of prior orders or trade regulation rules civil penalties the states regulate advertising in similar ways under a variety of state unfair competition and unfair trade practice statutes these are enforced by the state attorneys general in a manner similar to the ftc finally private parties often competitors can bring actions in the state and federal courts to enjoin or seek damages for false or deceptive advertising that causes harm to competitors or consumers there are additional restrictions on specific types of advertising sweepstakes in which prizes are awarded by chance to consumers who have made a purchase or provided some other consideration are regulated by many states some of which require prior registration endorsements are regulated most notably by the ftc endorsement guidelines which are intended to ensure that statements of third party endorsers reflect an honest statement of the endorser s opinion and are substantiated to the same extent as required for the advertiser s own statements the guidelines require among other things disclosure of any relationship between the endorser and the supplier of the product including requiring the supplier to ensure that bloggers who review a product disclose when the supplier provided a free sample for evaluation and that employees who comment on their employer s products or services on social media or websites disclose that relationship finally there are specific regulations governing certain claims such as those asserting health benefits or claiming green products and many industries have adopted self regulatory advertising codes that should be followed there are no restrictions on suppliers requiring reimbursement or contributions for advertising costs from distribution partners or on distribution partners agreeing to share in the advertising expenses freedom of contract governs and it is commonplace to include provisions governing the sharing of advertising costs or the contribution from each party to advertising funds to support the products being distributed intellectual property how may a supplier safeguard its intellectual property from infringement by its distribution partners and by third parties are technology transfer agreements common trademarks trademarks receive some protection by virtue of use in the us under the federal lanham act and under the common law of the states where they are used the preferable more effective way to protect trademarks in the us is to obtain trademark registrations through the us patent and trademark office us trademark registrations can be based on a supplier s home country trademark registration or on use in interstate or foreign commerce in the us applications can also be based on an intent to use the trademark in the us but the registration will not be issued until the supplier has submitted proof of actual use in the us us federal trademark registration can also be obtained under the madrid protocol if the supplier s home country is a signatory to the treaty only the owner of a trademark may obtain a us registration accordingly in general the supplier not the local distributor will be the applicant contracts typically forbid the distributor from registering the trademark to protect the supplier from infringement by its distribution partner patents in general patent protection in the us must be sought in conjunction with patent protection in the supplier s home country if a us patent application has not been filed within a specified period of time usually one year after the home country filing a us patent will not be available a longer period may apply under the patent cooperation treaty if the home country is a signatory assuming there is us patent protection the supplier may enforce the patent through private lawsuits in us courts against infringers both injunctive relief and damages are available remedies where the infringing goods are imported into the us an exclusion order from the international trade commission may also be sought while this procedure is faster no damage remedy is available unauthorised sale of patented products by the distribution partner is usually regulated by contract but can also be remedied through an infringement suit copyright under the us copyright act the copyright in a work of authorship including textual artistic musical and audio visual works is protected from the moment the work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression publication with a copyright notice is no longer necessary to retain us copyright protection however a supplier s ability to protect its copyrights in the us is significantly enhanced by registration with the us copyright office first registration is required before a copyright can be enforced in the us courts court decisions are currently in conflict as to whether submission of an application for registration satisfies this requirement or whether the registration must actually have been issued the us supreme court is likely to resolve this conflict in 2019 when it decides the case of fourth estate public benefit corp v wall street com llc second where a copyright has been registered before an infringer s activities began the remedies available for infringement are enhanced the plaintiff need not prove actual damages from the infringement but may elect to recover statutory damages in an amount to be set by the court or jury of up to us 150 000 per infringed work in the case of wilful infringement in addition where the copyright is registered the plaintiff may recover at the court s discretion the costs of the suit including attorneys fees trade secrets and know how see question 12 concerning protection of trade secrets as against distribution partners third parties who steal trade secrets eg by industrial espionage or hiring of key employees may be sued for theft of trade secrets under applicable state or federal law for employees mere knowledge in a particular field acquired through long experience with one employer is not a protectable trade secret that will prevent a key employee from changing jobs in such circumstances non compete agreements may give suppliers some protection but there are limits on the time frame and geographical scope technology transfer agreements technology transfer agreements are typically used to transfer technology from development organisations such as universities or government to commercial organisations for monetisation they are not commonly used to structure the relationships between commercial suppliers and their distribution partners where a licence agreement is more common consumer protection what consumer protection laws are relevant to a supplier or distributor there are many federal and state consumer protection laws that are important to suppliers and distributors well beyond what can be addressed in any detail here at the federal level these include a number of laws relating to consumer credit including the fair credit reporting act truth in lending act fair credit billing act fair debt collection practices act identity theft and assumption deterrence act of 1998 and credit accountability responsibility and disclosure act other federal consumer protection laws and regulations include the can spam act regulating the use of unsolicited commercial email ftc used car rule ftc mail or telephone order merchandise rule which covers internet and fax sales as well as telephone and mail order sales and regulates shipment times and related statements and cancellation rights ftc telemarketing sales rule under the telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act and various labelling and packaging requirements for food and beverages textiles and wool appliances alcoholic beverages and other industries to gain a sense of the range of regulations and to review ftc guidance on the subject visit the ftc website at www business ftc gov in addition most states have very broad consumer protection laws governing unfair or deceptive trade practices and specific laws governing industries such as mobile homes health clubs household storage gasoline stations and others often these provide a consumer right to rescind contracts made in certain circumstances within a defined period for example in new york there is a 72 hour right to cancel for door to door sales dating services health clubs and home improvement contracts contracts for such transactions must clearly state the right to cancel see also questions 24 and 28 regarding advertising and warranties product recalls briefly describe any legal requirements regarding recalls of distributed products may the distribution agreement delineate which party is responsible for carrying out and absorbing the cost of a recall recalls of products are regulated by a number of federal and state agencies including the food and drug administration the us department of agriculture and the consumer product safety commission in addition manufacturers importers and distributors often initiate voluntary recalls to remove a defective or dangerous product from the marketplace before it can cause harm so as to avoid the potential liability and reputational harm that can come from damage injuries or deaths it is prudent to define in the distribution contract the parties respective responsibilities in the event of a recall including who may decide to initiate a recall how it will be implemented and who will pay the costs including credits that direct and indirect customers may require for recalled products warranties to what extent may a supplier limit the warranties it provides to its distribution partners and to what extent can both limit the warranties provided to their downstream customers there are both federal and state laws regulating warranties the main federal law is the magnuson moss warranty act which applies to consumer products with a written warranty while there is no requirement that a warranty be offered if a written warranty is provided then the act requires certain disclosure of warranty terms imposes certain requirements and mandates certain remedies for consumers the act and ftc rules under it require that a written warranty be stated to be either full or limited for any consumer product that costs more than us 10 and imposes disclosure requirements for products costing more than us 15 specified information about the coverage of the warranty must be set forth in a single document in simple readily understood language and the warranties must be available where the products are sold so that consumers can read them before deciding to purchase a warranty is full only if i it does not limit the duration of implied warranties discussed below ii warranty service is provided to anyone who owns the product during the warranty period not just the first purchaser iii warranty service is provided free including costs of returning removing and reinstalling the product iv the consumer may choose either a replacement or a full refund if the product cannot be repaired after a reasonable number of attempts and v consumers are not required to do anything as a condition to obtain warranty service including returning a warranty card other than to give notice that the product needs service unless the requirement is reasonable if any of these conditions is not met then the warranty is limited rather than full the ftc requires disclosure of certain elements in every warranty including precisely what is and is not covered by the warranty when the warranty begins and ends how covered problems will be resolved and if necessary for clarity what will not be done or covered eg shipping removal or reinstallation costs consequential damage caused by a defect incidental costs incurred and a statement that the warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state any additional requirements or restrictions such as acts that will void the warranty must be disclosed the magnuson moss act prohibits a written warranty from disclaiming or modifying any warranties that are implied under applicable law as discussed further below although a limited warranty may limit the duration of implied warranties to the duration of the limited warranty subject to contrary state law a written warranty cannot be conditioned on the consumer product being used only with specific other products or services such as particular accessories but it may provide that it is voided by the use of inappropriate replacement parts or improper repairs or maintenance a waiver can be obtained from the ftc if it can be shown that a product will not work properly unless specified parts accessories or service are used the ftc the department of justice and consumers can sue to enforce the act and consumers can recover their court costs and reasonable attorneys fees if successful the act also encourages businesses to establish informal dispute resolution procedures to settle warranty disputes such procedures must meet certain requirements and must be non binding on the consumer in addition other federal laws and regulations govern such topics as warranties for consumer leases used cars and emissions control systems and advertising of warranties in almost all states warranties are governed by the uniform commercial code which provides for an express warranty an implied warranty of merchantability and an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose the implied warranty of merchantability is an implied promise whenever the product is sold by a merchant that the goods will function properly for the ordinary purposes for which they are used would pass without objection in the trade are adequately packaged and labelled and conform to any promises made in labelling or packaging the implied warranty of fitness for a particular use exists only when the seller has reason to know the purpose the buyer intends to use the product for at the time it is sold and the buyer relies on the greater knowledge and recommendation of the seller in selecting the product the extent to which implied warranties may be disclaimed varies by state where permitted disclaimers usually must be conspicuous usually interpreted as boldface capital letters similarly state law may permit sellers to limit the damages and other remedies available in case of a breach of warranty notice of such disclaimers also generally must be conspicuous many states also have specific lemon laws governing motor vehicles data transfers are there restrictions on the exchange of information between a supplier and its distribution partners about the customers and end users of their products who owns such information and what data protection or privacy regulations are applicable in contrast to many other countries federal privacy regulation in the united states is limited to a few specific areas such as children s information healthcare financial services and telecommunications the primary federal regulatory focus is on matters such as transparency to the consumer with respect to the manner in which information will be used and shared and the reasonableness of the data security protections in place the ftc and other federal agencies have adopted rules in these areas generally requiring notice to consumers about collection and use of information consumer choice with respect to the use and dissemination of information collected from or about them consumer access to information about them and appropriate steps to maintain the security and integrity of any information collected the ftc and state regulatory authorities have also been active in regulating behavioural advertising mobile apps and information security and businesses gathering customer information should familiarise themselves with the ftc s guidance in these areas until 2015 companies in the us could subscribe to the safe harbour principles agreed to between the ftc and the eu thereby bridging the gap between eu privacy principles and those of the us and permitting eu businesses to exchange personal data with their us affiliates and business partners including distribution partners the october 2015 decision of the european court of justice in the schrems case invalidated the safe harbour arrangement and called into question the ability to share data between the eu and the us in the absence of binding corporate rules standard contract clauses or some other permitted undertaking of compliance with eu data protection rules negotiations to replace the safe harbour regime led to a replacement arrangement adopted in 2016 called the eu us privacy shield which imposes more robust and detailed data protection obligations on us companies that subscribe including annual self certification to their compliance with the principles of the privacy shield the privacy shield offers eu citizens several routes to redress complaints to the company must be resolved within 45 days a no cost alternative dispute resolution mechanism will be available and complaints may be made to local european data protection authorities which will then work with the us department of commerce or ftc to make sure that complaints are investigated and resolved the future viability of the privacy shield has been seriously questioned in light of the schrems decision and a provision for annual review of the effectiveness of the privacy shield calls into question the extent to which us companies may rely on it as an alternative to the privacy shield parties to eu us distribution relationships may rely on binding corporate rules which are expressly permitted under the european union s general data protection regulation or on standard contractual clauses that have been approved by the european commission which remains a permitted mechanism to transfer personal data outside the european union at least for now in general companies collecting information about consumers must say what they will do with the collected information and do what they say within that construct and subject to the specifically regulated areas suppliers may exchange customer information with their distribution partners freely so long as adequate notice of that information exchange has been provided to consumers beyond federal law all us states and most us territories have also adopted legislation governing consumer information with data breach legislation imposing notification obligations and remedial action in the event of a security breach being the most common these state requirements sometimes conflict which can create problems a number of states impose specific security obligations on businesses that collect consumer information for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 is a comprehensive data privacy law that will impact businesses around the world that obtain use store or otherwise process the personal information of california residents including california residents who are temporarily located in other places among other things this law would provide california residents the right to know what personal information is being collected about them the right to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom and the right to say no to the sale of personal information this law is scheduled to become effective in 2020 though amendments to the law have been made since it was enacted and future amendments are likely in addition the european union s general data protection regulation gdpr which took effect in may 2018 applies to parties in the united states that i offer goods or services even for free to individuals in the european economic area and ii process personal data of individuals in the european economic area in connection with that activity the gdpr s definition of personal data is very expansive and provides that a wide range of personal identifiers eg ip addresses constitutes personal data the gdpr gives individuals in the european union greater control over their personal data and imposes many new obligations on organisations that collect handle and otherwise process personal data the gdpr also gives national data protection authorities the power to impose significant fines on organisations that fail to comply parties should clearly define in their distribution contract who owns the customer information that has been collected who has access to it who has the right to determine the purposes and means of processing of that information and the applicable confidentiality obligations which must conform to the parties respective stated privacy policies which in turn must be consistent with each other in the absence of such a definition customer data is likely to belong to the party that collected it but the sharing of such information without a statement of the recipient s obligations may result in the recipient s ability to do as it wishes with the information suppliers and their distribution partners also should cooperate in planning to prevent security breaches and to respond to them in accordance with applicable law when they occur employment issues may a supplier approve or reject the individuals who manage the distribution partner s business or terminate the relationship if not satisfied with the management under the general principle of freedom of contract the parties generally may provide as they wish with respect to supplier control over the persons who manage the distributor thus the contract can grant authority to a supplier to approve or reject the individuals who manage the distribution partner s business or the distribution of the supplier s products specifically as well as to terminate the agreement if not satisfied and again this general principle is subject to specific franchise or industry regulation as discussed in questions 8 and 9 particularly for alcoholic beverages many states have laws designed to protect the independence of wholesale distributors in such states provisions giving suppliers control over distributor management may be problematic and unenforceable and where termination is limited to statutorily defined good cause as addressed in questions 8 and 9 a right to terminate for dissatisfaction with management may be unenforceable are there circumstances under which a distributor or agent would be treated as an employee of the supplier and what are the consequences of such treatment how can a supplier protect against responsibility for potential violations of labour and employment laws by its distribution partners there is a risk that distributors especially single employee companies or sole proprietorships might be deemed employees of the supplier to prevent this it is in the supplier s interest to ensure an independent contractor relationship between itself and the distributor the tests for distinguishing bona fide independent contractors from employees vary from state to state agency to agency and statute to statute but they generally weigh various factors including does the distributor perform work for other clients and market its services to the general public or does it work exclusively for the supplier has the distributor made substantial investments in its own vehicles or other equipment or does the distributor rely on equipment of the supplier may the distributor hire its own employees to perform services for the supplier does the distributor control its schedule and how it accomplishes its work or is it subject to the supplier s instructions is the parties relationship limited in duration or open ended does the distributor have substantial skills experience and training or is supplier training required are the distributor s services similar to those of the supplier s employees does the distributor earn a profit or risk a loss on resales or receive a sales commission or other compensation for its results or is it compensated for its time eg on an hourly or salary basis does the distributor receive employee type benefits from the supplier eg vacation days sick pay health insurance no single factor is dispositive the determination is made on the totality of circumstances based on the facts of each case the distribution agreement while not dispositive should state the parties intent misclassification may result in substantial employment and tax liabilities for the supplier including retroactive pay and benefits other damages and substantial fines and penalties employees are generally entitled among other benefits to minimum wage and overtime compensation discrimination and workplace safety protections unemployment benefits workers compensation and disability insurance protected family medical and military leaves of absence and a right to participate in the employer s retirement and health plans and other benefits while there are federal employee rights specific benefits vary from state to state suppliers should engage experienced employment counsel to analyse the relevant facts and determine the proper classification there is also a risk that a supplier could be deemed a joint employer of an individual employed by a distributor rendering the supplier liable for compliance with statutory obligations to the employee such as minimum wage or overtime benefits and protection against harassment factors that are looked at to determine whether a supplier is the joint employer of a distributor s employee include i whether the supplier regularly controls the employee s schedule or workload benefits from the individual s services supervises the employee or has any overlapping owners officers or managers with the distributor and ii whether the employee is economically dependent on both the supplier and the distributor eg whether the supplier has the power to hire or fire the employee or the power to change any of the employee s terms of employment and how long the distributor s employee has performed the services for the supplier commission payments is the payment of commission to a commercial agent regulated about half the us states have laws regulating commission sales representatives these laws typically require written agreements setting forth how commission is calculated and require payment within a specified period after termination some laws provide for double or treble damages for violations a few such as puerto rico and minnesota restrict a supplier s right to terminate a sales representative without statutory good or just cause in some states sales representatives may also be protected by franchise laws in certain circumstances see questions 8 and 9 good faith and fair dealing what good faith and fair dealing requirements apply to distribution relationships a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied by the laws of most states in all commercial contracts including distribution agreements this requires the parties to deal with each other in good faith but generally does not supersede express contractual provisions thus a complaint that a supplier terminated a distribution contract in bad faith in violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing will generally not succeed in the face of a contractual provision allowing the supplier to terminate without cause indeed cases in a number of states hold that a claim cannot be based solely on a breach of the implied covenant of good faith without some breach of an express provision as well in contrast other courts have found a violation of the implied covenant of good faith where suppliers have acted to the disadvantage of their dealers notwithstanding an express provision permitting the conduct at issue for example a federal district court found that sales by the carvel ice cream company to supermarkets might violate its duty of good faith to its franchisees notwithstanding its contractually reserved right in its sole and absolute discretion to sell in the franchisees territory via the same or different distribution channels similarly some courts have found a violation of the implied covenant of good faith where the manner in which a supplier exercised its contractual rights demonstrated bad faith such as disparagement of the distributor or misappropriation of confidential customer information in connection with an otherwise permitted termination moreover some of the specific industry laws discussed in questions 8 and 9 impose an explicit obligation of good faith on suppliers and distributors that may be independently enforceable registration of agreements are there laws requiring that distribution agreements or intellectual property licence agreements be registered with or approved by any government agency with the exception of those state franchise laws that require registration of disclosure documents as discussed in question 7 and some state laws governing specific industries such as alcoholic beverages there generally are no such requirements anti corruption rules to what extent are anti bribery or anti corruption laws applicable to relationships between suppliers and their distribution partners in addition it is important that counsel for multinational businesses recognise the risks to a supplier of third party misconduct by foreign distributors and agents under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the fcpa a criminal statute prohibits bribery of foreign officials political parties and candidates for public office under the fcpa a company or individual can be held directly responsible for bribes paid by a third party if the company or individual has knowledge of the third party s misconduct for example the fcpa prohibits the giving of anything of value to any person while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing will be given directly or indirectly to bribe any foreign official foreign political party or official or to any candidate for foreign political office moreover constructive knowledge of the misconduct including wilful blindness or deliberate ignorance is enough to impose liability a defendant may be convicted under the fcpa based upon the defendant s conscious avoidance of learning about a third party s illegal business practices accordingly it is critically important to take steps to prevent such misconduct by those acting on a business s behalf including distributors agents brokers sales representatives consultants advisers and other local business partners a business with foreign business partners must exercise appropriate due diligence in selecting its partners and adequately supervise their activities it is important to consider fcpa compliance before entering into an agreement with a foreign partner through due diligence in the agreement through provisions requiring fcpa compliance and reporting and after entering into the agreement through ongoing training monitoring and audits prohibited and mandatory contractual provisions are there any other restrictions on provisions in distribution contracts or limitations on their enforceability are there any mandatory provisions are there any provisions that local law will deem included even if absent except for the specific industry regulation and franchises discussed in questions 8 and 9 and the antitrust restrictions discussed throughout this chapter the parties are generally free to structure their relationship as they wish of course distribution contracts are subject to the usual contract enforceability defences such as fraud unconscionability lack of consideration and the like as discussed in questions 26 and 31 there are certain warranties and a covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied by law laws governing specific industries and franchises may impute or require other provisions in addition if the contract gives a supplier effective control over the distributor s operations it may be held vicariously liable to third parties for the distributor s negligence or other misconduct similarly a supplier may be liable for conduct of a distributor that is required by the supplier or represented as part of the supplier s operations governing law and choice of forum choice of law are there restrictions on the parties contractual choice of a country s law to govern a distribution contract a choice of law provision in the distribution contract selecting the law of a specific state or country may be enforced if the jurisdiction chosen bears a reasonable relationship to the transaction eg the supplier s or distributor s home jurisdiction such contractual choice of law provisions while generally enforced is sometimes disregarded by courts in deference to the public policy of states with business franchise or protective industry laws of the sort discussed in questions 8 and 9 or because the validity of the contract containing the clause was questioned and courts have refused to enforce choice of law provisions that bear no reasonable relation to the parties or contract in selecting a particular state s law note that this may result in the application of either a more or less restrictive state franchise law than might otherwise be the case combining a choice of favourable law with an arbitration clause will enhance the likelihood of the choice of law being enforced the strong federal policy in favour of arbitration embodied in the federal arbitration act generally has been held to support the parties choice of law to be applied in arbitrations even in the face of explicit state law to the contrary as discussed in question 39 unless the parties provide otherwise the united nations convention on contracts for the international sales of goods will govern contracts for sales of goods between parties who have their places of business in different contracting states of which the us is one choice of forum are there restrictions on the parties contractual choice of courts or arbitration tribunals whether within or outside your jurisdiction to resolve contractual disputes the parties can provide in the distribution contract for all litigation to be brought in a court located in a particular state or country and can waive their right to seek a transfer these clauses are sometimes enforced and sometimes not the supreme court in burger king corp v rudzewicz has held that a franchisor can constitutionally enforce a forum selection clause against its franchisees in an action commenced by the franchisor in its home state courts in the distributor s home state however may refuse to enforce a forum selection clause on the ground that the public policy interests of the distributor s state outweigh the parties choice note also that state franchise laws may expressly prohibit the choice of another state as a forum federal courts however will apply federal law to determine whether to enforce such a clause notwithstanding any such state view the forum clause is not dispositive but should be considered together with the other factors normally weighed in a transfer motion at least where the choice is between two federal districts a showing of state policy sufficient to outweigh a forum clause may be difficult to make for example maryland courts have held that a forum selection clause favouring the franchisor s home state was enforceable despite being incorporated into a form contract where the franchisor had superior bargaining power reasoning that there was no fraud involved and a federal district court in new york upheld a one sided forum clause that restricted venue in actions by a franchisee but not in actions by the franchisor in contrast the district of puerto rico declined to transfer a dispute to california courts as required by a contractual forum clause as puerto rico was more convenient for witnesses and there was no evidence justifying transfer other than the contract clause as discussed in more detail in question 39 arbitration clauses specifying a particular forum are likely to be enforced under the federal arbitration act the seventh circuit us court of appeals reversed a district court decision and ordered arbitration in poland pursuant to contract in a case under the illinois beer industry fair dealing act holding that while the state s public policy expressed in that statute required illinois law to apply notwithstanding the contract s choice of polish law that public policy could not overcome the federal arbitration act policy in favour of arbitration dispute resolution procedures what courts procedures and remedies are available to suppliers and distribution partners to resolve disputes are foreign businesses restricted in their ability to make use of these courts and procedures can they expect fair treatment to what extent can a litigant require disclosure of documents or testimony from an adverse party what are the advantages and disadvantages to a foreign business of resolving disputes in your country s courts suppliers and their distribution partners have access to both state and federal courts to resolve their disputes although as noted in question 4 a company that fails to file its qualification to do business in a state in which it meets the definition of doing business usually will not be entitled to maintain any action or proceeding in the courts of the state this rule applies to both us companies formed in other states and non us companies and in general foreign businesses have equal access to the courts by and large foreign companies can expect fair treatment in us courts especially in the federal courts and courts of the larger commercial states some states such as new york have a well established body of commercial law and have created specialised commercial courts with judges experienced in commercial disputes making these courts a desirable forum for dispute resolution discovery in us courts is very broad typically requiring disclosure of documents and electronic materials responses to written interrogatories and deposition testimony of witnesses whenever material and necessary in the prosecution or defence of an action this does substantially increase the cost of litigation in us courts in response subject to showing a need for greater discovery some courts have enacted rules that place limits on the length of depositions the number of witnesses that may be deposed and the number of interrogatories that may be propounded electronic discovery of documents and email is also generally quite broad and can be a significant cost although some courts may shift that cost to the party seeking the discovery in certain circumstances in addition federal and state courts have implemented rules to permit parties to seek to limit discovery so that it is proportionate to the value of the material sought and the value of the case alternative dispute resolution methods may be agreed to by the parties such as non binding mediation or binding arbitration discussed in response to question 40 and certain industry regulations and industry self regulatory codes may provide or require certain disputes such as a claim of wrongful termination to be resolved before government agencies or industry boards alternative dispute resolution will an agreement to mediate or arbitrate disputes be enforced in your jurisdiction are there any limitations on the terms of an agreement to arbitrate what are the advantages and disadvantages for a foreign business of resolving disputes by arbitration in a dispute with a business partner in your country a provision for binding arbitration of disputes in place of the courts will generally be enforced under the federal arbitration act faa which favours arbitration agreements even in the face of state law to the contrary note however that where state law requires as some state business franchise laws do a disclosure that a choice of law or choice of forum provision including an arbitration clause may not be enforceable in that state a question arises as to whether the parties really agreed to the provision the ninth circuit us court of appeals has held that a contractual choice of forum for arbitration was unenforceable because of such a mandated disclaimer finding that the franchisee had no reasonable expectation that it had agreed to arbitrate out of state provisions limiting the relief arbitrators may award to actual compensatory damages or expressly precluding punitive damages injunctive relief or specific performance will also generally be enforceable the us supreme court has held that the faa s central purpose is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms so that the parties decision as to whether arbitrators may award punitive damages will supersede contrary state law similarly courts generally will also enforce a provision for a particular arbitration forum however care should be taken in drafting arbitration clauses not to overreach because even under the faa arbitration agreements may be set aside on the same grounds as any other contract such as fraud or unconscionability for example the ninth circuit held an arbitration clause unconscionable and so unenforceable where franchisees were required to arbitrate but the franchisor could proceed in court a district court in california rejected an arbitration clause as unconscionable where the arbitration clause blocked class adjudication requiring each case to be resolved individually and proved unfavourable for plaintiffs on a cost benefit analysis it is thus prudent to adopt a more balanced approach in drafting arbitration provisions arbitration is private in contrast to the courts and depending on the court can sometimes be faster and cheaper it may afford less discovery and can present problems requiring testimony of non parties to the disadvantage of a party who needs them there is generally no appeal from a legally incorrect or factually unfounded decision and arbitrators often seek a compromise result while there is no similar statutory underpinning for provisions requiring non binding mediation before parties may proceed to court or binding arbitration such a provision generally will be enforced under principles of freedom of contract

by the impact of decreased sales in the corn belt which are expected to be largely recovered in the second quarter synergy benefits were more than offset by higher input costs and negative currency impacts sales in crop protection decreased 5 percent with increased price of 3 percent more than offset by 2 percent lower volume and currency headwinds of 6 percent all regions outside north america delivered strong volume gains severe weather related disruptions in north america drove an overall net volume decrease of 2 percent volume gains in emea latin america and asia pacific were driven by strength in the insecticide portfolio sales in seeds decreased 15 percent volume decreased 10 percent primarily driven by weather in the corn belt delaying seed deliveries into the second quarter volume in the u s canada was also impacted by early deliveries of seed in the fourth quarter of 2018 volume increases in emea were largely driven by favorable weather leading to a strong corn season currency negatively impacted sales by 5 percent and pricing was about flat the agriculture division confirms full year guidance of operating ebitda of about 2 8 billion sales are expected to be flat with organic sales up low single digits percent the division expects to overcome the first half decline through realization of price and volume opportunities on high demand products and new product launches and accelerated cost synergy delivery resulting in an improvement in second half performance versus prior year conference call the company will host a live webcast of its first quarter

expect to complete our journey to create three leading companies in the materials science agriculture and specialty products industries from the combination of two world class organizations i am confident that each of the companies we have created is a compelling investment opportunity in their respective space with attractive financial characteristics and capital allocation policies best in

2 percent versus the year ago period volume increased 1 percent with growth in asia pacific and emea and price was flat with the year ago period currency decreased sales by 3 percent consumer solutions sales were flat with the year ago period as gains in volume and local price were offset by currency headwinds in emea and asia pacific the business reported local price and volume increases in all regions for its differentiated silicones products these gains were partially offset by year over year price declines in siloxanes intermediates coatings performance monomers reported a sales decline on lower volume local price and currency in part due to shedding of lower margin business and weather related delays to seasonal demand in the u s canada and emea regions operating ebitda was 481 million down 18 percent from operating ebitda of 586 million in the year ago period primarily due to lower prices for siloxanes and shipping restrictions from a performance monomers facility in

percent versus the year ago period volume grew 6 percent with gains in all regions local price declined 11 percent with decreases in all regions and both businesses currency decreased sales by 3 percent polyurethanes cav sales declined primarily driven by lower year over year isocyanates pricing which were partially offset by higher volumes in all regions industrial solutions reported lower sales in all regions driven by lower local price and currency headwinds in most regions the business grew volume driven by gains in emea and u s canada for industrial and oil and gas applications as well as on strong demand for de icing fluids lubricants and fuels equity affiliate losses for the segment were 48 million compared with equity affiliate income of 149 million in the year ago period the year over year decline was driven by increased equity affiliate losses from the sadara joint venture driven by margin compression in isocyanates products as well as lower margins for meg produced by the kuwait joint ventures operating ebitda was 448 million down 31 percent from operating ebitda of 654 million in the year ago period the decline in earnings was primarily due to lower equity affiliate income as well as margin compression in isocyanates products packaging specialty plastics packaging specialty plastics net sales were 5 1 billion down 15 percent versus the year ago period volume contracted 2 percent driven primarily by higher ethane feedstock usage in the united states which reduced sales of hydrocarbons energy co products local price declined 11 percent driven by reduced polyethylene product prices and lower prices for hydrocarbons energy co products currency decreased sales 2 percent the packaging and specialty plastics business grew volume on higher demand in asia pacific and emea supported by new capacity adds end market growth was led by industrial consumer packaging and flexible food specialty packaging hydrocarbons energy volume declined primarily due to increased ethylene integration from the startup of new downstream assets and higher ethane feedstock usage which led to reduced co product production equity affiliate income was 38 million compared with 59 million in the year ago period the decline was driven by lower earnings from the kuwait joint ventures due to lower polyethylene pricing and increased turnaround costs operating ebitda was 993 million down 24 percent from operating ebitda of 1 3 billion in the year ago period cost synergies increased supply from growth projects and lower commissioning and startup costs were

industrial biosciences nutrition health net volume gains were led by protein solutions and systems texturants despite sequential growth from the fourth quarter 2018 probiotics realized a year over year volume decline due to higher than average sales in the first quarter of 2018 industrial biosciences volume declines were primarily the result of ongoing challenged conditions in u s energy markets negatively impacting demand in bioactives and microbial control operating ebitda for the segment was 390 million down 7 percent from operating ebitda of 418 million in the year ago period on higher raw materials and a currency headwind which more than offset cost synergy savings transportation advanced polymers transportation advanced polymers reported net sales of 1 4 billion down 5

thanks everyone for joining us transitioning from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019 carried a degree of uncertainty due to an environment where our customers were prudently revising capex plans for 2019 resulting from pressure from shareholders to hold capex spending within operating cash flow year over year capex projections by many of our e p operator customers sets up an environment where most analysts are projecting activity declines in the high single to low double digit percentage range in the us land market on our last earnings call we guided that 1q 19 revenue would have a sequential increase in the low to mid single digit range making on modest rebound in canada and some market share gains in the permian our full year 2019 guide was flat year over year to low single digit decline in revenue for 2019 our 1q 19 revenue came in at 785 million up 21 million or 3 sequentially within our guided range for the first quarter 2019 we delivered ebitda excluding other costs of 31 million in the quarter and our gross margins improved 70 basis points year over year sequentially gross margins declined 40 basis points as the competitive environment we expected materialized one of the main contributors to sequential margin reduction is related to slowing us land activity in such an environment profit margins are more contested in addition to the macro us land backdrop commodity process in supply and demand affecting commodities have changed from the previous inflationary environment we had over the last several quarters markets have been under pressure as we got it due to better product availability in the market during this industry pause as we ve noted hot roll coil pricing continues to decline affecting welded pipe and the octg market is weakening leaving more mill capacity on the market to produce line pipe the result is downward pressure on price as the market looks to turn higher cost inventory global rig count averaged 2 262 rigs according to baker hughes sequentially flat and a 2 year over year increase our annualized revenue per rig was 1 4 million for 1q of 2019 us average rig count was down sequentially 2 to 1 046 rigs yet up year over year 8 us drilled but uncompleted wells or ducs ended with 8 500 wells in march and averaged 8 471 for 1q up 6 sequentially ducs present future revenue opportunity for dnow should the wells be completed which should drive tank battery construction and midstream gathering systems wti averaged 55 per barrel for the first quarter trending up throughout the quarter we are maintaining adherence to our four strategic areas of delivering on margin discipline maximizing our core operations leveraging our acquisitions and having a tactical approach to capital allocation with the ongoing successful execution of these strategies we can deliver on the gains our shareholders expect and we made progress in those areas in the first quarter in area of operations we continue to optimize our footprint and inventory to capitalize on market opportunities as we scale to meet market demand where we had a few small location closures in the first quarter and maintain wsa under 140 million all while growing the top line we re maintaining our focus on supporting growth in areas of high activity by allocating resources to support our customers operations as we leverage operational efficiencies with our employees processes and technology since the fourth quarter of 2018 we opened our newest regional distribution center in the permian to more efficiently organize inventory across the area and to help further optimize inventory in the permian the permian rdc investment solidifies our long term commitment to customers in the permian while providing operations with more flexibility on inventory planning order fulfillment strategies for staging and bundling as well as logistics solutions for our customers we continue to focus on opportunities to better tune our inventory across our network to increase inventory turns and reduce our overall inventory investment we further executed our human capital strategy in hot and low activity areas to strengthen our position by prioritizing recruiting and training holding recruiting events relocating key personnel and providing a safe positive work environment based on our core values of accountability doing what it takes caring about our co workers our customers and our communities beyond just providing commodity products we have been successfully delivering more value in the application of products and supply chain solutions that focus on industry applications such as tank battery hookups upgrades on existing batteries pumping solutions for midstream crude water and ngl pipelines produced water disposal gas measurement lacts vapor recovery units and modular fabricated process and production equipment we re meeting the demand for gathering systems and midstream projects comprised of pipe high yield fittings and flanges large diameter valves and actuation closures pump packages and fabricated equipment such as pig launcher and receiver modules we re exploring economical ways to expand capacity where we have choke points both organically and inorganically to grow in these areas we continue to manage product cost changes and inventory mix related to section 232 impacting steel products section 301 impacting chinese manufactured goods and components and dumping cases related to certain imported pipe fittings and flanges through our strong relationships with suppliers cost changes are integrated into our pricing and quoting process when applicable we are deploying technology to enhance our quote turnaround time customer order process fulfillment and delivery mechanisms our cross selling from acquired companies continues to add value the strong collaboration between us energy centers us supply chain services and us process solutions is resulting in pull through sales new customer introductions increased market opportunities and further market penetration as most evident in our us process solutions gains turning to our segments us revenues were 600 million up 21 million or 4 sequentially in line with expectations as the us rebounded from the holidays us energy centers contributed 52 us supply chain services 31 and us process solutions 17 of first quarter 2019 us revenue the permian continues to be the most active in areas of the delaware and midland basins with growth also in the eagle ford bakken and rockies midstream projects were active in the permian eagle ford and northeast and were a large contributor to our sequential top line growth us energy centers revenue was 314 million an increase of 2 sequentially the improved position we highlighted last quarter in the permian contributed to delivering top line growth for our us energy centers all while rig counts declined as we provided a range of valves and maintenance products followed by new tank battery builds and expansion batteries our broad range of products and services combined with our application expertise provided not only pipe valves fittings and flanges but also instrumentation electrical safety and production equipment the delaware basin continues to be a very active area with a number of our customers as we supply core mro and pipe valve and fittings products to drilling contractors oil and gas operators and midstream customers rig count within the delaware grew over the quarter with our core customers showing signs of continued robust activity in south texas we were successful in providing pvf for midstream customers for gathering and pipeline projects as well as processing facilities that have been under construction to help take away capacity from the permian to the gulf coast downstream market in the northeast our midstream launcher and receiver program for a major midstream customer continues to bear fruit as we provide repacked staged and delivery of customized pvf kits which increases our customer supply chain efficiency and streamlines their order process our employees collaboration with multiple parties including fabricators ensure material is forecasted kitted quali documents are validated and order fill rates meet agreed upon predetermined targets the mid continent area saw a sequential rig count decline for the quarter approximating 17 our line pipe business softened during the quarter as we continue to see falling pipe replacement costs and some seasonality weakness we delivered pipe to oil and gas operators for gathering projects and major midstream customers to support their pipeline expansion projects as for us supply chain services revenue was up 2 sequentially activity continued with our main scs energy customers in the permian delaware basin scoop stack eagle ford and bakken place pvf facility revenue was lighter in the quarter with one of our major operators correlated to design modifications made on new built facilities in the bakken poor weather contributed to low activity resulting in limited customer workdays during the quarter us supply chain services operator customers orders were related to steel line pipe valves flowback kits production equipment and electrical products in an effort to continually add value as a supply chain partner we secured orders for water alternating gas or wag units for the permian regarding downstream and industrial activity we executed on project and turnaround business involving pvf mill tool and safety products for major refiners and chemical manufacturing facilities for us process solutions we saw a sequential 11 million improvement of 13 the permian remain the most active region for us process solutions with the bakken rockies and eagle ford area all experiencing increased activity in the quarter our strategy to grow market share for our fabricated process and production equipment business continues as we received orders for a variety of units including but not limited to lacts motor control centers or mccs heater treaters vapor recovery towers and water injection and pipeline pump packages that were shipped to north dakota texas wyoming montana and colorado areas customers range from small to large independent e p operators as well as midstream companies which represented our largest growth customer segments sequentially for us process solutions our strategy to provide engineered pump package solutions targeted to the water management industry continues to be strong for water applications customers range from small oil and gas operators to midstream firms to stand alone water management companies furthermore i am pleased with our market penetration within the midstream pipeline booster market as a result of shipping pump packages for crude ngl and light end fluids movement for gathering lines working with our strategic vendors to plan and provide kitted pump solutions offers a unique value proposition to our midstream customers from pump packages process and production equipment as well as actuated valves from our us process solutions group turning to our canadian operations revenue decreased 2 million or 2 sequentially the market continues to contract due to production curtailment instituted by the alberta government to offset rising crude inventory levels and an attempt to narrow the price gap between western canadian select and wti oil macro challenges remain as takeaway constraints persist while political and economic challenges impact the oil and gas industry and our business in canada canadian rig count averaged 186 a year over year reduction of 87 rigs or 32 well spuds were 2 179 down 566 or 21 with only 132 operators down 47 or 26 year over year to summarize canada for the first quarter and what s normally our strongest quarter of the year we actually saw a sequential revenue decline as we had fewer rigs fewer operators and lower levels of spudding translating to lower dnow revenue finally the international segment reported first quarter revenues of 99 million up 2 million or 2 sequentially international rig count averaged to 1 030 up 2 sequentially and up 6 year over year gains were led by offshore activity in asia the uk and west africa jackup rig load outs for newbuilds continued during the quarter in asia dnow provides many of the oem and mro consumables used during drilling operations of an offshore rig where we also provide an inventory replenishment model from a nearby store base in close proximity to where the rig has been deployed middle east land activity remained steady s we provide pvf and mro consumable products locally to drilling contractors and noc and ioc oil and gas operators our uk maclean electrical group has been successful in securing and shipping electrical products tied to project activity in the middle east and former cis before moving on to discuss the outlook for the second quarter and the rest of 2019 i ll turn the call over to dave to review the financials david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks robert for the first quarter of 2019 we generated 785 million in revenue up 21 million or 3 from the same period in 2018 sequentially revenue also improved 21 million or 3 first quarter 2019 revenues landed in the range we guided to in our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call whereas oil prices then were declining in the fourth quarter beginning october at 75 and ending the year at 45 they now have improved into the low 60 range in the first quarter gross margins were 20 1 down from the 20 5 level we experienced in the fourth quarter but up 70 basis points from 19 4 a year ago the sequential decline was primarily driven by product margin pressure product mix and a resumption of inventory charges which were lower than usual in the fourth quarter of 2018 conversely the uptick in gross margin percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 can be attributed to an improved pricing position this year and more selective pricing on project quotes compared to this period last year we expect gross margins to be choppy in the near term as the market reacts to reduced activity levels and commodity price volatility as we have discussed we believe there is room for gross margin gains over time expanding generally in inflationary conditions when oil and steel pipe inflation occurs and our market resumes in a growth trajectory warehousing selling and administrative expenses or wsa was 135 million unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2018 in the first quarter we made progress resolving a long standing receivables issue with the third party resulting in the 3 million net favorable effect on wsa and operating profit paired with continued cost savings from various initiatives throughout the organization we expect wsa to approximate 140 million or lower per quarter at the activity levels in our guidance and we ll continue to take additional measures and step with changing market conditions in addition we have been systematically analyzing our supply chain footprint namely improving how effectively our network of distribution centers branches customer onsites and stocked trailers work together how cost effective they are how well they support the customer strategies and how adaptable our network is to the nomadic opportunities the industry provides given the commodity price volatility market dynamics and evolving customer requirements this view helps us shape the profile we need to grow the business and mitigate working capital and operating costs further as you know we have been diligent about fine tuning our model to improve the financial performance of the business as such when considering the locations consolidated or closed in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 the revenue generated in those locations approximated 12 million more in 1q 18 than in 1q 19 while we did retain some of this revenue by servicing activity from our locations we were able to move resources to fund growth elsewhere this remains a mantra for dnow grow the business while demand improved operating efficiencies and working capital velocity while many positive things are happening across dnow one area we ve seen notable gains is in our downstream industrial group this group has implemented a high grading regiment by focusing on higher margin opportunities and product lines and meaningfully improving operating efficiencies while turning their working capital even faster all employees of dnow in addition to our shareholders have benefited from the focus and hard work of this team operating profit was 23 million or 2 9 of revenue an improvement of 16 million year over year net income for the first quarter was 18 million or 0 16 per diluted share an improvement of 0 14 when compared to the corresponding period of 2018 on a non gaap basis ebidta excluding other costs was 31 million or 3 9 of revenue for the first quarter of 2019 an improvement of 15 million versus the first quarter of 2018 net income excluding other costs was 13 million or 0 12 per diluted share other costs after tax for the quarter included the benefits of approximately 5 million from changes in our valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets offset by less than 1 million in severance expenses after tax in the period our effective tax rate as reported for gaap purposes was 6 5 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 24 1 a year ago the change in the effective tax rate when compared to the corresponding period in 2018 was primarily driven by increases in pre tax income in 2019 cash totaled 87 million in march 31 with 76 million located outside the us approximately 60 of which is in canada and the uk historically it s been our practice and intention to reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in light of the significant changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act we previously discussed we are no longer permanently reinvested with regard to our pre 2018 canada and uk earnings we now are able to repatriate excess cash from both canada and the uk to the us providing additional treasury flexibility including repayment of amounts borrowed under our credit facility during the first quarter of 2019 we repatriated 20 million from our canadian operations moving to our segments us revenues were 600 million a 7 improvement from the first quarter of last year on an increase in us rig activity canadian revenues were 86 million down 16 year over year going up in negative impact of foreign exchange in canada the revenue decline would have been 11 amid a 32 decline in canadian rig count and internationally revenues were 99 million in the first quarter of 2019 essentially flat with a year ago after excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange international revenue would have increased 3 from 1q 18 to 1q 19 moving on to operating profit the us generated operating profit of 19 million or 3 2 of revenue an improvement of 16 million when compared to the corresponding period of 2018 primarily due to revenue increases and improved pricing canada operating profit was 2 million or down 2 million when compared to the corresponding period of 2018 as a result of the revenue decline mentioned earlier international operating profit was 2 million or up 2 million when compared to 1q 18 driven by reduced bad debt charges turning to the balance sheet cash totaled 87 million at march 31 and we ended the quarter with 124 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility and a net debt position of 37 million when considering total company cash at march 31 2019 our total liquidity from our credit facility availability plus cash on hand was 531 million our debt to capital ratio was 9 at march 31 or 3 when considered on a net debt basis working capital excluding cash as a percent of revenue for the first quarter was of 2019 was 22 accounts receivable were 513 million at the end of the first quarter up 31 million sequentially on higher sales yielding 60 day dsos first quarter inventory levels were 634 million and inventory turn rates remained steady at 4 0 turns accounts payable were 339 million at the end of the first quarter with days payable outstanding at 49 days net cash used in operating activities was 20 million for the first quarter with negligible capital expenditures this quarter we adopted fasb s new standard for accounting for leases which requires us to move operating leases onto the balance sheet you will see these added assets and liabilities included in our financial statements in the quarter with the impact of adopting this standard on our income statement and cash flow being immaterial we are a working capital intensive business our employees are focused on providing value added products and supply chain solutions by outdelivering and outsourcing the competition while finding ways to meaningfully speed up collections and reduce purchase quantities and safety stock values and aspirations enabled in the static atmosphere so that we can generate higher levels of free cash flow in 2019 and now i ll turn the call back to robert robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks dave let s wrap up with the outlook for the second quarter and the rest of 2019 looking forward in the us wti is trending above its 4q 18 average as us rig count has declined of its december peak us completions have risen from december while the average duc inventory continues to build the most recent report from the eia showed a modest net duc reduction in march even if rig counts decline modestly or remain flattish and if customer budgets shift more toward completions to draw down more on duc inventory this could benefit our us process solutions business for modular rotating production measurement and process equipment this would also benefit our us supply chain services and us energy centers demand for pipe valves and fittings especially as it applies to midstream projects that would be required to get oil gas and water to their final destinations our outlook for the us energy centers remains positive with high activity areas such as the permian eagle ford rockies and bakken leading softer areas such as the mid continent and northeast two of our larger us supply chain services operator customers announced they plan to reduce capex spend approximately 10 this year one stated by the midpoint of 2019 and the other on a year over year basis this will put downward pressure on our us supply chain services revenue for the remainder of the year in canada where political turmoil and takeaway issues persist for which there aren t any solutions in sight the rest of 2019 will be challenging and we expect declines there canada will experience break up as the freeze thaw cycle has historically reduced our canadian revenues by approximately 25 sequentially alberta s recent election results and investment in transportation by rail provide some optimism for the rest of the year however we are cautious about our canadian operations due to all of the uncertainties looking ahead internationally we are eager to see more jack up and floater tenders materializing continue to increase in offshore activity in europe brazil and mexico an uptick in land based activity in australia and budgetary quoting activity tied to some lng projects beyond this we have some bright spots with a specific offshore drilling contractor in asia and other projects in the middle east which could enable growth in our international business recent and planned fid approvals in offshore rig contract announcements indicate that worldwide offshore markets are poised for long term recovery and that could produce more than just marginal top line improvements for our international segment in 2020 and beyond as customers work through inventories and move from exploratory to development activities given these scenarios and recognizing the opaque view we have into customers second half 2019 budgetary plans we reaffirm our guidance for the full year to be flat revenues to a low single digit decline and expect 2q 19 revenue to be flat to low single digit decline from 1q 19 we will continue to focus on maximizing gross margins in a choppy but stabilizing price environment we will work to improve our working capital terms and generate positive free cash flow before i move on to recognize one of our dedicated employees i d like to summarize the progress we made in the execution of our strategy we continue to focus on margin discipline identifying opportunities for enhancement in areas related to our quotation process as well as pricing improving our operational efficiencies optimizing our inventory and our sourcing strategy in responses to import tariffs on steel products and leveraging our previous acquisitions through enhanced cross selling of products in bundled product and service offerings we re adjusting our footprint in our supply chain focusing on our central and regional distribution centers inventory strategy optimizing our human capital leveraging technology to enhance our replenishment settings and partnering with our preferred suppliers to grow market share we approach to capital allocation with discipline by leveraging our inventory investment managing our working capital as a percent of sales with an increase in revenue and maintaining a healthy balance sheet which provides optionality in the event that one of the many companies we d like to add to our differentiated product and service offerings becomes viable with the further successful execution of our strategy we expect continued improvement toward generating free cash flow paying down our already low level of debt and creating greater shareholder value with that let me recognize one of our employees whose daily hard work and dedication enable us to deliver on our promises 44 years ago ed merritt started his career as a warehouseman for the oilwell division of us steel in houston texas in less than a year ed was promoted to storeman and in 1981 ed moved to the purchasing area as a buyer associate followed by move to the front lines as a sales service representative in 1987 after spending several years in sales leadership roles in 1998 ed became an mro coordinator and eventually moved into customer contracts for the distribution services group at national oilwell today ed works as a pricing coordinator where he works closely with sales operations and material sourcing to help drive value for our customers one of ed s claims to fame within close circles of our drilling customer community was winning a branding competition for our customer vendor managed inventory solution for land based rigs also our drilling contractor customers and employees know it today as rig pack over the span of 44 years it would be natural to have a few nicknames thrown at you to see what it sticks for ed two words rise to the top as his co workers colleagues and customers refer to him as steady eddie a nickname that captures ed s pride in his work his commitment and attention to detail ed has had a lifelong passion for horticulture and tends to his own orchard at his home in magnolia just north of houston if you re looking to win a contest or find yourself in a chair wanting to be a millionaire and need to phone a friend who can name any tree plant or flower give steady eddie a call ed thanks for your 44 years of service your customer focus and for doing it the right way now let me turn the call over to richard to start taking your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from david manthey from baird please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey david david manthey robert w baird analyst hey good morning robert and dave robert r workman president and chief executive officer hi david david manthey robert w baird analyst hey dave quick question for you last quarter you had some bad debt recoveries that offset wsa and you said that it would have been 140 million plus if not for those and this quarter you have these lower bad debt charges which i assume are lower accruals to a reserve account the question is is that a one time adjustment or should we expect to sustainably lower accrual there and i guess bottom line is 135 million more representatives going forward or are the 140 million level david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer so in answering your first question we had a 3 million net gain with the third party which is something we ve been working on for probably six years so that benefit you won t see that in future quarters so while we posted wsa at 135 million it s easily 138 million we are seeing more efficiencies lower medical costs this year in the business so we re hoping to bring that number down you know i talked about in my comments we expect wsa to be 140 million or lower right now it s looking like like something in that 138 million 140 million range and we d like to leave a little cushion there in case there in case things percolate and things might get stronger but that s kind of where we re at david manthey robert w baird analyst okay so the 4 million is more a representation of a something that you recaptured as opposed to a sustainably lower accrual based on better experience david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer exactly dave david manthey robert w baird analyst all right thank you david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator and thank you our next question from the line comes from james west from evercore isi please go ahead james west evercore isi analyst good morning guys robert r workman president and chief executive officer good morning james west evercore isi analyst so robert i think the part of your business the offshore part of your business has been well is it bluntly decimated during the downturn here i believe it went from a and these are rough ballpark numbers probably a 250 million a year business to maybe 75 million at the bottom but with the offshore rigs going back to work now i would think that they need to restock that they probably are understocked on equipment spares etc i would think there would be a pretty big opportunity for you guys how do you see that unfold i know you just did a big whirlwind tour and met with many of the offshore operators during that tour so what are they saying and how do you see that opportunity going forward robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so the number you suggested as far as our peak was a full year number and it s dropped off quite considerably through all those rig stockings and everything s going so the reason i don t expect much recovery in that market for us until 2020 ish is because as you know there s about 30 or 40 more at least offshore rigs to be scrapped and they will scrap them as they re putting other rigs to work you know how that works and so they will put that inventory to shore base and they ll start feeding the rigs that are either getting constructed or out there working so for us it s such a huge lag before it affects us especially when we just went through an offshore decline like the one that s never happened before like the one we just went through where there s so much spare inventory out there they ll be burning through their own capital for quite some time so while it will be while it will grow i think our offshore revenue with both oil and gas companies and drillers bottomed in 2q of last year it s improving modestly and it sometimes it s double digit growth but don t forget it s coming off of a really low base james west evercore isi analyst okay okay fair enough and then as you think about the us land market this year even the independents are going to be holding the line within budget which is down a little bit year over year privates likely to respond to the oil price move that we ve had and then you have these two major oil companies announced very ambitious plans and so how does your customer mix stack up against that planning cycle and that budget cycle and do you have could you be conservative i guess in your kind of forecasting for us land it s in fact the major oil companies do what said they re going to do robert r workman president and chief executive officer while the difference between the major oil companies and what i d say the medium to small independents is the major oil companies typically partner pretty strongly with a supply chain provider and some of those majors are some of our largest customers so it could benefit us the lot major is the one that goes to work the part that gives me some concern is our biggest customers our supply chain oil and gas companies and most of those people listen to their earnings call so far this season are toeing the line on their budgets i mean one of them reported earlier this week and he must have said 10 times on the call we are living with our cash flow we re living with our cash flow our capex budget won t go up i don t care where oil goes we re not going to increase our capex budget so there s so many dynamics involved in that that it s really hard at this point to figure out because even some of our big customers that have reported so far have announced they overspent budgets in 1q and then said but we won t overspend this year which leads me to believe that their spend for the next several quarters would be lower than 1q so if you ve got the answer to what our customers are going to spend in the second half of this year i ve got a plane ticket for you to come and entertain us james west evercore isi analyst great all right great thanks guys robert r workman president and chief executive officer no problem david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question from the line comes from marc bianchi from cowen please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hi marc marc bianchi cowen and company analyst hey good morning thank you i guess i m curious to talk a little bit more about the gross margin commentary that you have here you guys have been saying for a few quarters choppy and it has this quarter i m just curious what do you think is the range when you say choppy as we look out over the next couple of quarters and how do you see this octg weakness that you alluded to kind of impacting that as we roll through the next couple david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer okay so we ve talked about gross margins declining for about three quarters now and they held strong through the end of the fourth quarter and had record gross margins of 20 5 so this was the decline we had anticipated for some time but somehow we were able to maintain growth in gross margin several quarters in a row i think we had four quarters in a row over 20 what that range is i don t think we re really sure i mean i think with the 20 1 this quarter it could it s going to vary in these coming quarters but we don t expect major drops in gross margin i think it feels like pricing may have stabilized that s going to depend on what happens in the market if we see things slowing down there will be downward pressure on gross margins if things start to if we start to percolate in the second half we ll see some lift there that s generally kind of how it s going to behave but getting specific about the number it s really hard to tell robert r workman president and chief executive officer and regarding the question you asked about octg we don t really distribute octg but when the mills are rolling still they prefer to make octg over everything else because that s where they make most of their profits so whenever they re really busy making tubing and casing it s really hard to get a slot in the plant for us to get line pipe replenishment orders and they would charge they would charge a premium for that pipe because we are convincing them to stop rolling where they make most of their profit when it slows down and the octg is not filling up the mill they may they re more open to roll in line pipe and they re also more open to cutting better pricing arrangements with their suppliers because they need the volume so that s really how the octg affects all of our line pipe marc bianchi cowen and company analyst so robert to clarify on that your point is that the if octg prices are down there becomes more capacity for line pipe which could perhaps help your gross margin is that really the point you guys are trying to make here robert r workman president and chief executive officer no it s what it does is it creates a deflationary period for line pipe our moving average costs in our system for a line pipe would be higher than what the replacement cost is marc bianchi cowen and company analyst yes okay and then just to and really a follow up you guys have been focused on the working capital line down here and really executing on that as best you can we noticed in the proxy you guys increased the weighting of that metric in the annual comp which i think investors will applaud but could you kind of talk about what the targets are there and how you see that unfolding over the balance of the year david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer okay so working capital right now is 22 we ve had that a bit lower than that we want to go lower aspirationally we ve talked about this we d like to get down to 20 now we re in a period where customers are trying to live within budget everyone s trying to maximize cash retention so our dso suffered a little bit in the quarter customers are holding on to cash the real opportunity in addition to working closer with our customers get paid faster is to turn our inventory better we re a literally encouraged by although we had a use of cash in the first quarter of 20 million it s better than the use of cash last year which was 31 million in the first quarter so we want the kind of quarters to behave similarly in 2019 like it did in 18 and we believe we can turn in our working capital faster and get to more free cash flow in 2019 than 2018 but that s kind of our target and that s what we re shooting for we re in a kind of a sideways environment and it s harder to get them in this space marc bianchi cowen and company analyst got it thank you very much robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks marc operator thank you our next question from the line comes from steve barger from keybanc capital markets please go ahead steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys robert r workman president and chief executive officer morning steve david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer hi steve steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst so i hear you on customers wanting to stay within budget or cash flow but don t you view that as an opportunity to some degree as a lot of your offerings are focused on lowering costs or are just making operations more efficient and how have you pushed the company to respond to the environment robert r workman president and chief executive officer the answer the long answer to your first question is yes the answer to your second question is that you re seeing some of that materialize in our business right now so the two groups that would mainly be able to impact that for customers would be either the process group or the splotching group and splotching group you d basically you have to win a customer and that would be a big event it wouldn t be just incremental the process group is growing for that reason so that s one of the big drivers because we can start pre module arising the entire tank battery while the drilling is going on and so while the drilling is going on and then the frac job is going on we actually could have finished the entire tank battery and then it s all modular and so when the frac crew leaves the well site we can show up with our stuff our kit drop it down it takes minimal time to plug all the stuff together so where a normal tank battery might take 45 to 60 or longer days to visit how many wells are on the pad we can have all of our modules onsite plumed in and producing and cleaning gas oil and water and measuring it and put it in pipelines in three days five days seven days so it s cheaper for the customer because believe it or not the modules that are made in our asme shops and all of our iso shops are high quality the net net cost is lower just straight up what it cost to fabricate it because you don t have a bunch of crews on site with torches and welders and grinders and customers get cash flow quicker because instead of waiting you know 60 to 90 days to get cash flow they get cash flow in short order so that is one of the reasons why we re selling this skid right now to customers who have typically not been our customers because they see the value steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst yes i mean and we ve talked about this before it seems like that solution just should sell itself so what is the pushback if any that you get when you re out offering that to new customers robert r workman president and chief executive officer it s something that most customers haven t experienced before in fact most customers say to us they re like i didn t even know you could do this stuff so we have to sell them on that then you got to get them into the shops then you have to send your quality people into go through our shops and make sure we meet their quality standards but literally most customers didn t know it existed and that was usually the pushback that we got but now right now we re seeing kind of an acceleration of that our biggest issue right now is if you think about these solutions you might have one shop that s fabricating all the skids and then nose feed other shops like the skid shop will feed the lact unit shop it will feed the oil and gas water separator shop it ll feed the multiplex water injection pump package shop so everybody s waiting on their skids to go to shop so they can finish the work another one of our shops that feeds all the other shops is our vessel shop and that s where we make the asme vessels that are used for all sorts of stuff all across they re on the lact units they re on the water injector pump packages they are on the gas part of the gas oil water seperators or the heater treaters all that stuff is waiting on a vessel to come to their shops so they can complete their package that s my choke point right now so that s what i mentioned on the call where we re trying to find inorganic or organic ways to solve that choke point quickly steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst and are you making progress on that front have you found a way to open up some capacity there robert r workman president and chief executive officer i think so yes i believe we have a solution that it will happen in short order steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst and just holding the product pricing conversation constant if you re successful in selling these value added solutions isn t that positive for gross margin over time in itself robert r workman president and chief executive officer it is there s no question about that it would be positive for gross margin over time the one thing that works against us is the huge behemoth that s called the energy centers it takes a lot of positive to move that ship upward steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst right right and i think i missed this but you ve made some comments about one specific downstream team that was really outperforming on inventory turns or margin could any more detail on that and is that something whatever they re doing that you can spread across the platform david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i do think we re doing that across the platform but the leadership there has been particularly focused on improving their business in a meaningful way and we ve seen real positive results there that stuff s happening across the organization but when we looked at year over year most improved that was one of the areas where that happened steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst okay and just one last one for me alberta announced their rail car deal in late february i think they expect to start shipments in july do the customers up there believe that s happening at that pace and what s the real benefit to you when those trains start transporting oil robert r workman president and chief executive officer well the issue with canada went from an operator perspective of oil and gas company perspective is they just need to know that something is going to solve the problem so you know even if somebody announce that ok if d c agreed to alberta yes you can build that pipeline to go to our coast even if that pipeline would take a year and half to two years to build just knowing it s going to get done would spur activity so if there s evidence that shows up that the rail solution is actually going to solve some of the problem i think you would see increased activity but it s but don t forget shipping the oil by rail is a lot more expensive than shipping it by pipeline so the differential between what the oil and gas operator earns after paying to get that product all the way to the gulf coast is still not inspiring it s just a lot better than what we are today steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst right still better than being stranded robert r workman president and chief executive officer exactly steve barger keybanc capital markets analyst got it thanks for the time robert r workman president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you our next question online comes from vebs vaishnav from howard weil please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hi vebs vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst hey good morning how you doing robert r workman president and chief executive officer good vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst i guess i just want to make sure i heard correctly the response to i think marc s question about gross margins did dave mean gross margins are going to be down sequentially or i just didn t want to put words in your mouth i want to make sure i got it correctly though david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer no i don t know that to be the case what i said is we had said for some time we expected we saw our gross margins grow quarter after quarter we saw records in the fourth quarter we expected declines few quarters ago and they occurred in the first quarter what happens from here we re not sure robert r workman president and chief executive officer and vebs the reason why it s hard to forecast that is we re not dealing with some simple way to forecast margins we did millions and millions and millions of transactions like a left and right and so all of that has to settle out so we can see where the margins are headed so it s a really difficult thing to predict david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i don t think the variability is going to be wide but it s going to vary and we might so i ll just leave it at there i think it s going to be a little choppy as we ve been forecasting robert r workman president and chief executive officer i mean if it was down a little bit in this quarter or flat or up a little bit none of those would surprise me vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst got it okay just year over year if i think about like international piece of the business everybody has been talking about mid to high single digit international growth is that a good ballpark to think about overall 2019 robert r workman president and chief executive officer no not for us so if you think about the process you go through when international activity picks up so once an oil and gas company agrees that they re going to hire drill ship and they re going to go out and drill some exploratory wells and then to determine later if we re going to go to development the people that get that revenue first are the drillers and the people that build the subsea equipment and things of that nature it doesn t materialize in my p l until that development work is done yes i ll say the rigs and stuff but what i really need is to go and development when the oil and gas company and there s more than one rig out there start buying a product from us mro products and things of that nature pipe valves and fittings and so that s why i ve said i think i ve been saying three years in a row i didn t expect a material improvement in our international segment until 2020 or beyond vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst okay and just thinking about canada obviously down 16 year over year but there was some fx related issues is 10 to 15 down year over year canada a good ballpark david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer yes probably is i mean we were down 11 in the first quarter if you take out the fx effect so in us dollars it could be in that range vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst okay and just last question for me on tank battery i think like you guys had announced like a one kit full kit ordered last quarter just any uptake any more orders for the full tank battery robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so that particular customer was the first one that gave us a shot at delivering what i just reviewed earlier with james west in his question or not james with the others barger on this question so we delivered that complete turnkey battery they wanted to test us they really liked it and they ve ordered several more since then so i m hoping as other customers find out that this is working for this particular customer that it ll begin to become a more and more accepted solution as opposed to what we ve done it for last 50 years vaibhav vaishnav scotia howard weil analyst all right that s very helpful thank you for taking my questions robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks vebs operator our next question on line comes from nathan jones from stifel please go ahead robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey nathan adam farley stifel analyst good morning this is adam farley on for nathan robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey is he down in australia vacationing adam farley stifel analyst it s a busy morning for us hey just turning back to us process solutions you guys called out pretty strong deliveries of produced water packages and some of the future drivers in this like midstream water space so i was wondering maybe you could like size that opportunity or at least provide some color on a high level does midstream water gaining more importance from an e p capital spend robert r workman president and chief executive officer well it is and it s not just the e p folks there are some midstream companies that are in and some pure water companies now the cost of pump packages we sell into that market are generally some of the lower revenue packages because they re just ansi centrifugal pumps generally what s one of the exciting piece is we ve already got some orders lately from some large midstream companies is once you get all that water to one spot which uses the small lower cost packages once you ve treated this water you either have to recycle it which still uses more of these low cost pump packages or you got to reinject it back down in the formation and that s where the big pump packages come in so we were successful last quarter and getting a nice order and for a large midstream company that will take i don t know five six quarters to deliver the whole thing so it s so pretty positive stuff happening in that space in fact the supplier of this big high pressure expensive pumps is one of our partners and they actually mentioned of the order on their earnings call adam farley stifel analyst that s good to hear and then just turning to m a maybe just give an update on the space valuations where you guys are at how is your pipeline what geographies any color there would be great robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so it s now moved from a seller s market to a buyer s market obviously it s that s why almost all of our deals are usually done in a questionable period of market activity and the inbounds are definitely higher than they were the last 18 months and we ve always got deals that we re looking at that s in our that we re constantly negotiating but we just haven t closed any because we re not willing to we re trying to be conservative with how we value these businesses so we re just we never could get up with a bid at spread things look a little bit better right now so we hope something will translate into success in that arena and the good news is we have a super clean balance sheet so we won t have any concerns around leverage or anything like that adam farley stifel analyst and is that are there certain geographies that you re looking at or maybe add something to like a bolt on onto us process solutions or any ideas there robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so our stated strategy around the m a is for anything that we need to do in canada or the us for our energy center business or our us supply chain services business is going to be organic generally unless some deal comes along that we just can t turn down so they can have access to the balance sheet as they come up with great ways to grow their business organically and we will fund that for them if we do anything else in the us it would more than likely be us process solutions and then outside of the us and canada we re kind of open to anything that we do this core whether it s process equipment supply chain investment or in the energy center brands because we re now in some 20 some odd countries that have all their own corporate offices because you have to have them in all these countries so you have all this overhead and so if you can acquire companies that are part of our core service and product offering and tuck them up under that corporate office you can get some pretty nice flow throughs on that stuff so generally that s kind of our planned approach to capital allocation as it applies to acquisitions adam farley stifel analyst all right great thank you robert r workman president and chief executive officer you re welcome david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from sean meakim from jpmorgan robert r workman president and chief executive officer hey sean sean meakim jpmorgan analyst good morning david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning sean meakim jpmorgan analyst so i was hoping we could get some more detail around the midstream it seems like it s becoming a little more prominent in your messaging to the market to what extent did that did some of your working capital build relate to what s going to be probably a pretty busy construction season in 2q and 3q and then long term how do you think about and i recognize that and we ve talked about in the past and to some degree you may not as explicitly distinguish up versus midstream but how do we think about the long term potential of that end market in terms of projects the next couple of years versus long term maintenance and more steady work robert r workman president and chief executive officer yes so we ve always been in the market obviously but what we ve experienced as of late which was part of the original plan is we now have access to things that we didn t before that are part of the entire project so for example i m talking about our process solutions group we never had lact units before that s what measure oil when it goes into pipeline we never had the gas measurement systems we never had the vapor recovery units all these stuff that a midstream customer were used to go to us or our competitors to get all the pipe valves and fittings then they would go to another supplier to get all the equipment that goes in like pig launcher receivers and things like that now if we can get upfront with the actual equipment that they re going to use on these pipelines we can typically cross sell all of the material that s needed to construct or put this material into the pipeline so we re seeing a lot of success on cross selling between us supply chain services and us energy centers by them to coordinate with our us process group to bring in a bigger package and offering the end user a better economic opportunity to bundle the whole thing so that s why we re seeing some success in our midstream market greater than normal and that also includes the fact that when we got process solutions before we didn t have the ability to do valve modification and things like that we had to outsource that work now we re doing all that in house so we re getting nice valve and valve actuation orders because we have the ability to turn down a ring joint to erase space or whatever as opposed to waiting on valve deliveries of 38 and 40 and 45 weeks so all that stuff coupled together and the teams working together is what s kind of spurred this nice growth for our midstream customers and literally we have all sorts of businesses we got all sorts of markets whether that s downstream or midstream or upstream or artificial lift or electrical or whatever i really expected 1q to be down where you guys forecasted because we had a decline in completions in 4q and there s a lag and so i expected the completion decline in 4q to translate into revenue declines in 1q fully expected it what happened is that actually happened revenue tied to completions went down our midstream growth offset it sean meakim jpmorgan analyst very interesting yes makes a lot of sense and i guess it d be good to get an update in terms of where we are on your inventory you ve had tariffs coming in last year we had some inflation running through the system at various points that was a net benefit for the distributors so where do we stand today in terms of where your inventory stands versus where spot is across pipe is another kind of key sensitive product lines it d be great to get a sense of where we stand on that and the look forward david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer well what i would say in terms of inventory sean is obviously the period of strong inflation as we went through a period of deflation for a couple of years and then finally we got a nice pump for several quarters mostly driven by steel punctuated by pipe that period is over we re starting to see some pullback in pricing on welded pipe in particular and seamless pipe otherwise where replacement cost is getting close to our inventory costs and in some cases lower so that s kind of leading the downward movement in margins for us in the first quarter so we re trying to manage our inventory to mitigate the effects of that change in pipe costs but i think that ll stabilize once we burn off that inventory sean meakim jpmorgan analyst got it okay thank you for that appreciate it robert r workman president and chief executive officer thanks sean david a cherechinsky senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our time for the question and answer session let me now turn the call

the financial performance and condition of the company these measures which the company believes are widely used by investors securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the company

construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with ifrs non ifrs measures include adjusted net income adjusted net earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis adjusted operating income and adjusted ebitda rob wildeboer executive chairman stated it is great to see 2019 off to a great start of what we believe will be another record year for martinrea we believe that our story in 2019 and 2020 will be a very good one on both an absolute and relative basis we are seeing some softness in automotive markets and are doing well overall despite the headwinds our north american segment has done extremely well year to date despite some reduction in overall market volumes the north american economy continues to perform positively and the trade and tariff issues that we still face in our industry have had some negative effect but limited in scope and severity our european segment saw steady sales and operating income year over year during the quarter but there has been softness there in overall volumes and in the volumes of some key customers whether caused by the brexit uncertainty or the uncertain regulatory environment we do see some continuing softness there our rest of the world segment while a very small part of our business has had some major volume challenges some regional and some with the volumes of our customers in the regions being china and brazil resulting in reduced sales and losses for the segment our fluids plant in china and our aluminum brazilian operations in particular have been negatively impacted by these volume headwinds as such we are currently contemplating downsizing these facilities to keep costs in line with sales and ultimately improving our competitiveness in these sometimes difficult markets we are also seeing some supplier stress in the overall market making some assets available i am pleased to report that we recently acquired a small plant in mississippi from variform at a very attractive price along with the related work for nissan we will buy assets when the values are compelling results of operations all amounts in this press release are in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated and all

free cash flow impact of the adoption of ifrs 16 leases effective january 1 2019 the company adopted the new accounting standard ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 in adopting the new standard the company used the modified retrospective approach which involves recognizing transitional adjustments in opening retained earnings if any on the date of initial application without restating comparative prior periods as such 2018 prior year comparatives have not been restated the adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of lease liabilities of 228 6 million and right of use assets of 223 8 million net of accrued liabilities related to the leases of 4 8 million recognized as at january 1 2019 in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet from an earnings perspective while timing differences may exist the new standard results in a decrease in operating rent expense essentially replaced by increases in finance and depreciation expenses as recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations as such the adoption of ifrs 16 did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results and the financial metrics for the quarter ended march 31 2019 outlined above other than adjusted ebitda the adoption of ifrs 16 contributed approximately 7 of the year over year growth in adjusted ebitda due to the recognition of depreciation expense on right of use assets in lieu of operating rent expense as required by the new standard the adoption of the new standard is further explained in recently adopted and applicable accounting standards and policies

023 2 million as compared to 963 9 million for the first quarter of 2018 the total increase in sales was driven by year over year increases in the north america and europe operating segments partially offset by a decrease in the rest of the world sales for the first quarter of 2019 in the company s north america operating segment increased by 70 0 million or 9 4 to 811 1 million from 741 2 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increase was due to the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 including the next generation gm silverado sierra ram pick up trucks and the new chevrolet blazer the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of u s denominated production sales which had a positive impact on overall sales for the first quarter of 2019 of approximately 35 0 million as compared to the first quarter of 2018 and an increase in tooling sales of 20 7 million which are typically dependant on the timing of tooling construction and final acceptance by the customer these positive factors were partially offset by lower year over year production volumes on certain light vehicle platforms including the ford escape and jeep wrangler and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 sales for the first quarter of 2019 in the company s europe operating segment increased by 4 7 million or 2 5 to 190 4 million from 185 7 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increase can be attributed to the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 including a 2 0l aluminum engine block for ford and a 9 4 million increase in tooling sales these positive factors were partially offset by lower year over year production volumes on certain jaguar land rover platforms and a 1 3 million negative foreign exchange impact from the translation of euro denominated production sales as compared to the first quarter of 2018 sales for the first quarter of 2019 in the company s rest of the world operating segment decreased by 17 0 million or 42 2 to 23 3 million from 40 4 million in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was due to a lower year over year production volumes on the ford mondeo and cadillac ct6 vehicle platforms in china lower year over year production sales in the company s facility in brazil a 5 4 million decrease in tooling sales and a 1 0 million negative foreign exchange impact from the translation of foreign denominated production sales as compared to the first quarter of 2018 these negative factors were partially offset by the ramp up of new aluminum structural components work for jaguar land rover in china which began to ramp up in the first quarter of 2018 but at significantly lower than expected volumes overall tooling sales increased by 24 7 million or 34 7 to 95 9 million for the first quarter of 2019 from 71 2 million for the first quarter of 2018 gross margin three months ended march 31 2019 to three months ended march 31 2018

of 2019 of 15 4 increased as a percentage of sales by 0 4 as compared to the gross margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018 of 15 0 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was generally due to productivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities and general sales mix including new and replacement programs that launched and old programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 these positive factors were partially offset by operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain other facilities including upfront costs incurred in preparation of upcoming new programs and related to new business in the process of being launched and an increase in tooling sales which typically earn low margins for the company

share on a basic and diluted basis for the first quarter of 2018 despite the year over year decrease in adjusted net income adjusted net earnings per share is up year over year due to the lower outstanding martinrea share count as a result of the recent share repurchases the company completed under a normal course issuer bid as further explained in note 12 of the financial statements and later on in the md a under disclosure of outstanding share data adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted by the following operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain other facilities including upfront costs incurred in preparation of upcoming new programs and related to new business in the process of being launched a year over year increase in research and development costs due to increased new product and process research and development activity a year over year increase in sg a expense a year over year increase in depreciation expense due to the adoption of ifrs 16 a year over year increase in finance expense on the company s revolving bank debt and equipment loans as a result of increased debt levels and borrowing rates and interest on lease liabilities as a result of the adoption of ifrs 16 a net unrealized foreign exchange gain of 0 5 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to a net unrealized foreign exchange gain of 2 7 million for the first quarter of 2018 and a higher effective tax rate on adjusted income due generally to the mix of earnings 24 9 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 24 2 for the first quarter of 2018 these factors were partially offset by the following higher gross profit on increased year over year sales as previously explained productivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities general sales mix including new and replacement programs that launched and old programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 and lower operating rent expense due to the adoption of ifrs 16 generally replaced by increases in finance and depreciation expenses dividend a cash dividend of 0 045 per share has

expansion was driven by additional scale and efficiencies in our cloud and support businesses as well as product mix our cloud margin expanded 160 basis points year over year as we look longer term

million to date our capital allocation strategy continues to target returning 20 of our trailing 12 months operating cash flows to shareholders via our dividend program please note that going forward we planned a more naturally align our annual dividend review with our annual results burning call so that means our next annual dividend review will be during our q4 fiscal 2020 call not during our q3 fiscal 2020 earnings call we will remind everyone as we get closer to the date we think that alignment to our annual calendar is a better way to do a dividend review the opentextâ s leadership team is world class they executed very well within the quarter while also onboarding liaison and catalyst and to know both acquisitions are on target to be on the operating opentext operating model can be fully integrated within the first 12 months has also been eight quarters since we acquired the ecd documentum division from dell emc let s reflect on our incredible progress we re now number one in

and our information platform canada is among the top 10 economies of the world 1 8 trillion in annual commerce 400 000 government employees but g7 country in the home both physically and culturally to opentext we are proud to announce that we have won the next generation digital platform for the government of canada these q3 wins highlight our strategy execution around the global 10 000 or g 10k for short the g 10k the world s largest companies typically those greater than 2 billion in revenues as well as the world s largest governments and organizations this is the key market or eim in organic growth to date we re only one third penetrated in the g 10k and we can more than double opentext in the coming years by focusing on and connecting the g 10k to our information platform let me also comment on our professional services we run and operate one of the industry s most effective and profitable ps businesses over the last year we ve partnered more with global system integrators we have discontinued low margin contracts we inherited from acquisitions and more work is becoming standardized and moving into the opentext cloud within q3 we delivered 71 million of revenues at 21 margin you should expect the same levels of revenue here in q4 finally let me provide a brief update on our irs matter the irs matter is following a standard irs process and we are now entering the appeals phase as the matter has progressed and we begin to enter the next phase time has strengthened our resolve we remained steadfast in our position that the irs is wrong and we are vigorously defending our position let me transition my remarks to fiscal 2019 in the annual nature of our business we plan on an annual basis we measure ourselves annually our recurring revenue is just that annual or arr we typically deliver large product releases annually and our customer s budget annually while thinking over a multiyear period or an annual business and running our business on an annual cycle allows us to make better long term strategic and operational decisions centered on value creation quarters will vary any low single digit quarterly variance is not meaningful in the context of our annual business i m excited about the growing basis of our annual recurring revenues in fiscal 2009 10 years ago fiscal 2009 our annual recurring revenue was 405 million we have grown arr every year over the last 10 years including this year our arr this fiscal year is on track to be greater than 2 billion representing 400 growth over the last 10 years we are also on target for our fiscal 2019 business plans and we are on target for our fiscal 2019 target ranges and our fiscal 2021 aspirations on our next earnings call we will recap fiscal 2019 and highlight fiscal 2020 targets as well as provide updated three year aspirations that will then include fiscal 2022 on our current annual trend fiscal 2019 will be a strong year for arr revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda dollars and cash flow next let us go through our q4 quarterly factors as a reminder our quarterly factors are those key items for you to factor into your short term financial modeling the items are important but tactical and these items do not affect the long term nature of our business our q4 factors include the following global recession concerns continued we all read the same newspapers and see the same concern around trade wars tariffs goods and wage inflation prolonged brexit uncertainty gdpr and data regulation concerns secondly the u s dollar continues to be strong against the euro pound canadian dollars and yen expect a q4 negative revenue impact of approximately us 20 million due to fx when compared to the prior year third our business is annual as i said earlier and quarters will vary given the strong execution in q3 do not expect the historical sequential revenue uplift in q4 compared to q3 we expect ps revenues to be consistent sequentially and q3 revenues were 71 million also q4 is the last quarter of the fiscal year expect operating expenses to be up quarter over quarter or 4 to 6 given end of your expenses and q4 is a seasonally higher quarter for adjusted ebitda it is historically lower in q2 and consistent with last quarter we expect liaison to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 100 bps in q4 looking beyond the short term now my fourth topic is to talk about the longer term in the next 12 months to 24 months and how we plan on competing growing and creating value let me step back and look at the big picture our business is incredibly strong we have market leading retention rates and our support business powerful product releases and incredible customer loyalty our core business is tremendous and it s about 75 recurring and coming from highly predictable revenue sources this will grow stronger as more workloads and customers move to the opentext cloud as more digital transformation happens as security requirements grow and the market transitions to industry 4 0 and customers rely not just on automation but ai and machine learning as well our flagship offering a release 16 we ll have enhancement pack 6 or ep6 delivered to

continue to run our opentext business system playbook we ll continue to acquire strategically to then integrate and then to innovate and deepen and strengthen our intelligent information platform for customers we are now on the other side of an inflection point an important milestone where we can sell fund our core m a high margin and effective tax rate low capex and strong cash flows has put us

year to date results and similar to prior quarters my direction is will be millions of usd and compare to the same period in the prior fiscal year as you will see from our results the impact of foreign exchange was significant and broad across all lines of revenue at 19 million during the quarter and 31 million year to date given the strength of the usd since the start of our fiscal 2019

revenues remain solid at 76 4 and 75 4 respectively for the quarter and year to date our cloud revenues were particularly strong in the quarter at 239 million up 14 1 or up 16 1 on a constant currency basis we also generated 63 8 million in new mcv up compared to 52 7 million in q3 last year year to date cloud revenues were 666 million up 9 from last year or up 10 on a constant currency basis cloud renewals remain in the mid 90s range our customer support revenues were 311 million down 0 5 or up to 2 3 on a constant currency basis year to date customer support revenues were 933 million up 1 8

down 11 6 or down 8 4 on a constant currency basis year to date professional service revenues were 215 million down 9 3 from last year or down 7 1 on a constant currency basis turning to the details of our margin performance in q3 gaap gross margin for the quarter was 67 up to 210 basis points over the same period last year our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 73 up 140 basis points over the same quarter last year and primarily driven by scale and product mix cloud was 57 up from 55 last year customer support was 90 up from 89 last year our license margin was 97 up from 96 last year and professional services margin was 21 up from 20 last year fx had a negative impact and adjusted gross margin in the quarter by approximately 14 million our adjusted ebitda was 262 million this quarter up 15 year over year adjusted ebitda margin was 36 4 an increase of 320 basis points compared to 33 2 in the prior fiscal year and driven by our deep operating lens into the business as well as the restructuring activities we first announced in our q1 call year to date adjusted ebitda was 816 billion up 10 5 compared to same period last year adjusted ebitda margin year to date was 38 5 an

3 from the same period last year and turning to the balance sheet we had 765 million in cash net of the 70 million payments for catalyst our consolidated net leverage ratio at 1 7x is well within our external debt covenant ratio of 4x and provides us with meaningful flexibility to execute on our total growth strategy in the third quarter dso was 60 days and compared to 67 days in the same quarter last year we achieved record quarterly collections in a quarter and overall a huge applause to the opentext teams for achieving such outstanding cash flow results while integrating two acquisitions in the quarter we continue to learn from and optimize our cash management framework on dividend as mark indicated in his remarks we are very pleased to be raising our quarterly dividend by 15 today up from 15 18 to 17 46 per share our dividend program continues to be a very important component of our capital allocation strategy now for prospectives on our operating model as mark outlined we remain on track to our fiscal 2019 target model which is a reminder is included in our investor presentation on our ir website so let me summarize and reiterate the quarterly factors that we anticipate for our fiscal q4 q3 was negatively impacted by fx of 19 million as we look at where the rates are today as well as geographical level components of our business we expect fx headwind in q4 of approximately 20 million given strong execution in q3 do not expect historical sequential uplift in q4 compared to q3 ps revenues in q4 to remain constant sequentially and q3 ps revenues was 71 million at the last quarter of our fiscal year in q4 we expect operating expenses to be up quarter over quarter in the range of 4 to 6 and given end of your expenses with respect to adjusted ebitda q4 is a seasonally higher quarter although historically lower than q2 and liaison is expected to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 100 basis points in q4 it is important to incorporate these quarterly factors as you model it for q4 note that liaison and catalyst remain on target to be on our operating model and to be fully integrated in the first 12 months on the interest expenses they remain as noted in our fiscal 2019 target model of 144 million to 149 million and our adjusted tax rate remains at 14 so turning to our long term target as mark mentioned with year to date adjusted ebitda margin at 38 5 and year to date operating cash flows at 647 million we are strongly on our way to adjusted ebitda margin in fiscal 2021 of 38 to 40 and operating cash flows target of 1 billion annually as we exist fiscal 2021 on our next earnings call we look forward to recapping fiscal 2019 sharing highlights of our expectations of fiscal 2020 and provide updated three year aspirations to include 2022 at the start of the year we introduced our communication framework and quarterly factors to help you model opentext in a way that is closely aligned to how we see our business and within that framework there are two metrics at the end of each fiscal year that we will provide to you on a historical basis annual organic growth and return on invested capital roic we will update you on both of these annual metrics during our next call so before i conclude i am really excited on behalf of mark and the management team to welcome to opentext harry has joined our team

and the united states please do connect with greg secord for more information so at this time i would like to open the call for your questions operator question and answer session operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from phillip huang of barclays phillip huang hi thanks good afternoon a couple of quick ones for me first i think maybe a question for madhu on the strong licensed revenue i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that just given that it s a seasonally light quarter just based on your comments around the quarterly factors i wanted to make sure i understood it correctly so that it was mainly driven by timing or pull forward of deals i was just wondering if there was â if it was that all driven by perhaps larger deal sizes or any other factors that you d point out mark barrenechea phillip hi itâ s mark here i ll probably take the first one andâ phillip huang hi mark mark barrenechea and on the quarterly factors madhu â yes hello madhu can certainly speak a little more deeply to the quarterly factors we had a strong quarter in both cloud and off cloud and it was driven by competing very effectively against ibm there s a new enterprise software landscape forming so we ve always been agnostic as we transitioned to the cloud and transitioned to our recurring revenue focused we are agnostic to how customers purchase whether it be a license to subscription managed service other options in our cloud but we re not calling out any larger deal q3 was a continuation of our total growth strategy both organically and acquisition i will note we are competing very effectively and when i called the new enterprise software landscape that has a shrinking ibm presence in it madhu ranganathan thank you mark and do you want to expand on your question on the quality factors so that iâ phillip huang yes no just based on the comments around the sequential fiscal q3 to q4 not there because of the strong execution i was just trying to â i guess piece together the puzzle whether it was driven by just a pull forward of deals into fiscal q3 and that s why we re not seeing the historical bump into q4 or was the strength driven by other factors that you would also point out i think mark answered part of the question on not calling on larger deal sizes but i was wondering if there were any other factors that drove the strong license revenue this quarter madhu ranganathan right so mark i think addressed the license revenue i would just reiterate it when you look at q4 revenue right there are three factors one is the fx and we are looking at where we sit today and about 20 million impact to q4 and back to the overall strong execution in q3 license and the cloud it s important to not expect the same historical sequential uplift in q4 and of course professional services for all the reasons outlined we do expect a constant ps revenues between q3 and q4 mark barrenechea i think the only thing i would add to madhu statement if i can is back to the remarks to the prepared remarks or an annual business right in any given quarter might vary a little here or there but we re very focused on the annual nature of the business and again it s all up to the question we re not calling out any big deals we competed second we competed very effective or competing very effectively when i called the new enterprise software landscape weâ re competing effectively against those incumbents like ibm and others and we ve got a strong outlook phillip huang got it that s very helpful and then just on the quickly on the global recessions concern i know it s a very similar wording that you put in the last quarterly factors as well was just wondering if you could give us an update on any visibility on potential impact to your pipeline i know you mentioned that there wasn t any that you ve noted in the last quarter so was wondering what your thoughts are for an update on that comment mark barrenechea yes we re keeping it in quarterly factors we don t see a change yet to the directory of our business but i ll just continue to know â you don t know where brexit still is going to land there are some â there are headline news around growth in europe i ve towing or shrinking slightly typically what you would see is either the close dates moving out deal size shrinking more approvals coming into place we re not seeing any of those statistical factors in our pipeline but i think it s healthy to kind of continue to call out a headline kind of bullet in this category phillip huang that s really helpful thanks very much mark barrenechea thank you madhu ranganathan thank you operator our next question comes from richard tse of national bank financial richard tse yes thank you so i m attending a conference this week and the theme of this event as large had been this explosion of data seems to be still a fairly big pay point for a large of enterprises iâ m just wondering in your role i think on the technology side as well what you see today is sort of your biggest challenges from your customers when it comes to the data mark barrenechea richard thanks thanks for the question i think i ll put my cto hat on for a moment a little more of a cto question and i think back 10 years ago i remember the headline mobile eats the world i think back a few years ago and we re all software companies right and maybe that headline this year or next year is for all data companies and how can each company unlock their data and monetize â leverage the data to make them smarter a more affective competitor in the market or to use their data or data exhaust to go out into the market and goes out and i think back over the last 10 years in erp has really provided a process advantage i think over the next 10 years i look at eim we re here to provide the information advantage so i think the biggest challenge right now when i look into the enterprise and landscape is taken an inventory of the data is it in the right format and do i have the right tools to kind of unlock that data exhaust i think that the greatest challenge right now is i think everyone gets it they understand it the landscape of shifting from process automation to leveraging the data so we see trends like platform consolidation master data management getting data into a usable format picking the right algorithms right â make yourself better or can you then get to a next step to sell your data in the right way for that information advantage but i think the â and then of course is it secured is it governed does it meet the right privacy i think richard is a great actual question and those are some of the immediate things that i see and i think we sit in a great place to help take advantage of it richard tse yes it sounds like you are and i guess the context of my question is that when you look at products that you have like magellan for instance do you think that we re in a position that your enterprise customers are currently evaluating it and we could see this potential that you kind of get a real material increase in those products and also i guess what is the traction been like from magellan lately mark barrenechea yes i think there are two things the first is microsoft is a wide horizontal company you don t have the farm of version of word right well the fine or the paper and pulp version of excel right they re all wide horizontal platform opentext is a wide horizontal platform and we want to get into the global 10 000 and be the standard or the horizontal information platform we want their supply chain cash management content services we want to be thus standards for that intelligent and information core off of that wide horizontal platform and that is the largest opportunity in front of us to keep driving that type of penetration on top of that we re going to canadian deliver vertical applications ot2 is coming to market with healthcare financial services legal tech applications and then another filler on top of that or a long term strategy is the ai and analytics with magellan and of course securing that platform as well so it s still early days with magellan it is contributing to the p l and it s a very strategic piece for us in the future richard tse okay great and just one last one for me with respect to the acquisitions have you changed the comfort level in terms of what your leverage ratio is i think i forgot what it was last quarter but if you just remind us that d be great thank you mark barrenechea yes thanks richard we still believe in the same ratios that we think up to 3x leverage is a comfortable zone i think we all can take some confidence and looking back over the last two years there s one thing for management team to say what they believe in and then you ll deliver data points of performance we said we would be comfortable going over that slightly in the short term and then rapidly delivering if we need it to so we went up to about 3 3x when we completed the document emc acquisition and here we are eight quarters later sitting at 1 7x of a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio so our philosophy is consistent hasn t changed of going up to 3x and i think we can take confidence that if we do need to go above it we would rapidly deliver just as we shown richard tse that s great thank you madhu ranganathan thank you as well operator our next question comes from walter pritchard of citi research walter pritchard hi thanks a couple questions here mark just on the ibm side i m wondering if you could call out which areas of the business are you seeing that i mean obviously not a new trend but they took the best some asset this quarter i m curious which areas of the business are you seeing in particular that resonate positively in the sales pipeline and activity mark barrenechea yes thanks walter i would say three areas the first is filing that we ve called out few times where they have not been innovating as rapidly and the enterprise landscape is just changing excuse me let me correct myself have changed and that there really is a new set of enterprise software companies from slack service now i m putting ourselves in this category as well as companies look to get that information advantage versus a process advantage we ve turned our platform into a cloud ready platform containerize we have a saas version but ot2 and we can really come â we have deep application integration deep saas integration integration to sap to oracle to salesforce and we re just competing very effectively against bionet the second area is ibm sterling commerce which has their commerce platform and the commerce platform has evolved it s evolved into an identity and access management platform we acquired covisint technologies and been able to bring in and bring to their version 2 and version 3 their identity and access platform and i think we re up to almost a for well over 10 million iot devices connected into our network our acquisition of liaison has put us into the market of any to any integration i hate to throw out examples like this but i ll use an example of mulesoft right where we d have a library of 10 000 canonical connectors where we can tie erp to erp cloud to cloud process the process within our business network so we re competing very effectively against ibm and sterling commerce and lastly the ibm cloud is sort of a â clouds are not a place to go to just get a cost advantage it needs to be a platform of innovation and so i look at our cloud today and us being able to provide this full eim back and yes we can provide a cost advantage and security but we can also now provide it as a platform for innovation for the next generational workloads so these are the three areas weâ re competing effectively content services commerce platform and cloud walter pritchard got it and then maybe mark for you as you brought this up on the call around â you said you and sort of a new era and in other side of reflection where you can self fund m a but then still mentioning the 3x leverage is to take away here just as you get larger you can do bigger deals or should we expect i donâ t mistake if you re talking about self funding you maybe looking to take on less leverage going forward help us interpret what youâ re saying there mark barrenechea yes i don t know if it s all of the above or look it s always the right deal at the right price with the right roic and it s really a very simple mantra for us and our pipeline is active as iâ d like to say in small medium and large categories that d be the right company at the right price and the right roic our model is different than other companies we look to acquire integrate and innovate we ve delivered a â we re delivering a horizontal platform so pipeline active we have ample capacity in general we re able â we think as a management of philosophy up to 3x leverage is a good ratio to say it very simply the world will go sideways iâ d like to pay my debt off in three years right i mean that s the philosophy of our ratio and if we take our cash flows and just very simply take out interest take out dividends take out capex that puts us in a place to be able to self fund self perpetuate our core m a walter pritchard okay great thank you operator our next question comes from howard leung of veritas investment research howard leung thank you and thanks taking my question i had a few of them first one iâ ll start with is for the gross cloud margins they re kind of at the 56 57 level now for a few years can you maybe give some comments or some color around what could potentially drive it higher and what you see is the result why it s kind of stayed at that level mark barrenechea howard welcome and thanks for the question mark here so we delivered 56 5 cloud margin in the quarter up 150 basis points year over year and in last quarter we were just under 60 in cloud margin look we re targeting medium term to be in the low 60s for our cloud margin and as we ve onboarded new acquisitions like liaison and catalyst and making investments to grow in the cloud cloud was 243 million in constant currency that was up 16 our margins have dipped a little bit below 60 but all for the right reason right to grow the cloud to onboard a couple great acquisitions and i ll note the margin is up year over year 150 basis points and our target range for the year is between 57 and 59 and we re smack in that range so it s right where we want it to be howard leung okay that s very helpful and then the other one i wanted to touch on was on licensed revenues it looks like for the quarter based on the md a there was a 70 million impact from the 60 566 conversion and i think that was just kind of acceleration of some of the licenses upfront just want to find out for that 70 million how many licenses â term licenses were sold that contributed to the 70 million mark barrenechea howard a very detailed question let me start sort of at the conceptual piece all right so first and foremost for us it s all about how a customer wants to buy and we don t go into the global 10 000 and say you must buy this one way it s all around how a customer wants to procure and deploy so if they want to do that in our cloud off cloud license or in somebody else s cloud we re all in right for us it s all about the annual recurring revenue adjusted ebitda and cash flow so i ll just start at the principal level it s all about how a customer wants to procure second the 606 business it s all new business for us right these are brand new wins these are new contracts it s all new business for us and third there is no alternative it has gap and it is the standard there there is no alternative for us so i don t know if that answers your question or if there s another level to the other question that you have howard leung i guess that i mean i understand it s not an accounting choice and all that it s just the change in the policy i was just wondering for these new licenses which you signed up for the quarter it s not in anyway i guess pulling forward from future quarters it s just kind of new businessâ mark barrenechea no new business new wins howard leung okay mark barrenechea very good wins madhu ranganathan yes howard leung yes now it looks very strong but this quarter so that s good thanks guys that was really helpful mark barrenechea thank you howard appreciated madhu ranganathan and howard thank you as well howard leung no problem operator our next question comes from stephanie price of cibc world markets stephanie price good afternoon i just wanted to touch on services revenue for a minute mark i was hoping you can give us a bit of an update on your thoughts in that services business and maybe go into a bit more detailed to puts and takes that you mentioned in your prepared remarks mark barrenechea yes sounds great thanks thanks stephanie and thanks for the question we run a very â i think of our ps business sort of in three three pillars pillar one is always accelerated time to value for the customer and we run one of the best ps organizations inside a software company our ps organization does an amazing job deploying our software getting accelerated time to value i d put our organization up against anyone s any day second is can you do that profitably and i look back to companies like bmc ca other large enterprise companies would run their ps businesses that no to negative margin and that s just not in our philosophy it s not a loss leader it s a profit center because there is value that we re delivering for customers so those of our revenue levels we ve been able to deliver margins around 20 which is in the zone of the worldâ s best run ps businesses the third sort of pillar if you will is the quantum of the revenue and we ve taken as a strategy that we re going to bring on more global system implementers like an ntt like tcs accenture deloitte others and they re going to go out and put us into their framework and we think we can grow the more strategic revenues of cloud by having that partnership we were going to give up some ps revenues to do that and that s perfectly okay second is as more work becomes standard in the cloud right and it s configured it self service you need less of the ps organization and that s fine as well and then thirdly we acquired businesses that don t quite have our philosophy of how to run a ps business and we need to wean ourselves off that and complete deployments and then move on so i mean those are the three reasons why ps is a down slightly other revenues are up and if all for the right strategic reasons stephanie price great thanks and then in terms of your slide deck a slide on selected customer and product extension seems to be growing here hoping you can talk a little bit cross sell opportunities in the install base and whether they were a factor in the performance in the quarter mark barrenechea yes we have â thanks for calling it out we have in our investor deck i m just reaching for it here slide 13 14 and 15 where we have selective customer and product expansions where kind of showing businesses like coca cola fujitsu gm nestle we re running multiple pillars for us look it is a key strategy for us is to have a strong portfolio of solutions to provide i ve got to go back to some of my earlier comments around how we ve expanded our offering and companies like ibm has not in content services and or the business network i say the strength and the quarter was again i d go back to our two core markets content services and business network and just keep widening the capabilities we re deploying stephanie price great thank you very much mark barrenechea thanks stephanie iâ ll look forward to joining cibc a may 14 madhu ranganathan yep thank you as well operator our next question comes from thanos moschopoulos of bmo capital markets thanos moschopoulos hi good afternoon with respect to your q4 outlook i m still a little unclear in your commentary so just to be very clear are you suggesting there will be no quarter on quarter revenue uptick or are you suggesting that there may be a quarterly revenue uptick but that it will be in more modest uptick than we ve seen historically for q4 mark barrenechea there will be â we expect an uptick just not as a seasonally strong thanos moschopoulos okay great yes that s what i thought i just wanted to confirm that point in terms of cash flows your cash flow was a obviously up year over year as you highlighted although your cash conversion of ebitda was lower than for q3 last year was that just because of a working capital drag from the two recent tuck in acquisitions madhu ranganathan yes thanos this is madhu i would say yes and so the billings of the deferred revenue this quarter but also much higher right so that was a contributor to a conversion but the conversion is still very high keep in mind thanos moschopoulos okay fair enough and just one last one for me was all the liaison catalyst revenue in the cloud services line or was it a sprinkled in some other lines as well madhu ranganathan it s predominant in the cloud services side thanos moschopoulos okay thanks i ll pass the line madhu ranganathan thank you as well mark barrenechea yes thanks operator our next question comes from paul treiber of rbc capital markets paul treiber thanks so much and good afternoon madhu ranganathan hi paul paul treiber hi there i don t want to beat a dead horse on this but you mentioned following that i remember before when they were public they had some very significant deals in the mid year range just hope he can put some bounds around the potential size of deals if you can confirm that there weren t any deals as large as in the figures mark barrenechea yes file net they ve been private a long time having that it had been a private a long time we re not calling out any larger deals in the quarter so i appreciate the commentary it s again we re competing very effectively and our two core market and we re not here to call out any larger transaction paul treiber okay that s fair just turning to document them or emc ecd when you mentioned that earlier how does the â are you seeing documents and customers migrate the latest versions of your products at a similar rate to the core opentext customers and also consider your cloud at a similar rate as your core business mark barrenechea hey paul thanks for the question i could just say off the top of my head i m not seeing any real difference in a rate of upgrade or migration i ll have to go back and kind of check the data but i m pretty data sensitive but i don t nothing sort a jumping out at me as a different rate in terms of embracing the cloud this is a strong upsell opportunity for us and customers are looking i use this phrase will early or a platform for innovation and our cloud allows our customers to get the latest and greatest software you get a fuller stack of software to remove the burdens of security and compliance and management um uptime and really free their brains up to innovate so yes the ability to upsell managed services upsell saas workloads is a strong opportunity for us and the document base paul treiber okay thanks for taking my question mark barrenechea thank you paul operator our next question comes from steven li of raymond james steven li hey guys i have question for madhu yes madhu given 606 has a positive impact on revenue recognition when you do your organic growth calculation next quarter would you be adjusting out the positive 606 impact given your base in 2018 would be on 605 madhu ranganathan thank you for the question i d go back to what mark said earlier growth is growth and new businesses is new business and all of this is new business right so when we look at the q4 we are looking at new businesses and what i d probably point out is and look at the 739 million of revenue in constant currency and even if you took the 21 million that we shared as you know sort of adjustment 605 or 606 it s 718 and if you do apples to apples it was 686 in q3 of last year but 698 for 605 adjusted we still grew from 698 to 718 and i would encourage that s how you think about growth steven li okay thank you madhu ranganathan you re very welcome and thank you as well operator this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr barrenechea for any closing remarks mark barrenechea all right thank you madhu thank you greg thank you harry and thank you everyone for joining our call today i m excited about the quarter the direction of the business our leadership and content services in the business network the opentext cloud and you can obviously hear in my voice i m excited about the future hope to see you to see cibc conference in may and enterprise world in july and have a great rest of the week thank you for joining the call operator this concludes today s conference call you may disconnect your lines thank you for participating and have a pleasant day

positive results through changing market conditions including mandatory production curtailments in alberta and the first quarter of 2019 was no different said mark little president and chief operating officer funds from operations increased to 2 6 billion in the first quarter of 2019 as we continue to execute on our long term strategy funds from operations were 2 585 billion 1 64 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 164 billion 1 32 per common share in the prior year quarter cash flow provided by operating activities which includes changes in non cash working capital was 1 548 billion 0 98 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 724 million 0 44 per common share in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable and inventory operating earnings were 1 209 billion 0 77 per common share and net earnings were 1 470 billion 0 93 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of 985 million 0 60 per common share and net earnings of 789 million 0 48 per common share in the prior year quarter refining and marketing r m delivered record quarterly funds from operations and operating earnings of 1 253 billion and 1 009 billion respectively total oil sands production was 657 200 barrels per day bbls d compared to 571 700 bbls d in the prior year quarter increased production from the ramp up at fort hills and improved syncrude asset utilization of 90 more than offset the impact of mandatory production curtailments implemented by the government of alberta oil sands operations achieved 98 upgrader utilization and synthetic crude oil sco production of 341 200 bbls d despite the impact of mandatory production curtailments on bitumen production hebron production in the first quarter increased to 18 300 bbls d net to the company and is continuing to ramp up following the completion of the fifth production well during the quarter first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 the company distributed 662 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 514 million of common shares in the first quarter of 2019 financial results operating earnings suncor s first quarter 2019 operating earnings were 1 209 billion 0 77 per common share compared to 985 million 0 60 per common share in the prior year quarter and included the impact of the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailments as well as after tax insurance proceeds of 264 million related to the company s assets in libya operating earnings were also favourably influenced by an inventory valuation gain associated with improving crude prices increased overall upstream production and sales volumes narrower heavy crude oil differentials and strong sales from the company s refining assets these factors were offset by lower wti benchmark crude pricing and higher overall operating and transportation costs predominantly attributed to the production ramp up at fort hills an increase in share based compensation costs and an additional 5 working interest in syncrude acquired partway through the first quarter of 2018 operating earnings were also unfavourably impacted by higher royalties associated with the improvement in both bitumen pricing and production the overall impact of crude oil and refined product inventory valuation had a net positive impact on operating earnings of 288 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 86 million net positive impact in the prior year quarter the increase was due to a favourable first in first out fifo inventory valuation adjustment associated with the consumption of less expensive crude feedstock in r m partially offset by a deferral of profit on intersegment sales from oil sands to r m remaining in inventory recorded in the corporate and eliminations segment net earnings net earnings were 1 470 billion 0 93 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net earnings of 789 million 0 48 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors explained in operating earnings above net earnings for the first quarter of 2019 included a 261 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt net earnings in the prior year quarter included an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 329 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a 133 million non cash after tax gain in the exploration and production e p segment associated with the exchange of the company s mineral landholdings in northeast british columbia with canbriam energy inc canbriam the company s investment in canbriam was subsequently written down to nil in the fourth quarter of 2018 following an assessment of forward natural gas prices and the impact on estimated future cash flows funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 585 billion 1 64 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 164 billion 1 32 per common share in the first quarter of 2018 and were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was 1 548 billion 0 98 per common share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 724 million 0 44 per common share for the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable and inventory in addition to the items noted with respect to funds from operations cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by the use of less cash in the company s working capital balances in the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter this was due to a decrease in taxes paid and a smaller increase in the company s inventory value with the prior year quarter including a substantial build of product inventory in preparation for the full turnaround at the edmonton refinery in the second quarter of 2018 operating results suncor s total upstream production was 764 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d during the first quarter of 2019 compared to 689 400 boe d in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the ramp up of fort hills production improved asset reliability at syncrude and the hebron ramp up this was partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments in the province of alberta which took effect at the beginning of the year our upgraders achieved strong reliability throughout the first quarter and our refining business generated record funds from operations illustrating the resiliency of suncor s cash flow and operational flexibility when broader industry challenges exist said mark little oil sands operations production was 396 600 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 404 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease was due to mandatory production curtailments which primarily affected the company s non upgraded bitumen sales as the company maximized the production of higher value sco barrels upgrader utilization improved to 98 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 80 in the prior year quarter with the prior year quarter being impacted by a weather related outage higher upgrader utilization resulted in a decrease to total oil sands operations production due to the approximate 20 yield loss associated with the bitumen upgrading process oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel were 29 95 in the first quarter of 2019 an increase from 26 85 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of mandatory production curtailments and the change in production mix associated with a higher proportion of sco production and lower bitumen volumes in addition to an increase in operating selling and general os g costs oil sands operations os g costs in the first quarter of 2019 included an increase in overburden stripping expenses during the optimal time of the year to complete this work the company expects the increase in this activity in the current period to partially offset oil sands operations cash operating costs in subsequent periods bringing oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel in line with guidance for 2019 total oil sands operations cash operating costs were 1 074 billion compared to 982 million in the prior year quarter and were also impacted by higher natural gas pricing suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 78 400 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 24 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase in production attributed to the ramp up of operations throughout the past year partially offset by mandatory production curtailments fort hills cash operating costs per barrel were 29 60 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 53 65 in the prior year quarter with the improvement primarily attributed to the increase in production despite the mandatory production curtailments suncor s share of syncrude production was 182 200 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 142 300 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in production was primarily due to stronger asset reliability with the prior year quarter impacted by a constrained bitumen feed line and the advancement of upgrader maintenance partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments upgrader utilization at syncrude improved to 90 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 71 in the prior year quarter to help achieve this suncor allocated a portion of its mandated production limit by the alberta government to syncrude which reduced lower value bitumen sales at oil sands operations syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 37 05 in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 50 75 in the prior year quarter due to the combination of higher production and lower os g costs resulting from a decrease in maintenance expenses partially offset by the increase in natural gas prices production volumes at e p were 107 100 boe d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 117 700 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to the continuing staged return of white rose to full operations as well as natural declines in the united kingdom partially offset by the increase in production from hebron during the first quarter of 2019 the company received 363 million in insurance proceeds for its libyan assets 264 million after tax the proceeds may be subject to a provisional repayment that may be dependent on the future performance and cash flows from suncor s libyan assets first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to ramp up to an estimated peak of 10 500 bbls d net to suncor in 2020 suncor is a 30 partner in the project refinery crude throughput was 444 900 bbls d and refinery utilization was 96 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 453 500 bbls d and a utilization rate of 98 in the prior year quarter with solid reliability achieved in both quarters refined products sales increased in the first quarter of 2019 to 542 800 bbls d compared to 512 900 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase attributed to record canadian wholesale sales volumes and higher retail sales volumes strategy update suncor s 2019 capital program is focused on the enhancement and optimization of the company s operating asset performance safety and reliability including projects focused on delivering increased earnings and funds from operations through further cost savings and structural margin improvements in addition the company is developing step out opportunities and asset extensions within the offshore business in e p excluding capitalized interest the company invested 875 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 1 214 billion in the prior year quarter this was due primarily to the decrease in capital associated with the staged completion and commissioning of the fort hills extraction plants in the first half of 2018 as well as a decrease in asset sustainment and maintenance capital associated with lower overall planned maintenance preparation expenditures following the execution of a more significant maintenance program in the spring of 2018 at both oil sands and r m although capital spending was lower in the first quarter of 2019 the company s capital guidance range of 4 9 billion to 5 6 billion remains unchanged drilling activity at hebron is ongoing and production continues to ramp up ahead of schedule other e p activity in the first quarter included development drilling at hibernia white rose and buzzard

for the past few years venezuela has been plagued by president nicolás maduro s inflationist policies which have caused a disastrous economic and political crisis that is ravaging the standard of living for its citizens to the point where hundreds of thousands are fleeing the country in hopes of survival this year alone the imf expects venezuela to reach an inflation rate of 10 000 000 percent although venezuela currently holds the largest oil reserve in the world estimated at over 300 billion barrels of oil it has become one of the worst countries to live in ranking 179 out of 180 just ahead of north korea with regard to economic freedom what is interesting about this particular situation is that at one point in time venezuela was considered one of the most prosperous economies in latin america how did venezuela fall so low it was the fourth richest nation per capita in 1950 the country is now experiencing a disconnect between its abundance of natural resources and the desolate poverty sweeping its society the question we must ask ourselves is how did this come about venezuela s main export for the past several decades has been oil today it accounts for 98 percent of its revenues since 1976 the oil industry has been nationalized through the company pdvsa petróleos de venezuela s a whereby the government controls the means of production though private corporations are allowed to compete they are severely penalized through taxation though private corporations are allowed to compete they are severely penalized through taxation with a country heavily concentrated on oil exports and operated through a state controlled monopoly the sustainability of venezuela s public services is extremely dependent upon oil revenues the background of venezuela s present economic crisis stems from maduro s attempt to sustain chávez s previous socialist policies through monetary expansion following a massive collapse in the global demand for oil when maduro became president in 2013 venezuela had already been struggling to support its public services and experienced 56 2 percent inflation for the year following a monetary expansion of 60 percent maduro ruined their economy within a matter of months of becoming president of venezuela nicolás maduro declared an economic war by imposing price controls and minimum wage increases alleging that capitalists had been speculating on consumer goods causing shortages for its citizens as a result of the increase in domestic goods and services whenever politicians stand upon their lofty pulpits condemning businessmen for the increase in price of their goods and services i am reminded of the wise words of ludwig von mises who said the most important thing to remember is that inflation is not an act of god that inflation is not a catastrophe of the elements or a disease that comes like the plague inflation is a policy unfortunately this wasn t the only time maduro would attempt to negate inflation through market intervention as venezuelan oil imports into the united states have faced a dramatic decline of 38 percent from 811 000 barrels per day priced at 101 59 the month maduro took office to 500 000 barrels per day priced at 45 68 by the end of 2018 figure 1 crude oil prices january 2013 through march 2019 macrotrends with the decline in the price of oil the past several years the revenues in venezuela have not been enough to support maduro s social programs to compensate for the decrease in revenues the government has relied on the central bank s printing press to help provide liquidity during the downturn in demand for oil to help sustain maduro s social programs and to monetize both the fiscal deficits and debt incurred by the state operated oil monopoly pdvsa out of control inflation in 2014 the money supply expanded even further by 76 percent and inflation increased to 68 5 percent with gdp contracting by 3 9 percent with the continued economic stress of public liabilities and weak demand for oil venezuela defaulted on its debt in 2017 after failing to make a 200 million coupon payment on its bonds with further attempts to alleviate economic stress and to attempt to sustain its socialist programs through monetary expansion inflation spiraled out of control reaching a record level of 2 295 981 percent in 2018 today mainstream economists hold the notion that inflation is an increase in the price of goods or services the issue with this definition is that it fails to get to the cause of the increase if we neglect the cause then we may easily agree with any politician s viewpoint that the solution to decreasing the cost is to target businesses through price controls but that is a fallacious belief inflation is the overextended issuance of money whose consequence leads to a generalized increase in the cost of goods or services when price controls are enforced to combat inflation the only result we experience is a shortage of goods because the prices are artificially lower than what the market would price these goods as is the case in venezuela inflation is the opposite of what we are told to believe inflation is the overextended issuance of money whose consequence leads to a generalized increase in the cost of goods or services the increase in the supply of money is promulgated by the central bank which in modern day economies has a monopoly over the issuance of money monetary central bank policies the central bank attempts to impose various monetary policies to help create economic growth and stability through the manipulation of interest rates by dictating what the supply of money should be one facet of how the central bank controls the supply of money is through open market operations this process is where the central bank either buys or sells government securities and attempts to raise or lower interest rates when the central bank attempts to pursue an inflationary policy it will purchase government and other debt securities from a bank with money created out of thin air the bank is then credited the amount of the purchase and has newly available credit ready to be lent out to consumers with more readily available to be lent out interest rates will lower and entice business owners and individuals to borrow more than they would before the central bank undertook the purchase of debt securities from the bank individuals that take on this new money will begin to bid up prices of goods and services as a result of having more monetary units than before this will create an environment stimulating an artificial demand where there is more money willing to be exchanged for goods and services than before when the supply of money is increased and the goods and services stay relatively the same the cost of goods will go up as the value of each monetary unit decreases with each monetary unit now worthless individuals will invariably be able to buy fewer goods than before as a result of the expansion of money the decrease in value per each monetary unit is a benefit for a government heavily laden with debts which is why they encourage such inflationary policies by the central bank hypothetically if a government sold 10 000 bonds each at a face value of 1 000 10 000 000 in total with a coupon rate of four percent the interest payment would be 400 000 a year in total inflation is a hidden tax if this same government experienced an average inflation rate of five percent for those 30 years within its country each year the purchasing power of its bonds would be eroded by 500 000 thus when the bonds mature and it is time to repay this government will repay with money worth much less than it was initially the practice of governments inflating their debt away has been characterized as a hidden tax upon its citizens by ron paul the former us representative from texas who has long been a well spoken advocate against central banking while the debt becomes unnoticeably less cumbersome to carry for the government the expense is paid by the civilians through the gradual decrease in purchasing power and an increase in the cost of living understand that the next time you hear a politician complaining about the rise in prices of goods and services there is a high chance they are the reason for that increase before we buy into what a politician says let us remember that a monetary expansion by a central bank is merely an inflationary policy disguised as an attempt to promote economic growth

velocity and performance motor drilling fleets including atlas motors these planned expenditures are expected to be financed from a combination of one or more of the following cash flow from operations the corporation s unused credit facilities or equity if necessary however if a sustained period of market uncertainty and financial market volatility persists in 2019 the corporation s activity levels cash flows and access to credit may be negatively impacted and the expenditure level would be reduced accordingly conversely if future growth opportunities present themselves the corporation would look at expanding this planned capital expenditure amount outlook the first quarter results are a continuation of the positive momentum built in the 2018 year and were driven by the corporation s strategic initiatives focused on the us market and building a fleet of disruptive technologies phx energy s us division has consistently demonstrated its growth potential over the last 2 years and the corporation s high performance technologies remain in high demand and are contributing to the improvements in revenue and profitability in the first quarter the us remained the largest area of operation for the corporation and the majority of phx energy s premium technologies such as velocity systems atlas motors and powerdrive orbit rss were deployed in the us the us industry remains extremely favourable and with the corporation s unique position phx energy s growth strongly outpaced the industry phx energy s us operating days increased 38 percent quarter over quarter as compared to the 9 percent increase in the us rig count this increased activity combined with the premiums and surcharges related to the high performance technology has led the us division to consistently grow phx energy remains optimistic that it can further build upon the strong growth and market share gains over the past few quarters as additional atlas and velocity capacity is deployed later this year and into 2020 commodity prices appear to have recovered from the decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and if these levels persist industry activity may be greater than anticipated and this may further increase the potential opportunities for phx energy as expected the canadian industry remains challenged with limited market access and political uncertainty both the industry and phx energy saw activity levels decrease quarter over quarter although the corporation s strong position in this market sheltered it slightly phx energy experienced a 19 percent decline in operating days as compared to the industry s decline of 35 percent the canadian industry has seen improvements in the price of canadian crude oil and this provides some optimism that industry activity will not see steeper declines as the year progresses in the first quarter the spring break up period began earlier than is typical and this slow period will continue through the second quarter rig counts are currently trending 30 percent below what they were last year and in spite of these activity levels phx energy remains committed to the canadian industry and protecting its strong market share for the future the first quarter was very similar to the fourth quarter of 2018 for phx energy s international operations the albania division continued to operate on 3 rigs while the russian operations relied more on the mwd rental business as key clients decreased their drilling programs the russian division is focused on gaining more full service work and phx energy believes in upcoming quarters activity levels will begin to increase technology update as the industry continues to strive for efficiencies core directional technologies have changed the time and economics for operators to drill long horizontal wells making directional services the most impactful services for operators performance and cost of drilling as a directional provider who has successfully developed manufactured and deployed these advanced technologies phx energy continues to be recognized as an industry leader which is positively contributing to its financial and operational results as in the fourth quarter of 2018 the surcharges and premiums generated from phx energy s high performance technologies aided the strong revenue and profitability achieved and phx energy has dedicated its 2018 and 2019 capital expenditure programs to expanding the fleets of velocity systems and atlas motors in the quarter phx energy continued to operate its fleet of powerdrive orbit rss and is leveraging its ability to rent this technology to meet demand when it exceeds its own fleet capacity as 2019 progresses phx energy will continue to execute on its strategies for technology development us growth and protecting its

operational results including record quarterly results for adjusted ebitda and adjusted cash flow from operating activities while continuing to announce new major projects supporting ongoing growth of our business quarterly results were driven by strong year over year increases in operating results in the pipelines and facilities divisions as a result of new assets placed into service and higher utilization of existing assets as well as higher ngl sales volumes and a realized gain on commodity related derivatives in the marketing business the most notable achievement during the quarter was our announcement that pembina along with petrochemical industries company k s c of kuwait pic reached a positive final investment decision to construct a 550 000 tonne per annum integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through their equally owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical corporation the announcement was the culmination of many years of hard work with pic to develop a project that is well positioned to capitalize on alberta s abundant supply of propane and undertake value added processing that benefits all of pembina s stakeholders the province of alberta and indeed all of canada sanctioning of the pdh pp facility is the largest step taken to date by pembina in executing its strategy to secure global market prices for customers hydrocarbons produced in western canada and provides another exciting platform for future growth we also were pleased to announce another expansion of the peace pipeline system phase viii which will accommodate incremental customer demand in the montney area by debottlenecking constraints accessing downstream capacity and further enhancing product segregation on the system phase viii is yet another example of the advantages that our strategic footprint provides namely the opportunity to complete staged expansions that deliver timely and reliable transportation service solutions for our customers with the approval of our pdh pp facility and phase viii we currently have 5 5 billion of secured projects that will diversify and strengthen our

in the basins where pembina operates the company is committed to the jordan cove lng project as a means of delivering long lived highly economic north american natural gas resources to global demand markets regulatory processes for jordan cove are progressing on march 29 2019 the ferc issued a draft environmental impact statement which provides a constructive framework for the approval of jordan cove essentially as proposed with reasonable conditions that work with the project development process and with only minor suggested changes a final ferc decision is expected by january 2020 oregon state permit approvals including those under the coastal zone management act and the oregon department of environmental quality 401 are also progressing with decisions on both approvals expected by the end of 2019 each of the permits are a critical component of the regulatory process and enable the commercial viability and critical investment in oregon to move forward pembina continues to see jordan cove as a viable project however the company has decided to limit pre fid capital investment on non permitting related activities pembina has approved incremental funding of approximately 50

operating activities was 29 2 million project adjusted ebitda was 53 7 million first quarter results made for a solid start to the year with project adjusted ebitda and operating cash flow both ahead

a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap therefore this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies please refer to non gaap disclosures on page 13 of this news release for an explanation and a reconciliation of project adjusted ebitda as used in this news release to project income loss financial results for the three months ended march 31 2019 first quarter 2019 results were adversely affected by power purchase agreement ppa expirations at williams lake and the three san diego projects in april 2018 the williams lake ppa expired and was replaced by a short term contract extension with less favorable economics this extension is currently scheduled to expire on september 30 2019 the ppas for the san diego projects were terminated effective march 1 2018 the impact of these ppa expirations and short term extensions was as expected on the positive side tunis returned to service under a new ppa in october 2018 and the start up maintenance expense incurred in the 2018 period did not recur in addition generation at curtis palmer was significantly above the long term average due to higher water flows thus results for the project were better than expected project income net income and project adjusted ebitda project income for the first quarter of 2019 was 30 6 million a 2 3 million increase from 28 3 million in the year ago period although project revenue decreased 7 0 million this was offset by lower project expenses the revenue decrease was mostly due to the ppa expirations at williams lake and the san diego projects partially offset by increased revenues from tunis which was not in operation in the 2018 period and curtis palmer which benefited from higher water flows depreciation expense decreased at the san diego projects which were fully depreciated by february 2018 and at nipigon due to the amortization of the ppa intangible asset in 2018 operation and maintenance expense decreased primarily because 2 4 million of start up maintenance at tunis incurred in 2018 did not recur fuel expense was lower mostly because the san diego projects ceased operation in february 2018 these favorable expense comparisons were partially offset by a 6 1 million unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments net income attributable to atlantic power corporation for the first quarter of 2019 was 8 9 million compared to 15 9 million in the first quarter of 2018 the reduction of 7 0 million was primarily attributable to a 13 2 million decrease in mostly unrealized foreign exchange gain which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar appreciated from december 31 2018 to march 31 2019 and a 6 8 million unfavorable change in the fair value of the convertible debenture conversion option included in other expense income net these negative factors were partially offset by the 2 3 million increase in project income a 4 1 million reduction in interest expense resulting from lower debt balances a reduction in the interest rate on the company s credit facilities a 4 5 million increase in the gain on the redemption of preferred shares and a reduction in income tax expense project adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2019 increased slightly to 53 7 million from 53 4 million in the first quarter of 2018 results benefited from the start up of tunis under a new ppa in october 2018 and the absence of start up expenses incurred in 2018 3 5 million higher water flows at curtis palmer 2 7 million and to a less significant degree higher generation and a contractual rate increase at orlando and higher dispatch at manchief and frederickson increases at these projects were mostly offset by a decrease at williams lake 5 1 million due to the less favorable short term ppa and modest decreases at other projects including the three san diego projects due to the early termination of the ppas chambers due to reduced generation due to less favorable pjm power prices and mamquam due to lower water flows cash flow cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 was 29 2 million a decrease of 21 1 million from 50 3 million in the first quarter of 2018 changes in working capital accounted for 22 7 million of the year over year decline the 2018 result benefited from an 18 3 million release of working capital by kapuskasing north bay and the three san diego projects when they ceased operation distributions from unconsolidated affiliates were 0 8 million lower in 2019 than 2018 comparisons were also affected by the short term ppa extension at williams lake less favorable economics partially offset by positive results for tunis and curtis palmer as compared to 2018 cash interest payments and cash taxes were 0 6 million lower in 2019 than 2018 excluding changes in working capital operating cash flow in the 2019 period was 1 6 million higher than the comparable 2018 period cash provided by investing activities for the first quarter of 2019 was 1 2 million largely due to 1 5 million of salvage proceeds from the san diego projects compared to a 1 1 million use of funds in the first quarter of 2018 cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of 2019 was 25 5 million as compared to 45 7 million in the year ago period in 2019 the company repaid 15 8 million of term loan and project debt invested 7

the company s liquidity at march 31 2019 was 197 9 million up 6 5 million from 191 4 million at december 31 2018 the increase in liquidity was entirely attributable to an increase in cash at march 31

repurchased 44 390 common shares at an average price of 2 15 per share 2019 guidance the company has not provided guidance for project income or net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable gaap metrics including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses these factors which generally do not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda the company is maintaining its guidance for 2019 project adjusted ebitda in the range of 175 million to 190 million as compared to the 2018 reported level of 185 1 million the most significant negative factor affecting 2019 guidance is the short term contract extension at williams lake which became effective in april 2018 and is currently scheduled to expire at the end of september 2019 the economics of the short term extension are less favorable than the original ppa on the positive side project adjusted ebitda for tunis and manchief is expected to be significantly higher this year due to the non recurrence of start up and overhaul related expenses respectively incurred in 2018 the company s guidance assumes average water conditions for its hydro projects in 2018 water flows at curtis palmer were very close to average while those for mamquam were better than average results in the first quarter of 2019 benefited relative to expectations from higher water flows at curtis palmer which resulted in generation significantly above the long term average some or even all of this may reverse over the remainder of the year table 3 provides a bridge of the company s 2019 project adjusted ebitda guidance to an estimate of 2019 cash provided by operating activities for purposes of providing this bridge to a cash flow measure the impact of changes in working capital is assumed to be nil the decline in 2019 estimated cash provided by operating activities from the 2018 level of 137 5 million is largely attributable to the working capital assumption chambers project debt amortization of 5 2 million captured in the adjustment for equity method

columbia in late april bc hydro exercised its option to extend the amended energy purchase agreement with williams lake by three months to september 30 2019 the project has been operating under this short term extension since april 2 2018 the short term extension is subject to the approval of the bc utilities commission bcuc which recently issued a revised schedule providing for additional arguments and responses through may 8 a recent report prepared by the bc government is supportive of biomass re contracting and the company has begun discussions with bc hydro on a potential longer term contract in addition in early april the government issued a directive to the bcuc requiring it to approve cost recovery in bc hydro s rates of any new biomass contracts entered into as a result of this process separately in april 2019 the environmental appeal board issued a final decision on the amendment to the williams lake air permit the amendment had been sought by the company to allow the use of up to 50 rail ties in the fuel mix for the project and had been approved in september 2016 but was appealed by various parties in its decision on the appeal the board modified the permit amendment to a 35 annual limit and also imposed a daily limit of 50 the company has not determined whether it will proceed with investment in a new fuel shredder which would be required to accommodate rail ties as an increased part of the fuel mix but views the board ruling as preserving the option to do so a decision to proceed with such an investment would be dependent on a new long term ppa with bc hydro the economics of the shredder investment and the outlook for the long term supply of conventional fuel in the region decommissioning of san diego projects as previously reported the company is required by its land use agreements with the u s navy to decommission its three project sites in san diego naval station naval training center and north island the company continues to work with

first quarter 2019 sales of 261 9 million beat the prior year quarter by 10 organic sales growth was 8 4 without the impact of the dutch power acquisition which we completed in march industrial division first quarter 2019 sales of 158 4 million represented a nearly 20 increase over the prior year quarter all product groups contributed to this division s continued strong organic sales growth agricultural division for the first quarter of 2019 sales were 53 2 million down 9 3 from the prior year quarter high crop yields and us trade disputes continue to negatively affect crop prices farm income and demand for new equipment we estimate retail sales of rotary cutters the primary product in this division are down 5 to 10 industry wide compared to the prior year quarter recent adverse weather conditions have also reduced equipment usage negatively affecting agricultural part sales furthermore this division sales were affected by the installation of a paint system upgrade which shut down production in its largest manufacturing facility for several days in january european division first quarter 2019 sales were 50 3 million up 6 5 over the prior year quarter but down 1 2 without the effect of the dutch power acquisition excluding an unfavorable currency translation effect of 3 5 million this division s local currency organic sales growth was 6 3 above the prior year quarter first quarter 2019 gross margin of 63 3 million grew 5 over the prior year first quarter our first quarter gross margin was 24 2 of sales which compares to 25 3 of sales for the prior year quarter the compression of percentage gross margin was due to several factors first the carryover impact of material cost increases had yet to be fully offset by mitigating pricing actions by the end of the quarter we began to see this effect easing due to reduced steel costs and a lower mix of free price increased shipments percentage gross margins were also affected by an unfavorable mix of high margin aftermarket parts sales to total sales while parts sales grew 3 9 over prior year they totaled 18 4 of first quarter 2019 sales compared to 19 5 in the prior year quarter with the difference mainly due to higher growth of industrial division whole goods sales year over year first quarter 2019 operating income of 22 6 million was 5 8 percent higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to industrial division organic sales growth and partially offset by the factors constraining gross margins already discussed first quarter 2019 operating income was 8 6 of sales compared to 9 of sales for the prior year quarter net income for the first quarter was at a record 15 3 million or 1 30 per diluted share compared to prior year quarter net income of 14 6 million or 1 24 per diluted share record first quarter 2019 ebitda was 28 9 million which was up 7 7 over the prior year quarter trailing 12 month ebitda of 126 5 million was up 13 3 over the prior year trailing 12 month result net cash used by operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 32 4 million which compares to 28 1 million net cash used in the prior year quarter the year to year difference of 4 3 million was mostly due to the ebitda growth being more than offset by higher receivables and inventories while most of this working capital investment is driven higher by higher whole goods demand in the industrial division slowing agricultural equipment retail sales also had a negative impact this is because first quarter retail sale usually generates a replacement order and the related receivable from the dealer becomes immediately due and payable prior to its invoice term also impacting operating cash flow was continued growth and demand for vacuum trucks this resulted in a 7 5 million increase in our rental fleet investment compared to a 5 7 million increase in the prior year quarter investing cash flows were primarily the use of 50 5 million to fund the dutch power acquisition capital spending for the first quarter 2019 was 5 3 million compared to 7 6 million for the prior year quarter this difference is primarily due to the timing of projects as we expect capital spending for the year to be above prior year levels due to the dutch power acquisition and to a lesser extent high levels of investment and working capital rental fleet and capital assets debt net of cash increased 69 9 million over the prior year first quarter our order backlog remains at a very healthy level ending the first quarter at 258 million including the dutch power acquisition which is about 8 4 higher than the prior year first quarter without the acquisition backlog increased 2 6 year over year in summary our first quarter 2019 results were highlighted by record first quarter sales up 10 record first quarter net income up almost 5 record first quarter ebitda of nearly 29 million completion of the dutch power acquisition and a strong quarter end backlog of 258 million i d now like to turn the call back over to ron ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director okay thank you dan we re pleased to once again start off another fiscal year in a positive fashion with record sales and earnings as usual there were some pluses and minuses in the quarter and certainly our industrial division was one of the big pluses as they had another strong quarter with good sales in earnings growth and we believe they are poised due to their backlog and the market outlook to continue to move forward in 2019 at a very healthy pace on the other hand our ag division had a weaker start to the year and we were constrained by the continuing soft agricultural market conditions which was further limited in the first quarter by some adverse weather conditions and we were also a little disappointed by our margins which were a little weaker than they should have been there were several factors contributing to this including a little higher level of shipments particularly at the start of the year in january that were booked prior to price increases we had implemented late last year in response to input cost inflation in the second half of 2018 so we also have the cost and associated disruption in january due to a major system upgrade at our biggest agricultural plant both of these situations are now behind us and while the soft agricultural market and lower farm incomes are continuing to constrain sales we feel our margins should started to improve in the second half of the first quarter and should continue to improve as we move forward so despite some of the pressure in the first quarter we feel that the pace of input cost increases have actually softened somewhat compared to last year and in some areas such as steel have actually come down a little not only in ag but across all of our business areas our european operations actually did well particularly given the somewhat overall softer economic conditions in continental europe but due to currency changes in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the previous year what was increased sales before acquisitions in local currency ended up as a decrease when translated to us dollars as dan pointed out and while we cannot control exchange rates we actually feel the outlook for our european operations remains positive on a local basis and this will certainly be helped by the acquisition in march of dutch power company the dutch power is a very nice fit with our overall strategy they provide some very nice complementary products to add to our existing range and they re just a good well run company and good addition we re glad to have as part of alamo group we re also pleased and i know commented in the last couple of years about we re looking at a lot of acquisition opportunities but valuations have been a bit of a challenge we re pleased that this year already we re looking at we ve not completed one we re looking at others the pipeline remains very buoyant and i think valuations are a little bit more in actionable ranges for us so acquisition activity is not the only things that we re actively keeping busy we actually have a lot of initiatives we re pursuing right now this includes a higher level of capital spending aimed at improving our manufacturing technology and making us more efficient some of this we ve even discussed previously like the new plant we re building in wisconsin which will allow us to combine the three super products vacuum truck facilities in that area into one much more efficient plant and but there s a lot of other initiatives on technology they re not as big but they should individually provide very nice returns on the incremental investments we re making in that area we re also very pleased that our ongoing development efforts are resulting in a steady stream of new and innovative products that we can add to our range so very recent examples of that are our mcconnel robo cut motors in europe and our alamo industrial mantis power units that has recently been introduced to the markets here in north america so we continue to believe that product development will be a big driver of our ongoing organic growth we also have some other internal developments which i think will benefit our company moving forward that i think are worth commenting on the first is that i know in december we announced that we were going to implement a share repurchase program aimed at sort of limiting any creep in our stock and let s say we ve already begun to implement that program and that is under way and the second we just announced in this in yesterday s press release that there is going to be a change in our reporting that we will implement later this year for years we have been reporting partly according to product lines and partly by geography whereas this will change and we ll put all of our reporting along product lines which we will believe will make us a little more transparent as well as help us operate more efficiently internally because putting all product groups together so we ll change from going from three reporting divisions to two just the industrial and ag since our european division has always been a mix of the same two divisions so as you can see we have a lot going on at alamo group and while there are certainly some challenges along the way we feel the stability and strength of our markets in general and our ongoing improvement initiatives combined with some acquisitions and new product introductions will continue to lead us very positively throughout this current 2019 and as usual we thank you for your support in this journey and with that i would like to open the floor to any questions you might have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi guys good morning dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning joe ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst wanted to ask on the agriculture sector so i wondering you talked about how i think at least in the press release if not also in your commentary there related to weather and that being a factor in addition to obviously we ve heard from other companies that the sector overall is still weak here just wondering sort of especially with the weather comments how you re thinking about growth as we progress through the year relative to the 6 ex currency that we saw in the first quarter dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean it s really sort of hard to say i mean certainly i think weather may affected some spare parts sales a little because the farmers were a little slower getting into the fields but i mean i think once they get in there the activity will pick up but certainly farm incomes are down and we feel that i mean i say it s we re seeing that equipment purchases in total had been off i think weather i mean there is still some rain in the midwest and i mean but that s fairly localized i mean i think on a broad basis i think weather will get better like say the winter was a little later so it caused some delays i don t see it causing any major disruptions long term i mean like to the whole year just some delays but i think it s just the ag conditions themselves there is a little too much green in storage and so i mean they need to get crop prices up before i think we re going to see equipment sales start to rebound joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then on the margin side first off could you quantify how much costs were related to the system upgrade dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer like say i know exactly what the system upgrade cost but it was the disruptions in other areas that and i don t think we handled it as well as we should to be honest but i can t give you a number for that so i really ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director the actual system upgrade was only inaudible was a couple hundred thousand dollars but there was really more of the days we were not producing product that was the main cost joe it lasted a little more than a week and it just kind of shut us down for a little bit because you can t obviously run your lean process until you get ready so joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay so that as well as the adverse sort of price cost situation which i assume improves maybe even starting in the second quarter that must ve cost over 1 million dollars at least would you say dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer correct yes all that cost over 1 million yes ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and in terms of the price cost i guess overall but you certainly sort of highlighted it more at the ag segment that starts to improve in second quarter considering the price increases that you have put in place dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely i mean because the ag sector is one of the sectors where we sort of do out of season pre season sales for dealer stocking orders and so we had i mean some backlog at the end of the year that was prior to our latest price increases so we yes but most of that is behind us most of that backlog is now shipped that was at the lower margins and i think most of what we re shipping going forward is all at higher margins plus in the second and third quarters our aftermarket parts are a higher percentage of our agricultural sales while because those are the active quarters for farm activity that s when they re like say the first and fourth quarters is more is higher percent of equipment sales versus second thirds are the percent of part sales goes up ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director we know that some of our material costs are coming down because we had negotiated based upon orders placed back in the fourth quarter and so the lead with the lead times of those particular products we know that those are going to be coming as well joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great and then at the industrial segment very strong quarter on the top line part of that i assume was a little bit of that was due to the favorable comp and the fact that you did have some production disruptions in the first quarter last year with that strike at the one facility of yours could you sort of give us an idea if you can at all how much of that was related to sort of that comp and what is sort of normalized growth i mean 20 is not sort of normalized i assume you would agree any way of sort of defining what sort of a normal growth was ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director actually 0 5 ph percentage of that growth was normalized in this case just because the backlog went up i mean we actually had very good bookings in the quarter we were helped by some new product introductions but yes no actually it was the comp affect was actually fairly minimal joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director it only affected the gradall plant i mean real battle zone one more we had but and i mean some things like i know even last year we were saying like our snow group was off a little this year i mean i d like say the late winter and heavy snow throughout this year certainly maybe caused farmers to be late but it made our snow division actually have a pretty good year finished last year very strong and start this year very good so snow was up and that had nothing to do with sort of the great all strike last year so i mean actually like i said these comps were a little off than last year but this year like they were just solid performance across all products within the division dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer i think last year we said it was only about 5 million impact on the top line ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director from a sales standpoint yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer for the strike ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director just related to the strike joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right okay just lastly and i ll hop back in queue i m just curious regarding the new segment reporting is there any more color or how significant is this i guess in terms of productivity and cost improvements or what not could you speak to that or any more color regarding that how significant it is the kind of dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer i think in the short term there won t be a lot i think it ll make us more efficient internally as we re having like units same kind of products in europe and the us start working together better and make that a little bit more efficient and make the flow of information between the units go a little bit better i don t think this is a major change but this we actually truly are changing the way we operate the business internally i mean you re doing a reorganization and so we have to tell everybody that we re doing it and it s not a big deal but i think it s the right deal and just be a pretty small incremental effect but it ll help us be more efficient moving forward joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great thanks a lot appreciate it dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director thanks operator all right thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from deforest hinman with walthausen co deforest hinman walthausen co analyst hi thanks for taking the questions just little more thinking about backlog while materials have been moving around can you help us understand if the implied margin in the backlog is higher or lower versus what we ve been doing maybe over the last quarter or last couple of quarters dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think like i said we have most of the they had a little low margin product in ag in the backlog we actually still have a little low margin product in europe in our rivard unit in backlog which is probably going to take another couple quarters in fact that i mean we had some big bookings early last year we ve had cost increases that have impacted those and some of those orders are being fully shipped in the second and the third quarter of this year well i mean are going to being shipped for the last two quarters and the next two quarters so that s a little bit but i would say in general those our backlog is at higher margin than it was it revealed in the first quarter we definitely had like say it had some residual ag products so i think i mean in total our margin and our backlog will be better in the second and third quarters and combined with the fact that costs aren t going up quite as much steel prices are actually coming down and the fact that like say we did some price last year was an odd year usually we do one price increase a year we did actually two last year and already one this year so i think the margin and backlog were in better shape than we were say three four months ago deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s very helpful dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer and heavily focused on the ag because i mean the industrial stuff usually is more build to order and we don t not have big lump borders like we do in ag or like we did this one in europe in rivard so i mean that kind of stuff where we respond quicker on pricing on cost changes and the majority of the backlog is in the industrial division deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay very helpful on the inventories they were touched on in their press release it sounds like to some extent there s inventory build and the queue it s kind of across the board raw materials finished goods and dutch power project ph added some is going to add some inventory or did add inventory in the quarter can you help us understand how that moves over the course of the year or do we have any internal target that you re willing to share in terms of where we think that inventory needs to go either in terms of absolute dollar basis or inventory turn metric dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer certainly last year inaudible prices were going up but lead times were going up and so i mean i think we found ourselves ordering sort of in advance and so we end up with a little too much and i think we didn t plan our inventory as well so that s why and then when ag sales fell off a little this quarter i mean we actually had inventory in the backlog to meet demand that didn t fully develop so we ended up with a little more there i think we just didn t manage that as well as we should have but i mean we don t i mean to give out we have individual targets for units that we need to get back in line i mean just sort of gross numbers i think in the next quarter or two we need to reduce at least 20 million out of inventory on adjusted for whatever sales increase there are but just on today s basis that i say i expect to get at least 20 million out in the next quarter or two deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s helpful and then we ve closed the dutch power deal can you give us an update on the deal pipeline and maybe help us understand some of the multiples that you re seeing dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer the deal pipeline is actually staying pretty active we re seeing lots of stuff i mean half of what we re interested in i mean those doesn t really fit us in our strategy but even the things we re we d like i mean we re actually inaudible from our side is spending a lot more time on just analyzing and looking at the deals right now than we typically do and that s why i said i mean which comes down to a case by case basis but i think in general we re seeing that valuations have softened a little bit and so yes i mean they are we re not like these double digit multiples but i m seeing those the last several deals i have actually seen since the first of the year have been certainly below that and i think that bodes well for us come down to a case by case basis but at least we re getting more to look at and i think we ve done one and i think we re seeing other a couple of things that we re interested in that are probably actionable valuations are actionable that will allow us i mean our goals it s not as much what the multiple is and what we think within a couple of years we can have it that it needs to be we making the same kind of returns as our organic as our internal businesses are already so that s sort of where our target is and so we analyze each case of what we can do between synergies and growth opportunities what would can we get it to where it s making the same kind of returns that are the existing businesses already are within a reasonably short period of time because i mean since we re sort of mature products mature markets i mean this isn t some 10 year strategy if we can t get there in the next year or two i think you would be disappointed so that s how we try to evaluate things and come up with multiples but we re seeing more that are coming in that are available and sort of within the ranges that we think we can achieve that deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s very helpful color can you update us on what type of debt to ebitda leverage you re comfortable with at this time when it comes to doing a deal dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer we re fairly conservative certainly i mean all of our borrowing is sort of unsecured and very low covenant covenant light and usually 3 times 3 5 times leverage multiples we can maintain that i mean if you go above that i think you had a little more restrictions and all like this but even within that we can do 300 million or 400 million worth of that kind of with our ebitda and the ebitda what the acquisition target brings like i said 300 million or 400 million i d be glad i d love to find something at that range that we could buy and we probably even be willing to do more than that but if we did more than that we d probably want to do more of a combination of debt and equity rather than and all that just because again we re fairly conservative thinking and we want to have inaudible just because we do an acquisition that mean we re out of the acquisition market for a while we want to continue to be active in there so like i said even with conservative leverage 3 times 3 5 times that gives us more than enough capacity to do anything we re looking at right now deforest hinman walthausen co analyst thank you once again helpful color and then just update us on the outlook for share repurchases given the authorization indeed how you balance potential share repurchases with potential deals dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think the share repurchases are fairly like i said we re not trying to do a big share repurchase we re just trying to avoid the steady creep in our stock due to other things like stock options so we re not doing a lot and i don t see that being affected since the amount we re doing i mean the total amount we said we d buy was over a multi year period so in any one year we re not doing a lot and i don t see that going to be that would be affected by acquisitions or any other thing i mean if we still raise our dividend even with the stock repurchase i don t see that being affected by anything else we re doing like i said we re very conservatively financed conservative financial structure and like i said nothing we re going to that going to either way would inhibit us from doing that program deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay thank you that s all my questions dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director thank you deforest operator all right thank you operator instructions and our next question will come from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions i was wondering what the backlog looks like organically so excluding dutch power percentage wise dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think i said that 2 6 year over year ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes organically the backlog was up another 2 6 with dutch power it was up by 8 4 joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and where could you just walk us through maybe some of the strengths and weaknesses within the backlog because that does sort of project the slowing from i think it was up 10 at the end of the fourth quarter dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer you know the slowing parts industrial was up ag was down a little bit actually europe without dutch power was off little but i mean i know in europe we worked against some very strong comparables last year so i mean backlog is important but as we said in some ways we don t want it to get too big because if it gets too far out we like to keep our deliveries fairly reasonable so i would say yes i like a little more backlog now in ag industrial is at a more than healthy level and i think europe is at a reasonable level for being able to maintain good lead times so like i said i think and as i said last year s first quarter was a little bit off in the sales it was actually very strong in bookings so i think backlog to me is at a healthy level other than like i said a little bit more in ag joe mondillo sidoti company analyst great and backlog is only about a quarter s worth the revenue right so it s not you get a lot of bookings in the quarter and ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director and it s a little bit more than that because you remember our 20 of our sales are aftermarket parts and those don t really flow through the backlog number dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right okay good point okay all right and then at the european segment i was surprised to see certainly beat my expectations on the growth excluding currency i know you had some supplier constraint issues at the end of last year and some issues over there was part of the growth some timing that because of supplier constraints and any other issues that you were seeing over in that french operations or even in the uk too maybe was that things were just a timing issue and just pushed in the first quarter and then going forward not to expect that kind of growth going forward can you just talk about how why that was so strong dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer well no i mean the issues were worst in the third quarter and like i said i think we had solved most of those by the fourth quarter i like said in france we still got a little bit of low margin backlog in one of our units but yes i think i mean we ve been helped in europe by some new product introductions i mentioned the robo cut at our mcconnel unit in england and so i think uk group actually has done quite nicely i think there was a little bit of slowing i think in the overall european economy more on the continent i think uk we still got this brexit overhang and i think part of that actually the orders have been coming pretty smoothly even with brexit but they re not coming in advance i mean people are they are ordering kind of day to day stuff pretty regularly but they re not doing some of the big pre season order likes maybe they ve done in years past because they don t want to order and some of that s is going to be delivered next month they don t want to order some that s going to be delivered six months when they don t know what the tariff rate between england and france are going to be and this type of stuff so that s still a bit of an overhang and i m kind of disappointed they just keep kicking the can down the road i think i had this big deadline end of march and one in the middle of april and now it s one october but i m kind of losing track of these important deadlines but so all in all like i said i think our uk group is certainly doing better but our french group is actually like say is actually up a little too even though they got a little bit low margin backlog and i think we re really pleased the dutch power like i said we ve been kind of disappointed with the lack of acquisition activity in europe last couple of years but this is a good one that really fits nicely with us and i think we ll be able to do somewhat throughout some of the rest of our distribution so yes actually europe is holding up reasonably well for us and like say it would be a little bit more evident if it wasn t for currency joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right two more questions on the i was just wondering what your sort of outlook related to investing in the rental fleet and could you talk about sort of utilization rates and sort of demand that you re seeing overall there ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes i mean our demand and utilization rates are holding up at or above our expectations at our units like we got two new inaudible weakest are the two newest because we re still just building up the fleet there we added two branches there last year and due to constraints on production we actually had not fully staffed those from a product point of view and so like say we do have some internally pent up demand to get our equipment that all of our units especially the two newer ones so that continuing to drive that and utilization rates are holding up at or above our expectations and we ll probably open another branch as well this year as we continue which like say we ll consume product just setting up another branch too so that seems to be progressing at a healthy pace and joe we re also we expect to be higher than we are at the end of the q1 our expectations were at 49 million we want to grow more than that in the equipment and the rental fleet right joe mondillo sidoti company analyst all right well that actually does it for me dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thanks joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst thanks operator all right thank you and at this time there are no further questions in the queue so i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer

after watching donald trump win the presidency in 2016 with promises of unfinanced tax cuts defense spending increases and yet to be seen trillions of dollars for infrastructure projects the democratic party is in no mood to take up fiscal restraint instead the candidates competing to take on trump in 2020 are trying to outdo each other with promises of sweeping new federal benefits and spending programs with only the very rich on the hook for higher taxes two of the democratic party s respected economists jason furman and larry summers seemed to lend their voices to this new direction for fiscal policy in an essay in foreign affairs their message at least at first glance was that deficit worries are overblown and should not stand in the way of a new era of government activism to combat inequality climate change and other social ills in other words they seemed to side with democratic party activists who say there s no harm in widening budget deficits now if the result is a higher standard of living and more security for those with the lowest incomes furman and summers were bolstered in their argument by olivier blanchard former chief economist of the international monetary fund imf who dedicated his address as outgoing president of the american economic association to the subject of deficits and debt in an era of ultra low real interest rates blanchard observed that nations with real economic growth exceeding the real rate of interest can run larger deficits than in previous eras because interest on the debt will not push annual borrowing to unsustainable levels his argument came with conditions most importantly that a nation would need to run something close to balance in the primary budget which excludes interest payments on accumulated debt for the annual deficits not to become a major problem all of this seemed to suggest that the democratic presidential candidates pushing for new unfinanced spending initiatives would have some credible economists bolstering their case but a closer reading of the furman summers article reveals a different position after much nodding and posturing regarding the urgent need to address poor health care and education for lower income households the authors endorse a rather conventional fiscal position pay as you go they want new federal spending to be offset with tax hikes or other spending reductions that pretty much rules out medicare for all to be sure a pay as you go framework would allow deficits to widen substantially over the coming years based on current law but at least it would prevent elected leaders from making the problem worse the congressional budget office cbo projects the primary budget deficit will widen from 1 4 percent of gdp in 2029 to an average of 3 1 percent of gdp over the ten year period 2039 to 2048 in 2048 federal debt will have climbed to 152 percent of gdp up from 78 percent this year recently furman and summers issued a clarification to their earlier essay and moved even further away from a fiscal expansion posture the two now suggest that in addition to paying for new spending a responsible fiscal position would need to close the financing gaps in the social security and medicare hospital insurance hi trust funds with a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts they would prevent using the savings from a trust fund rescue package to finance other federal spending which means the added revenue and lower spending in social security and medicare would reduce the government s overall budget deficit as it happens the boards of trustees for social security and medicare have just issued their annual reports they show both program s trust funds headed toward insolvency soon eliminating the combined social security and medicare hi trust fund deficit would require tax hikes and spending cuts equal to about 1 3 percent of gdp over seventy five years thus if implemented soon the furman summers proposal would lower projected deficits over the next decade expected to be 4 4 percent of gdp by about one third which is substantial in dollar terms that s equivalent to more than 3 trillion and unless they change the character of social security by adopting highly progressive taxation some of that deficit reduction would involve real sacrifices by middle income households the furman summers essays leave an impression of conflicted instincts on the one hand they don t want to be viewed as throwing cold water on democratic spending ambitions indeed they go out of their way to create the impression that they favor moving aggressively in the same direction as party activists on the other hand they realize that abandoning all fiscal restraint is the wrong policy in the short run of course fiscal expansion will boost economic growth but the u s economy is already at full employment and still growing at a strong pace there s no justification for fiscal stimulus in the short run indeed widening the deficit now would only make it harder to run larger deficits when the economy really does soften or fall into recession further over the medium and long run there s no credible evidence suggesting countries with high accumulated debt do better than those which manage their finances more prudently in fact there s strong evidence pointing in the opposite direction one recent study of advanced economies found periods with high levels of public and private debt slow economic growth by as much as 1 percentage point annually cbo and other forecasters build into their models lower long term growth from higher accumulated levels of public debt the u s is running large deficits today and accumulating debt at a rapid pace the federal government will soon be paying substantial amounts annually just to service the accumulated debt even with low interest rates this is all occurring while the economy is quite strong now is the right time for sensible medium and long term fiscal consolidation not expansion furman and summers certainly know this which is probably why they call for deficit reduction even as they create the impression that they favor something else
formation forms of vehicle what legal form of vehicle is typically used for private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction does such a vehicle have a separate legal personality or existence under the law of your jurisdiction in either case what are the legal consequences for investors and the manager the two most common legal vehicles in use within the united kingdom uk for private equity funds are english limited partnerships elps and scottish limited partnership slps formed pursuant to the limited partnerships act 1907 as amended lpa 1907 the elp and slp differ in certain key respects including separate legal personality governing law and place of establishment while slps because of having separate legal personality are commonly used vehicles for fund of funds carried interest and feeder funds elps are the predominant uk private investment fund vehicle accordingly this chapter focuses on elps an elp is a partnership registered in accordance with the lpa 1907 and is subject to english partnership law which includes the partnership act 1890 pa 1890 and the rules of equity and english common law applicable to ordinary general partnerships to the extent not modified to the contrary by an agreement between the partners an elp must have at least one general partner gp and one limited partner lp to avoid being a qualifying partnership for the purpose of the companies and partnerships accounts and audit regulations and being subject to the requirement to file accounts with companies house in the same way companies do under such regulations it is becoming more common to see elps with a second non corporate gp such as a limited liability partnership an elp unlike an slp does not possess separate legal personality and is not an incorporated entity or a body corporate the elp is thus incapable of contracting in its own name or holding property in its own right instead legal title to the property of an elp is held on trust by its gp or a nominee company the gp is responsible for managing the business of the elp and contracts on behalf of the elp the gp may be a natural or corporate person an lp s liability for the debts and obligations of the elp is limited to the amount of the capital it contributes to the elp whereas the gp s liability for the debts and obligations of the elp is unlimited accordingly uk gps of elps are typically corporate vehicles that shield their members from liability to third parties in april 2017 the legislative reform private fund limited partnerships order 2017 the lro introduced a sub category of elps private fund limited partnerships pflps and amended the lpa 1907 as it applies to pflps and to partners in pflps the pflp structure is designed to reduce some of the administrative and financial burdens that have had an impact on private funds using the elp structure and it aims to make the uk an attractive and competitive domicile to private fund sponsors an elp may only be designated as a pflp if it is constituted by an agreement in writing and is a collective investment scheme as defined in section 235 of the financial services and markets act 2000 fsma these two criteria are referred to herein as the private fund conditions in this chapter references to elp includes references to a limited partnership that is a pflp unless otherwise stated see questions 2 and 5 for further detail on pflps forming a private equity fund vehicle what is the process for forming a private equity fund vehicle in your jurisdiction an elp is a partnership vehicle registered in accordance with the lpa 1907 and is formed between two or more persons at a minimum the gp and a single lp who agree to carry on a business in common with a view to achieving a profit there is no prescribed form that an agreement of limited partnership must take nor is there a requirement for the document to be filed at companies house indeed there is no requirement for a limited partnership agreement an lpa to be written down an lpa can be a verbal contract however given that the lpa 1907 and pa 1890 each contain default provisions which in the absence of an agreement between the partners to the contrary will be deemed to govern their relationship the vast majority of commercial elps are governed by prescriptive documented lpas that contain contractually agreed terms between the relevant parties an elp must be registered at companies house using an application for registration of a limited partnership on form lp5 to obtain the limited liability status conferred by the lpa 1907 the application for registration mandates that certain information be provided including a description of the general nature of the business the name of the partnership the principal place of business of the partnership the full name of each of the general and limited partners the amount of the capital contributed by each limited partner as capital to the partnership and the form of contribution ie whether it is paid in cash or otherwise the partnership s proposed term if any the date of the elp s commencement and a statement that the partnership is an elp and thus the liability of its lps is limited form lp5 needs to be signed or otherwise authenticated by or on behalf of each of the general and initial limited partners and dated the form along with a registration fee of as at the date of publication 20 or 100 where same day registration is required is to be sent to the registrar of companies the registrar for the part of the uk in which the principal place of the elp s business is to be situated ie england or wales where any changes to the information supplied via form lp5 arise the elp must provide the register with a statement on form lp6 specifying the nature of the changes within seven days of the changes occurring there is no cost associated with notifying the register of such a change however failure to notify will result in the gp being liable to a daily default fine of as at the date of publication 1 for the duration of the default there is also an obligation to advertise in the london gazette the gazette when an lp becomes a gp or an lp assigns its interest in the elp these changes will only become effective once the advertisement has been made once an elp is registered the registrar will issue a certificate of registration this certificate includes the elp s name and registration number and represents conclusive evidence that the elp came into existence on the date of registration a register of elps is maintained by the registrar a pflp can be registered at companies house using form lp7 the information required to complete the application for registration is the same as that for an elp except that unlike in a form lp5 pflps do not have to register the nature of the partnership business the amount of each limited partner s capital contribution and the term of the pflp form lp7 also includes a confirmation that the partnership meets the private fund conditions once registered as a pflp the registrar will issue either a certificate of registration and a certificate of designation as a pflp or a combined certificate instead of two separate certificates an existing elp may choose to apply for pflp status by providing certain information on form lp8 including the name of the partnership the principal place of business of the partnership and the name and signature of each general partner to confirm that the partnership meets the private fund conditions as described in question 1 once designated the registrar will issue a certificate designation that is conclusive evidence that the pflp was designated on the date stated in the certificate an elp that becomes a pflp will not be able to return to elp status as it may not satisfy the aforementioned criteria for an elp with respect to declaration and contribution of capital changes to the form lp7 or form lp8 must be notified in the same manner as changes to a form lp5 with the exception that pflps are not required to advertise changes in the gp or lp composition except for the case of a gp becoming an lp where the requirement remains with the gazette in december 2018 the department for business energy and industrial strategy published its response the response to comments received on its april 2018 consultation paper on reform of limited partnership law the consultation which sought views on ways in which the law might be modernised and on how the risk of misuse of limited partnerships can be limited the response outlines the government s intention to expand the information currently required of limited partnerships on applications for registration to include contact information for all limited and general partners the date of birth and nationality of all limited and general partners that are natural persons and also a standard industrial classification code identifying the limited partnership s business any changes to the information listed in the foregoing sentence will also have to be registered and confirmed in a confirmation statement see question 3 for further detail the government intends to introduce a transitional period and mechanism to enable all existing uk limited partnerships to submit the additional information the government also intends to request information upon application about a limited partnership s connection to the uk by retaining a principal place of business in the uk continuing some legitimate business activity in the uk or having a service address in the uk with an agent that is registered with an aml supervisory body in the response the government also indicated its intention to make it mandatory for presenters of new applications for registration of limi ted partnerships to demonstrate that they are registered with an aml supervisory body and to provide evidence of this on the application form requirements is a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction required to maintain locally a custodian or administrator a registered office books and records or a corporate secretary and how is that requirement typically satisfied an elp must have a principal place of business in england or wales at the time of its initial registration under the lpa 1907 this is usually achieved by having a uk based gp following initial registration there appears to be no obligation on the elp to maintain a connection with the uk or conduct business in the uk consequently a number of elps retire their initial english gp and have foreign gps in the consultation the government sets out its belief that it is vital for limi ted partnerships registered in the uk to maintain some demonstrable link to the uk the response outlines the government s intention to request information about an elp s connection to the uk upon application for registration see question 2 and on an ongoing basis any change in an elp s principal place of business or the way in which it demonstrates its ongoing connection to the uk will be required to be notified to the registrar the financial conduct authority fca confirmed that an elp s principal place of business is regarded as the equivalent of a registered office when determining whether an elp is established in the uk for the purposes of directive 2011 6 eu on alternative investment fund managers the aifmd the lpa 1907 does not expressly require elps to prepare accounts and the obligations on the partners contained in the pa 1890 to render true accounts and full information on all things affecting the partnership to any partner are subject to any agreement between the partners to the contrary typically the form and contents of the elps financial statements are provided for in the lpa unless the elp is a qualifying partnership under the companies and partnerships accounts and audit regulations 2013 the accounts regulations the elp is not required to file a copy of its accounts with companies house subject to any contrary agreement between the partners the pa 1890 requires the books of the partnership to be kept at the partnership s place of business or at its principal place of business if it has more than one in the consultation the government expressed interest in views on whether there is a case for all limited partnerships to be required to prepare accounts and reports in line with the requirements for private companies based on the evidence submitted the response notes that the government does not consider the case has been made for this requirement however it intends to introduce a requirement for all limited partnerships to file a confirmation statement at least every 12 months for the purpose of confirming all details on the register are correct a requirement that is already mandatory for slps an elp is not required to appoint a local secretary or local service providers such as an administrator or custodian unless the elp is an alternative investment fund an aif as defined under the aifmd and its alternative investment fund manager aifm as defined under and for the purposes of the aifmd is an eu full scope aifm in which case its aifm is required to be authorised under the aifmd and comply with all substantive requirements under the aifmd including the requirement to ensure that the elp appoints an independent depositary from a list of permissible types of firms or institutions who shall be established in the same european economic area eea member state as the eea aif although until 22 july 2017 regulators had the discretion to allow such depositary to be established in another eea member state the aifmd depositary shall perform specific functions and shall have certain responsibilities pursuant to the aifmd a depo lite may also be required by regulators in certain eea member states such as germany and denmark when a non eea aifm registers in such eea member states for marketing purposes under article 42 aifmd access to information what access to information about a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction is the public granted by law how is it accessed if applicable what are the consequences of failing to make such information available members of the public can access and request copies of information filed with the registrar including forms lp5 and lp7 for registering a limited partnership and lp6 and lp8 for making changes to a limited partnership as noted in question 2 changes to the partner composition of an elp must be notified to the registrar an elp that qualifies as an aif and is managed by an eea aifm or marketed in the eea by a non eea aifm will be subject to certain reporting to the relevant regulator the eea regulator where the eea aifm is authorised or in the case of a non eea aifm where a non eea aifm is registered for marketing purposes although information filed with the fca for authorisation and registration purposes must generally be kept confidential subject to limited statutory exceptions certain eea regulators may give access to certain information filed for registration purposes since april 2016 certain uk legal entities are obliged to maintain a register of persons with significant control a psc register although this obligation does not apply to elps slps are required to maintain a psc register that is accessible to the public with effect from 1 january 2016 uk financial institutions as defined for the purposes of the oecd s common reporting standard crs and so including many elp fund vehicles are required to undertake due diligence on their investors and account holders and from january 2017 to report such information to the uk tax authorities hmrc the information is exchanged with tax authorities in other countries and enables the uk to meet its obligations under bilateral information exchange agreements that implement the crs implementation of the crs has also occurred in a number of other jurisdictions although the us has not yet implemented the rules as of november 2018 the uk had automatic exchange relationships with over 60 jurisdictions council directive eu 2018 822 amending directive 2011 16 eu dac 6 which came into force on 25 june 2018 imposes obligations on eu intermediaries including among others law firms accounting firms and banks and in some cases taxpayers to disclose certain information on cross border transactions to the relevant tax authority if certain hallmarks are met the scope of dac 6 is extremely broad and it is anticipated that it will require disclosure of a wide range of arrangements at present there is uncertainty as to how the rules will apply including how they will apply to transactions involving private equity funds each eu member state must implement dac 6 into domestic law by the end of 2019 the first disclosures under dac 6 will be required in 2020 applying to any reportable arrangements taking place on or after 25 june 2018 limited liability for third party investors in what circumstances would the limited liability of third party investors in a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction not be respected as a matter of local law the lpa 1907 provides that an lp who takes part in the management of the business of an elp will lose its limited liability and will become liable for the debts of the partnership during the period of their involvement as a gp an lp may at any time without forfeiting its limited liability inspect the elp s books and may examine the state of the business and may advise with other partners on such matters in contrast to limited partnership legislation in other jurisdictions such as jersey and guernsey the lpa 1907 does not specify which activities will not constitute an lp s participation in the management of the business of the limited partnership care needs to be taken when considering the lp s rights under the lpa and participation by lps in advisory committees to ensure that the lp does not fall within the scope of management especially in the context of lps having a representative on an elp s advisory committee lps will typically ask the gp s legal counsel to provide a legal opinion stating that the lp s participation as an lp pursuant to the applicable lpa and as the case may be its representative participation as a member of the advisory committee will not endanger such lp s limited liability the lro helpfully contains a non exhaustive white list of activities that an lp in a pflp may undertake without being considered to take part in the management of the business and therefore without losing its limited liability such as taking part in a decision about the variation of or waiver of a term of the partnership whether the general nature of the partnership business should change whether a person should become or cease to be a partner and whether the partnership should end or the term of the partnership should be extended appointing a person to wind up the partnership reviewing or approving a valuation of the partnership s assets discussing the prospects of the partnership business consulting or advising with a general partner or any person appointed to manage or advise the partnership about the affairs of the partnership or about its accounts taking part in a decision regarding changes in the persons respon sible for the day to day management of the partnership appointing or nominating a person to represent the limited partner on a committee authorising such a person to take any action in that capacity that would not involve taking part in the management of the partnership business if taken by the limited partner or revoking such an appointment or nomination and taking part in a decision approving or authorising an action proposed to be taken by a general partner or another person appointed to manage the partnership including in particular a proposal in relation to the disposal of all or part of the partnership business or the acquisition of another business by the partnership the acquisition or disposal of a type of investment or a particular investment by the partnership the exercise of the partnership s rights in respect of an investment the participation by a limited partner in a particular investment by the partnership and the incurring extension variation or discharge of debt by the partnership the government has indicated that the white list is intended to cover in particular employees of the gp who are invested in the pflp themselves as lps and institutional or high net worth investors who take a strong interest in the fund including lps who are on an lp advisory committee the white list is not exhaustive and the creation of the white list does not mean that the activities on the list are permissible for lps by right the white list also does not intend to enable limited partners in pflps to carry out activities that would otherwise not be permitted under the lpa in contrast to the limited partnership legislation of other typical fund formation jurisdictions such as jersey and the cayman islands the lpa 1907 does not permit a partner to draw out or have its capital returned to it during the lifetime of the elp a partner that draws out or receives back a part of its capital shall be liable for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership up to the amount so drawn out or received back the effect of this provision is that the partner potentially remains liable to recontribute to the partnership an amount up to the amount of the capital withdrawn clearly this prohibition on returning capital to partners during the life of an elp is impractical in the context of a private equity fund the fund needs to be able to distribute the proceeds of investments consequently a partner s commitment to an elp is typically structured such that amounts contributed by partners are separately classified as an initial capital contribution typically a nominal sum made upon admission to the elp which will not be returned until the elp is dissolved with the remainder of a partner s commitment being structured as an advance or loan to the elp which is subsequently drawn down by the gp as and when needed to fund investments and partnership expenses and is repaid to the partners from the proceeds generated by investments this split of a partner s commitment into capital and loan advances represents an idiosyncrasy unique to uk partnership law the government recognised that this restriction on the return of a partner s capital contribution creates unnecessary complexity and impracticality in the context of private equity fund structuring as such under the lro an lp of a pflp is not required to make a capital contribution though the option will remain for example there may be tax or regulatory advantages in other jurisdictions capital that is contributed to a pflp is withdrawable and there is no requirement to declare capital contributions to the registrar where a limited partnership was formed before the implementation of the lro capital contributed before any redesignation as a pflp will be treated as under the former regime capital contributed after the limited partnership is redesignated will then be treated in accordance with the new regime fund manager s fiduciary duties what are the fiduciary duties owed to a private equity fund formed in your jurisdiction and its third party investors by that fund s manager or other similar control party or fiduciary under the laws of your jurisdiction and to what extent can those fiduciary duties be modified by agreement of the parties the concept that every partner in a partnership owes a duty of good faith is a cornerstone of the english law on partnerships and applies equally to partners in an elp as to partners in an ordinary partnership subject to any agreement to the contrary a non partner manager of an elp who exercises discretionary management functions will also owe fiduciary duties to the partners of the elp the courts have found that in addition to any specific contractual obligations owed there is an overarching duty to act in good faith and to act in a fair and honest manner with your partners gps are under an obligation to act in the best interests of the elp where a gp has not obtained the prior permission of its partners it must account for any benefit derived from an transaction involving the partnership and must not act in a manner which is contrary to the best interests of the partnership including obtaining a secret profit of personal advantage or allowing its interests to conflict with duties owed to his or her partners lps in elps have a duty to render accounts and account for profit from competing businesses although this duty is typically disapplied in the lpa lps in pflps do not have the same duty the scope of certain fiduciary duties may be modified or potentially even excluded under english law it is unclear however whether fiduciary duties can be completely excluded under english law such a limitation or exclusion must be within the limits imposed under the common law and under relevant legislation in any event it is likely to be commercially unacceptable to lps for a gp to attempt to exclude fiduciary duties certain duties such as the duty to act honestly and in good faith are considered inherent within english partnership law moreover it is not possible under english law to exclude liability for deliberate breach of fiduciary duty fraud or bad faith the gp of an internally managed elp or the external aifm of an elp who is authorised in an eea member state as an aifm will also have to comply with the specific duties applicable to it under the aifmd including the duty to act honestly with due skill care and diligence and fairly the duty to act in the best interests of the aif or the investors of the aif they manage and the integrity of the market the duty to employ effectively the resources and procedures that are necessary for the proper performance of their business activities the duties to treat all aif investors fairly disclose preferential treatments and take all reasonable steps to avoid conflicts of interest gross negligence does your jurisdiction recognise a gross negligence as opposed to ordinary negligence standard of liability applicable to the management of a private equity fund under english law there is no recognised concept of gross negligence as distinct from ordinary negligence the concept typically arises in contractual drafting whereby the gp will seek to limit or exclude liability to the partnership for losses arising as a result of the gp s ordinary negligence and lps will seek to ensure that the indemnity granted to the gp any fund manager or any of their respective affiliates for losses or damages caused as a result of their actions does not extend to gross negligence gross negligence implies a level of severity greater than ordinary negligence and modern case law indicates that where a contract expressly refers to gross negligence the courts of england and wales will typically seek to understand the parties intention behind the use of the term gross negligence as distinct from ordinary negligence the term is a matter of interpretation and its meaning will depend each time on the wording and context of the contract as a whole the courts have thus far not provided a definitive determination of the concept of gross negligence under contract law as distinct from negligence however it has previously been found that gross negligence is clearly intended to represent something more fundamental than failure to exercise proper skill certain practitioners have sought to include a specific definition of gross negligence within certain contractual documentation governed by english law or have sought to define the concept by reference to the meaning given under the law of a foreign jurisdiction such as the law of the state of delaware other special issues or requirements are there any other special issues or requirements particular to private equity fund vehicles formed in your jurisdiction is conversion or redomiciling to vehicles in your jurisdiction permitted if so in converting or redomiciling limited partnerships formed in other jurisdictions into limited partnerships in your jurisdiction what are the most material terms that typically must be modified the legislation underpinning elps the lpa 1907 and the pa 1890 does not provide for the conversion of a foreign fund into an elp practically such conversion would have to be effected by the creation of a new elp and the transfer or contribution of assets from the existing foreign fund to the gp of the elp or a nominee in each case to hold on trust for the elp given the elp s absence of separate legal personality the vast majority of terms governing an elp can be determined contractually by the parties through a documented and prescriptive lpa given the limited statutory application to elps an elp can be established on substantially the same terms as those applying to foreign limited partnerships notwithstanding the above there are certain idiosyncrasies in the lpa 1907 that are not found in equivalent foreign limited partnership legislation such quirks will need to be accommodated in the lpa of an elp for instance as noted above the prohibitions on returning capital to partners during the life of an elp excluding pflps contained in the lpa 1907 leads to a bifurcation of a partner s commitment to an elp into a small nominal capital contribution and a much larger loan that is advanced to the partnership secondly for certain tax purposes elps have in the past typically been structured so that the gp receives a priority profit share that is then on paid to the fund manager rather than the fund manager receiving a management fee from the elp see questions 21 and 23 for further information and reasons why this arrangement may now become less common fund sponsor bankruptcy or change of control with respect to institutional sponsors of private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction what are some of the primary legal and regulatory consequences and other key issues for the private equity fund and its general partner and investment adviser arising out of a bankruptcy insolvency change of control restructuring or similar transaction of the private equity fund s sponsor under the lpa 1907 the death or bankruptcy of an lp will not cause the automatic dissolution of an elp insolvency or winding up provisions are commonly included in the lpa to provide for an orderly dissolution of an elp if the gp becomes insolvent many lpas give lps the ability to appoint a new gp or terminate the elp given that gps have unlimited liability for the debts of an elp under lpa 1907 elps are typically structured so that the gp is a corporate vehicle with limited liability and the fund manager is a separate entity affiliated with the gp so as to prevent the fund manager being held liable for the debts of the elp a fund manager based in the uk that provides portfolio and risk management functions to funds qualifying as aifs is required to be authorised by the financial conduct authority the fca as an aifm pursuant to the aifmd a uk asset manager who is not acting as an aifm of the elp but provides advisory management or other regulated services as a sub adviser or delegate of the aifm or operates individual managed accounts will be required to be authorised by the fca under the markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii such authorised uk aifms and asset managers will also be subject to the uk statutory regime for change in control of uk authorised firms which is set out in part xii of fsma and supplemented by fca change in control rules these requirements require any person seeking to acquire control in a uk authorised aifm or asset manager to obtain the prior consent of the fca before doing so failure to obtain the fca s consent is a criminal offence control for these purposes broadly encompasses any acquisition of 10 per cent of shares or voting power or significant influence over the management of the aifm or asset manager the threshold may be 20 per cent for some aifms depending on the type of licence the application process requires the submission of detailed information and can take two to six months a change of control may also likely qualify as a material change to the conditions for initial authorisation of a uk aifm and require a specific notification with the fca regulation licensing and registration principal regulatory bodies what are the principal regulatory bodies that would have authority over a private equity fund and its manager in your jurisdiction and what are the regulators audit and inspection rights and managers regulatory reporting requirements to investors or regulators elps are not in and of themselves regulated entities instead the focus of uk fund regulation is on the fund manager as noted in question 9 uk based fund managers that provide portfolio and risk management functions to aifs are required to be authorised by the fca as aifms the aifmd imposes substantive regulatory obligations on aifms including rules relating to internal capital adequacy requirements regulatory and investor reporting ensuring that each aif it manages appoints a depositary and restrictions on remuneration of employees of the aifm among others as fca authorised and regulated entities uk aifms are subject to the fca s conduct of business rules and general fca principles of business including the requirement to deal with the fca in an open and cooperative manner there is a lighter aifmd regulatory regime for sub threshold aifms meaning aifms that manage portfolios of aifs which in aggregate do not exceed 100 million or in the case of aifs that are unleveraged and have no redemption rights exercisable within the first five years of the aif ie typical private equity funds 500 million to the extent an aifm manages assets on behalf of aifs that combine both these types of aif the aggregate threshold of 100 million should be applied when determining whether an aifm can be classified as a sub threshold aifm while sub threshold aifms do benefit from a lighter touch regulatory regime under the aifmd they are not able to take advantage of the aifmd marketing passport meaning that they have to comply with the individual national private placement regime npprs of each eea member state npprs are not uniformed across the eea member states and are particularly onerous in some of them for this reason many sub threshold aifms have decided to opt up to full scope aifm status aifms that operate individual managed accounts and provide related services such as investment advice will need additional permissions from the fca for these activities and are subject to additional regulatory requirements derived from mifid ii in connection with these activities depending on the aifm s regulatory classification additional regulatory requirements under mifid ii potentially include requirements to comply with provisions on transaction reporting transaction recording product governance trade transparency and client classification rules the fca relies heavily on authorised firms to provide information to it but reserves the right to visit inspect and evaluate the compliance of authorised firms typically through thematic reviews which focus on specific industries for instance asset management or retail banking or as part of its general supervisory remit the fca is also able to take action at a firm specific level where it has specific concerns about a particular regulated entity some larger or higher risk firms or both are also proactively supervised by the fca on a relationship managed basis while the fca is the primary regulator of uk based fund managers other regulators such as the prudential regulation authority pra may have regulatory oversight of certain large investment firms that pose prudential risks to the economy aifms that are part of the same group as these entities or banks may be subject to prudential supervision on a consolidated basis by the pra governmental requirements what are the governmental approval licensing or registration requirements applicable to a private equity fund in your jurisdiction does it make a difference whether there are significant investment activities in your jurisdiction an fca authorised aifm must notify the fca of its intention to market an elp to investors domiciled or with a registered office in the uk if such aifm wishes to market an elp on a cross border basis into other eea member states under the aifmd marketing passport the aifm must notify the competent authority of the eea member states into which the aifm wishes to passport the elp and the fca will in turn transmit this information to the competent authorities of the relevant eea member states the aifmd marketing passport is not available to fca authorised aifms that manage aifs that are not registered in an eea member state for instance a cayman exempted limited partnership in this circumstance the fca authorised aifm will need to comply with each relevant eea member state s nppr where available in the same way that an aifm not based in an eea member state would be required to registration of investment adviser is a private equity fund s manager or any of its officers directors or control persons required to register as an investment adviser in your jurisdiction uk based entities providing portfolio and risk management to aifs are required to be authorised and regulated by the fca as aifms see question 10 authorisation as an aifm incorporates permission for the provision of investment advice in connection with the aifs for which the manager carries on portfolio and risk management functions provision of investment advice in connection with investments other than aifs managed by the aifm is a separate regulated activity as is the management of individual portfolio accounts entities carrying on portfolio management providing investment advice in relation to investments other than aifs managed by them or arranging deals in investments including funds other than in connection with aifs must be authorised by the fca to provide these services and regulated by the fca on an ongoing basis in compliance with the rules appli cable under mifid ii the process for becoming authorised by the fca either as an aifm or an asset manager is a lengthy and resource intensive exercise fca authorised entities are subject to a significant volume of rules including the fca principles for businesses and the fca s conduct of business rules the fca requires that persons proposing to carry out controlled functions on behalf of an fca authorised firm have to be fit and proper to carry out such functions such functions include acting as a chief executive director or partner money laundering reporting officer and chief compliance officer of an fca authorised firm such persons must be approved by the fca to perform the controlled functions in question and are subject on an ongoing basis to the fca s code of conduct for approved persons and the statement of principles for approved persons the fca needs to be satisfied that persons proposing to carry out controlled functions on behalf of an fca authorised firm have adequate knowledge and experience to carry out such functions in recent years the fca has placed special emphasis on the integrity and honesty of persons carrying out controlled functions within the financial services industry in a bid to improve the culture of regulated firms generally this has resulted in the implementation of new rules for senior management and other key staff within banks and it is anticipated that similar reforms will be implemented for aifms and other investment firms from 2019 fund manager requirements are there any specific qualifications or other requirements imposed on a private equity fund s manager or any of its officers directors or control persons in your jurisdiction see questions 10 and 12 political contributions describe any rules or policies of public pension plans or other governmental entities in your jurisdiction that restrict or require disclosure of political contributions by a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser or their employees there are no uk rules or regulations other than rules applicable generally in the uk in relation to political donations as well as general uk anti bribery laws that oblige a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser to disclose political contributions made by it use of intermediaries and lobbyist registration describe any rules or policies of public pension plans or other governmental entities in your jurisdiction that restrict or require disclosure by a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser of the engagement of placement agents lobbyists or other intermediaries in the marketing of the fund to public pension plans and other governmental entities describe any rules that require a fund s investment adviser or its employees and agents to register as lobbyists in the marketing of the fund to public pension plans and governmental entities there are no uk rules that restrict or oblige a private equity fund s manager or investment adviser to disclose the engagement of placement agents lobbyists or other intermediaries in the marketing of a private equity fund to public pension plans and other governmental entities although the fca may require details of placement agents and marketing activity as part of its supervisory remit in addition where an aifm seeks to market an aif to uk investors the fca s notification form for this purpose requires disclosure to the fca of the identity of any placement agents engaged to market the fund to uk investors in addition article 23 aifmd requires eea authorised aifms or non eea aifms marketing to eea investors to disclose certain information prior to closing including the identity of service providers which may include an appointed placement agent such disclosures are typically included in the private placement memorandum even when these requirements do not apply the fact that a placement agent has been engaged and the placement agent s identity is usually disclosed in the private placement memorandum of the relevant fund or separately disclosed to investors in responses to due diligence questionnaires these more detailed responses increasingly include detailed disclosure of the basis on which the placement agent or lobbyist is remunerated bank participation describe any legal or regulatory developments emerging from the recent global financial crisis that specifically affect banks with respect to investing in or sponsoring private equity funds since the financial crisis there have been a high number of legal and regulatory developments that may directly or indirectly affect banks ability or appetite for sponsoring or investing in private equity funds the eu prudential framework under the capital requirements directive and capital requirements regulation crd iv contains capital and liquidity requirements associated with fund investments which are potentially of direct relevance crd iv the fourth iteration of the eu s prudential framework rules was adopted in july 2013 and has applied since january 2014 crd iv aims to implement basel iii within the eu as well as eu specific reforms on remuneration and governance the rules under crd iv governing capital treatment of private equity investments are highly complex and depend upon among others the extent of the bank s participation in a particular fund and in funds generally as well as the type of fund the starting position is that private equity investments must be deducted from capital although this is subject to some limitations and more favourable capital treatment may in some cases be available for certain venture capital investments above certain participation thresholds private equity investments that are not deducted from capital must generally be risk weighted at 150 per cent under the standardised approach for less sophisticated banks or at 370 per cent or for sufficiently diversified funds 190 per cent under the internal ratings based approach for more sophisticated banks recent proposals from the eu authorities published in november 2016 indicate that the future capital treatment of risk weighted fund investments will depend increasingly on the types of underlying fund investments and the level of transparency for banks on the underlying investments crd iv also introduced quantitative requirements on liquidity which will impose a liquidity cost on banks holdings in funds for which commitments may be called within 30 days or less future changes to crd iv will also result in the implementation of quantitative requirements on leverage and stable funding anticipated to become effective from 2019 which may also result in increased costs associated with private equity investments a further issue for banks and the funds in which they invest is the potential for banks liabilities which could include liabilities to funds to be bailed in in the event that the bank becomes subject to a statutory resolution process under the bank recovery and resolution directive brrd this may include the write down or conversion into equity of banks unsecured liabilities article 55 of the brrd requires that liabilities within the scope of the brrd s bail in powers but governed by the law of a third country include a contractual term stating that the liability may be subject to write down and conversion powers of the relevant resolution authority in this case the bank of england carve outs may apply however for some liabilities where certain criteria including impracticability are met taxation tax obligations would a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction be subject to taxation there with respect to its income or gains would the fund be required to withhold taxes with respect to distributions to investors please describe what conditions if any apply to a private equity fund to qualify for applicable tax exemptions a private equity fund formed as an elp should not normally be treated as a separate taxable entity for uk tax purposes there should therefore be no uk withholding taxes on distributions to investors and the elp should not be subject to uk tax on income and gains from its investments instead for uk tax purposes investors in the fund should be regarded as holding their proportionate share of the fund s income and gains as determined in accordance with the fund s profit sharing arrangements uk taxable investors will be subject to uk tax on their allocations from the fund in accordance with their personal tax positions local taxation of non resident investors would non resident investors in a private equity fund be subject to taxation or return filing requirements in your jurisdiction generally speaking the investment strategy of most private equity funds is such that they should be regarded as carrying on an investment business rather than trading for uk tax purposes though the strategy of some funds is less clear in this regard provided the fund is regarded as investing rather than trading for uk tax purposes non uk resident investors should not except in relation to uk land see below be subject to uk tax on their proportionate share of income and gains of the fund unless the non uk resident investor holds its interest in the fund in connection with or for the purposes of a trade carried on by it in the uk through a uk branch agency or permanent establishment assuming that draft legislation in finance bill 2019 is enacted from 6 april 2019 non uk resident investors will be subject to uk capital gains tax or in the case of companies corporation tax on chargeable gains on the disposal of interests in uk land and the disposal of shares and certain other interests in property rich companies those that derive at least 75 per cent of their value from uk real estate where the person making the disposal holds or has held in the past two years a 25 per cent or greater interest in the company the taxable gain will be limited to the proportion of the gain arising from 6 april 2019 onwards unless the taxpayer elects otherwise the draft legislation also includes an exemption for gains arising from certain disposals of interests in uk property rich companies where the property is used for the purposes of a qualifying trade the draft legislation also contains a separate regime for uk property rich collective investment vehicles including real estate investment trusts collective investment schemes and alternative investment funds otherwise a non uk resident investor should only be subject to uk tax in respect of its participation in the fund to the extent of any uk tax deducted at source from uk source income such as interest if any received by the fund investors resident outside the uk may be entitled with regard to uk tax deducted from their apportioned share of any uk source income to the benefit of any double taxation agreement between their country of residence and the uk the fund may be required to file a uk partnership tax return and non uk resident investors will be required to provide basic details to the fund and register with the uk tax authorities in order to comply with any such requirement certain simplifications in respect of filing requirements were made in 2018 for returns from the 2018 19 tax year onwards partners need not provide a uk tax reference if they are not chargeable to uk tax in the relevant period the partnership did not carry on a trade profession or uk property business in the relevant period and the whole of the relevant period is one in which the partnership is required to report information about the partner under certain international information reporting regimes the finance act 2018 also included legislation intended to clarify certain other aspects of partnership taxation including legislation dealing with the situation where partnerships have partners that are themselves partnerships local tax authority ruling is it necessary or desirable to obtain a ruling from local tax authorities with respect to the tax treatment of a private equity fund vehicle formed in your jurisdiction are there any special tax rules relating to investors that are residents of your jurisdiction it is not typical for private equity funds or their participants to obtain rulings from hmrc in relation to their treatment there are no special rules applicable to investors in a uk private equity fund however it should be noted as discussed in question 21 that the uk government has introduced rules specifically focused on the taxation of carried interest holders and those who perform investment management services for the fund organisational taxes must any significant organisational taxes be paid with respect to private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction there are no such organisational taxes payable by elps special tax considerations please describe briefly what special tax considerations if any apply with respect to a private equity fund s sponsor carried interest arrangements for uk private equity sponsors have typically been structured using a carry limited partnership referred to as the carry lp often an slp which is admitted as an elp partner each participant s share of carried interest is delivered through an interest in the carry lp accordingly historically subject to points in relation to the taxation of employees mentioned below the uk taxation of participants in the carry lp generally followed that which would apply to any other uk resident investor in the fund the carry participants share of the fund s income and gains would be subject to uk income or capital gains tax according to the nature and character of the carried interest receipt ie whether it represented income such as dividends or interest or capital gains from investment realisations and the individuals personal circumstances however the uk tax landscape applicable to private equity fund executives has changed significantly in recent years in april 2015 the uk government introduced the disguised investment management fee rules which broadly speaking charge to tax as income everything arising to an individual who is providing investment management services in the uk to a collective investment scheme unless the amounts fall within legislative exemptions for carried interest or genuine arm s length co investment these changes were focused on structures designed to stream part of what was in effect the regular management fee from the fund to the management team so that it was received by individuals as a profit share from the underlying fund and so potentially subject to capital gains tax the highest marginal rate of which applicable to carried interest is currently 28 per cent as opposed to income tax the highest marginal rate of which is currently 45 per cent the rules are intended to ensure that management fee type remuneration received by fund managers in whatever form should be subject to income taxation for those elements of remuneration that remain subject to capital gains tax see above additional rules were introduced in july 2015 to remove the benefit of base cost shift this was an arrangement by which uk resident recipients of carried interest could broadly reduce the amount of their taxable capital gains by reference to costs borne economically by other investors furthermore for non domiciled uk tax residents the chargeable gain will now be treated as uk source to the extent the individual performs his or her investment management services for the relevant fund in the uk meaning that to the extent of their uk activities for that fund such persons may be subject to capital gains tax on carried interest whether or not remitted to the uk additionally in april 2016 the uk government introduced legislation the income based carried interest rules to restrict the capital gains tax treatment of carried interest and other performance linked rewards received by uk residents and other individuals performing investment management services in the uk through a uk permanent establishment this reflects a policy objective that capital gains tax treatment should be restricted to performance linked rewards arising from long term investment activity only under the new rules carried interest arising on or after 6 april 2016 can only be fully eligible for capital gains tax treatment where such treatment would otherwise be available if the average weighted holding period awhp of the investments by reference to which the carry is calculated exceeds 40 months if the awhp does not exceed 36 months all of the carried interest will be treated as income based carried interest subject to income tax and self employed individuals national insurance contributions if the awhp is between 36 and 40 months a graded scale of eligibility for capital gains tax treatment will apply complex rules apply the awhp test differently in certain circumstances including in relation to direct lending funds funds that invest in controlling and significant stakes of unquoted trading businesses venture capital and real estate funds and in respect of carried interest arising in the early years of the fund carry participants who are employees or members of a uk limited liability partnership llp who are regarded as employees for uk tax purposes are generally subject to the uk s employment related securities regime in respect of their carried interest under these rules charges to uk income tax and national insurance contributions can arise if the amount paid for the carried interest is less than its unrestricted market value at the time of its acquisition ie ignoring restrictions placed on the interest the british private equity and venture capital association bvca and hmrc have however agreed a memorandum of understanding mou with respect to the application of these rules to carried interest if the carried interest arrangements relating to the fund are consistent with those in the mou hmrc will accept that the unrestricted market value of the carried interest acquired by an employed participant is equal to the amount actually paid for such interest often nominal assuming the interest is acquired on formation of the fund such participants should not then be subject to employment income taxation on the acquisition of the carried interest or in respect of their returns where owing to the particular carry arrangements the mou is not thought to provide sufficient comfort participants can also make a joint tax election with their employer known as a section 431 election the broad effect of which is to ensure future carry returns should not be subject to employment income taxation employed carried interest participants are outside the current scope of the income based carried interest rules discussed above those involved in the structuring of fund sponsor incentives should also be alive to the two partnership anti avoidance regimes introduced by the uk government in 2014 namely the llp salaried member rules and the legislation concerning the allocation of profits and losses in partnerships with mixed individual and non individual members one other recent consideration for some uk general partners relates to the fact that they are often loss making in the early years of a fund when their management fee expense exceeds the income generated through their profit share those losses have traditionally been useful in sheltering tax in later years when the profit share from the fund exceeds management fees however under rules having effect from april 2017 there is a restriction on the set off of carried forward losses permitting them only to be set against 50 per cent of total profits exceeding an annual allowance of 5 million the uk government has confirmed following discussion between the bvca and hmrc on the impact of these provisions on uk general partners that no exclusion from the restrictions for the losses of uk general partners will be introduced a possible workaround the bvca has identified for new funds or existing funds that are able to reorganise their structure for future years is that if the elp itself were to appoint the manager and pay the management fee directly to the manager with the uk general partner not receiving a priority profit share the uk general partner would no longer make profits or losses to which the rules would apply but note the vat consequences discussed in question 23 tax treaties please list any relevant tax treaties to which your jurisdiction is a party and how such treaties apply to the fund vehicle in relation to the fund itself an elp is not typically able to rely on uk tax treaties as it is not a taxable entity for uk tax purposes the uk does however have an extensive network of tax treaties with various jurisdictions that may be relevant in relation to downstream investment structuring including in relation to assets that generate uk source income the availability of treaty relief for entities owned by investment funds should however be considered in light of the amendments to double tax treaties to be introduced by the oecd s multilateral instrument discussed in question 23 other significant tax issues are there any other significant tax issues relating to private equity funds organised in your jurisdiction typically in the uk private equity funds do not qualify as special investment funds the management of which is exempt from vat investment management and if applicable advisory fees may therefore be chargeable to uk vat at 20 per cent however as discussed above elps have in the past generally been structured so that the gp receives a priority profit share not subject to vat on first principles rather than a management fee with a separate investment manager receiving a management or advisory fee that is paid out of the gp s profit share though see the discussion of the restrictions on carried forward losses introduced in april 2017 in question 21 funds with a uk general partner may now wish to have the elp itself paying a management fee with the uk general partner not receiving a priority profit share the elp is typically then organised with a gp in an offshore jurisdiction such as delaware or jersey so that such fee may be paid outside the scope of vat or alternatively the uk fund manager and its uk subsidiary acting as the gp of the fund form a vat group with the result that there is no supply between those entities for vat purposes where the offshore gp route is followed it is of course necessary to maintain sufficient substance in the chosen jurisdiction and to consider the gp structure in light of the accounts regulations see question 3 where a uk general partner receives no priority profit share and the management fee is instead paid directly by the elp see the discussion of the restrictions on carried forward losses in question 21 that fee would be subject to vat unless the elp and the manager are in the same vat group and as a result there is no supply between those entities for vat purposes in certain circumstances a written instrument of transfer relating to an interest in an elp may be subject to uk stamp duty where the interest is being transferred by way of sale the amount of stamp duty payable should be limited to 0 5 per cent of the market value of any stock or marketable securities held by the fund readers may be aware that the global tax landscape is in a state of change in light of the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting beps project the uk government has already implemented uk laws designed to address certain practices that form the subject of the project such as the diverted profits tax the hybrid mismatch rules and a limit on corporate interest expense deductions in november 2016 the oecd also published a multilateral instrument mli designed to enable all oecd countries to meet the treaty related minimum standards that were agreed as part of the final beps package including changes to the manner in which the entitlement to benefit from double tax treaties is determined and permanent establishments are recognised the mli has now been signed by at least 80 countries and entered into force in the uk on 1 october 2018 the mli has effect in relation to a particular treaty where it has also come into force for the other country which is party to the treaty and will apply to these treaties with effect from january 2019 for withholding taxes and april 2019 for corporation tax income tax and capital gains tax it will be important to consider the mli and other beps related legal changes in relation to both fund and downstream investment structuring and management also of note for funds investing in the uk are some changes that have been made to the uk s participation exemption for the sale of substantial shareholdings the sse the changes include relaxation of the sse rules where the uk entity making the disposal is owned directly or indirectly by qualifying institutional investors including pension schemes sovereign wealth funds and certain uk authorised and retail funds a further tax related law in the uk that funds and their portfolio companies need to be aware of and react to is the introduction from the end of september 2017 of new criminal offences for failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion the new law can expose uk companies and partnerships and some non uk companies and partnerships to unlimited fines and ancillary orders such as confiscation orders if their employees agents and some service providers criminally facilitate uk or non uk tax evasion while acting in their capacity as employee agent or service provider since the offences are strict liability in nature ie they do not require any knowledge or intention it will be important to ensure that steps are taken to access the defence of having reasonable prevention measures in place selling restrictions and investors generally legal and regulatory restrictions describe the principal legal and regulatory restrictions on offers and sales of interests in private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction including the type of investors to whom such funds or private equity funds formed in other jurisdictions may be offered without registration under applicable securities laws in your jurisdiction except for publicly listed funds see question 29 for more details private equity funds are typically offered to a limited number of sophisticated largely institutional investors in the uk by way of private placement the term marketing is defined under the aifmd as a direct or indirect offering or placement at the initiative of the aifm or on behalf of the aifm of units or shares of an aif it manages to or with investors domiciled or with a registered office in the union marketing activities conducted by placement agents are considered to be carried out on behalf of an aifm and therefore are caught by the aifmd marketing rules and restrictions given that marketing has to be either at the initiative or on behalf of the aifm contact initiated by investors should not by definition be considered marketing and therefore should not be subject to the aifmd marketing restrictions the concept of reverse solicitation is recognised in the aifmd and by european regulators however there is no definition of or specific guidance on this concept at european level and the approaches taken by regulators at member states level differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the fca applies a narrow concept of marketing and has provided a helpful guidance specifying that a confirmation from the investor that the offering or placement was made at its initiative should normally be sufficient to demonstrate a reverse solicitation unless it is used to circumvent the application of the aifmd the definition of marketing under the aifmd also provides for investors being offered units in aifs this has given rise to the question of what activities are permissible before an aifm is deemed to be marketing within the scope of the aifmd it would be impractical for aifms to have to comply with the aifmd before they have been able to gauge whether there is any investor appetite for their fund in a particular eea member state the concept of pre marketing like reverse solicitation is a nebulous concept and each aifmd regulator takes a differing view in the uk for instance where the concept of marketing is narrow it is generally permissible for aifms to discuss an aif with investors and distribute pitch books draft fund documents such as a draft lpa and draft private placement memorandum until such fund documents are substantially final without being considered marketing and therefore triggering the application of the aifmd however most other eea member states have a broader concept of marketing and marketing starts as soon as any type of communication is circulated to potential investors that identifies the fund and its strategy the european commission has published legislative proposals for a regulation and a directive amending the current regulatory frameworks for cross border distribution of funds within the eea while the proposals are in principle designed to ensure a level playing field among different categories of funds and to facilitate the cross border distribution of funds they have the potential to create the opposite effect for non eea funds and fund managers by limiting the scope of permitted pre marketing the european commission intends to address the current diverse approach to what activities constitute pre marketing across member states by defining that term within the amended aifmd and by setting out a series of conditions under which an eea aifm can engage in pre marketing activities it is unfortunate however that the commission has chosen to pursue harmonisation in line with the most restrictive of the current national approaches and to introduce this as the mandatory benchmark across the eea by defining pre marketing as a direct or indirect provision of information on investment strategies or investment ideas by an aifm or on its behalf to professional investors domiciled or registered in the union in order to test their interest in the aif which is not yet established this would mean that non eea aifms would be considered marketing at a far earlier stage in the fundraising process and would be required to register under npprs having only had a limited opportunity to gauge interest from eea investors in addition to the foregoing an aifm will have to register for marketing purposes for an investor to whom it has pre marketed within the preceding 18 months and pre marketing activities need to be documented and the documents provided upon request to the competent authorities the proposals also contain further provisions to specify that investments made by professional investors in an established aif following the permitted pre marketing or an aif managed or marketed by the eea aifm that had engaged in pre marketing of a not yet established aif with similar features shall be considered the result of marketing while it was already market practice to consider that pre marketing a specific fund to investors precludes subsequent reliance on reverse solicitation with respect to that fund the proposal would also preclude any reverse solicitation with respect to any fund with the same or a similar strategy as the one that was the subject of the pre marketing this would appear to restrict the availability of reverse solicitation for any investors in prior funds which tends to be a key source of genuine reverse enquiry requests this proposed change has the potential to limit further the ability of non eea aifms to reach investors in closed jurisdictions with no viable nppr for which reverse solicitation is currently the only access route it should be noted that the financial promotion rules contained in the fsma and the financial services and markets act financial promotions order 2005 apply to fund marketing activities the financial promotions rules are wide in scope and cover communications in the course of business of an inducement or invitation to engage in investment activity the financial promotions rules are separate to the aifmd however an authorised or registered aifm will be considered as compliant with such rules where it markets an aif to professional investors in accordance with the aifmd any marketing to retail investors will need to comply with additional domestic restrictions these rules will therefore apply in situations where an aifm relies on reverse solicitation and may apply in the context of pre marketing situations under the aifmd types of investor describe any restrictions on the types of investors that may participate in private equity funds formed in your jurisdiction other than those imposed by applicable securities laws described above there are no uk restrictions on the types of investor that may participate in private equity funds although some investors may be restricted under the terms of their constitution or by capital or liquidity constraints see question 24 for information on marketing restrictions identity of investors does your jurisdiction require any ongoing filings with or notifications to regulators regarding the identity of investors in private equity funds including by virtue of transfers of fund interests or regarding the change in the composition of ownership management or control of the fund or the manager upon registration of an elp at companies house certain information including the full name of each of the general and limited partners and the amount contributed by each lp as capital to the partnership and the form of contribution if applicable must be filed with the registrar on form lp5 or form lp7 as applicable where any changes to this information occur form lp6 must be filed with the registrar there is also an obligation for elps to advertise in the gazette when an lp transfers its interest to another person or when a gp becomes an lp the change is only effective once the advertisement has been made pflps are not required to advertise in the gazette when an lp transfers its interest but are required to advertise a gp becoming an lp note however that the change is not conditioned on the advertisement having been made the lro disapplied section 36 of pa 1890 rights of persons dealing with firm against apparent members of firm with respect to pflps see question 9 for information on when there is a substantial change of control question 4 for tax related reporting requirements and question 2 for the information relating to investors which must be filed with companies house licences and registrations does your jurisdiction require that the person offering interests in a private equity fund have any licences or registrations as discussed in question 10 under the aifmd each aif has to have an aifm and uk aifms are required to be authorised and regulated by the fca marketing under the aifmd is an activity that is considered as being an aifm s function performed by or on behalf of the aifm and an eea aifm that is authorised under the aifmd to manage and market an aif and comply with all substantive requirements under the aifmd can then market the eea aif in other eea member states using the aifmd marketing passport non eea aifms cannot become fully aifmd authorised and benefit from the aifmd marketing passport and can only market under npprs and need to register individually with the regulator in each eea member state under article 42 aifmd before starting marketing in such eea member states in addition the marketing of interests in private equity funds in the uk as intermediary or placement agent may constitute a regulated activity such as arranging deals in investments this requires the person offering such interests to have the appropriate regulatory permissions from the fca fund managers should ensure that any placement agent engaged as part of a fundraising effort is appropriately regulated and has the correct regulatory permissions see question 24 for further detail on marketing money laundering describe any money laundering rules or other regulations applicable in your jurisdiction requiring due diligence record keeping or disclosure of the identities of or other related information about the investors in a private equity fund or the individual members of the sponsor the department of business energy and industrial strategy beis is responsible for transposing the section of the fourth money laundering directive mld4 which relate to increased transparency of corporate beneficial ownership information through inter alia the introduction of the psc regime although the obligation to maintain a psc register does not apply to elps slps are required to maintain a psc register and a uk corporate gp will similarly be required to maintain a psc register mld4 expanded the pre existing requirement on entities to carry out customer due diligence when establishing a business relationship carrying out occasional transactions amounting to 15 000 or more or the transfer of funds exceeding 1 000 mld4 introduced a stricter standard for customer due diligence than is currently in force as there will no longer be an automatic presumption that entities regulated for money laundering purposes and domiciled in the uk in member states of the eu or equivalent jurisdictions are deemed to be low risk and so subject to reduced customer due diligence measures firms are required to maintain adequate records of documents gathered in compliance with customer due diligence obligations for a period of five years following the end of the business relationship or the date of the occasional transaction if in the course of business a fund manager becomes aware or suspects that a customer is engaged in certain activities that are linked to money laundering it must report this to the uk national crime agency the fifth money laundering directive mld5 which aims among other reforms to clarify further certain elements of mld4 regarding approach to high risk countries for example to give enhanced mone tary powers to national authorities and to bring virtual currencies within the scope of the regime and is required to be implemented by all eu member states by 10 january 2020 the government observed a disproportionate growth in registration of slps in recent years with evidence that some of the increase may be due to slps being created for illicit purposes such as money laundering and terrorist financing as noted in question 2 the consultation proposed to require anyone presenting an application for registration or formation of a limited partnership to be supervised by an appropriate aml supervisory body and provide evidence of such supervision the response confirms this proposal and applications from overseas will be subject to equivalent standards and any list of overseas jurisdictions with equivalent standards will be subject to ongoing review the government has also indicated that it will undertake further work to explore whether to require beneficial ownership information from corporate partners that do not already hold a psc register exchange listing listing are private equity funds able to list on a securities exchange in your jurisdiction and if so is this customary what are the principal initial and ongoing requirements for listing what are the advantages and disadvantages of a listing private equity funds are able to list on certain uk securities exchanges for instance the london stock exchange s the lse main market and the lse s special funds market although listing private equity funds is not customary listing a fund provides a number of advantages to fund managers such as increased distribution potential as retail investors can invest in listed funds and access to permanent capital thus permitting fund managers to invest in long hold assets such as infrastructure without having to sell investments prematurely in order to realise proceeds before the end of the fund s life the main disadvantage to listing is the increased level of transparency required of listed funds and the increased regulatory burden fund managers have to file publicly available accounts and comply not just with funds related legislation but also legislation applying to listed companies please note that corporate entities tend to be used as listed private equity fund vehicles rather than elps restriction on transfers of interest to what extent can a listed fund restrict transfers of its interests transfer restrictions are typically included in the constitutional document governing the listed fund vehicle often alongside forced sale or redemption constructs or both primarily to address us securities law considerations as a general matter a listing on the lse including on the main market or in the specialist fund segment requires that the securities not be subject to unacceptable restrictions on transfer the uk listing authority has however historically permitted tailored restrictions including in the case of listed fund vehicles in their constitutional documents in order to permit issuers to avoid falling within onerous foreign legislative requirements participation in private equity transactions legal and regulatory restrictions are funds formed in your jurisdiction subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions that affect their participation in private equity transactions or otherwise affect the structuring of private equity transactions completed inside or outside your jurisdiction as noted in question 1 elps do not have separate legal personality and therefore cannot hold property in their own right or name consequently legal title to the elp s property tends to be vested in the name of the gp or a nominee company with beneficial title vesting in the elp uk based aifms are also subject to the asset stripping rules under the aifmd broadly speaking the asset stripping rules prohibit capital reductions certain distributions share buybacks and redemptions for the first 24 months following the acquisition of control of an eea portfolio company by an aif managed by the uk aifm in practice the rules can cause considerable difficulties and will for instance prohibit activities such as dividend recapitalisations taking place within the first 24 months of control of the relevant portfolio company attention should be paid to the structuring of investments in light of these rules compensation and profit sharing describe any legal or regulatory issues that would affect the structuring of the sponsor s compensation and profit sharing arrangements with respect to the fund and specifically anything that could affect the sponsor s ability to take management fees transaction fees and a carried interest or other form of profit share from the fund full scope aifms established in the uk have to comply with the fca s aifmd remuneration code in the fca handbook at sysc 19b and the european securities and markets authority s esma guidelines on sound remuneration policies under the aifmd which together impose extensive requirements and restrictions on remuneration policies and procedures governance structures and pay outs the aim of the rules and guidelines is to promote sound and effective risk management that does not encourage risk taking inconsistent with the risk profile of the aifm or the aifs it manages certain of the requirements apply firm wide while others apply only to staff with a material impact on the risk profile of the aifm or aifs for these purposes remuneration includes carried interest paid by the aif itself but the esma guidelines contain a safe harbour enabling certain of the more onerous requirements to be treated as met by an eu style whole fund carried interest model where carried interest paid is subject to clawback during the life of the aif and upon liquidation the aifmd requires aifms to comply with the remuneration requirements in a way that is proportionate to their size internal organisation and the nature scope and complexity of their activities and fca guidance interpreting this proportionality principle has enabled many uk based aifms to disapply the aifmd s most onerous pay out process rules aifms within banking groups may in addition need to apply the remuneration requirements of crd iv to aifm staff who have a material impact on the risk profile of the uk consolidation group or on the crd iv firm within that group where there is a conflict between the two sets of rules the aifmd rules take priority with the exception of the bonus cap which does not feature in the aifmd and which would nonetheless apply to the relevant staff member unless disapplication was permissible on grounds of proportionality or because of their level of pay and relative proportion of variable pay under a de minimis rule in december 2017 the european commission published proposals for a directive and regulation on a new prudential framework for investment firms the proposals aim to ensure that systemic and bank like investment firms are subject to key prudential requirements and corresponding supervisory arrangements that are adapted to their risk profile and business model the proposals do not specifically address the position of aifms but may have an impact for aifms that have additional asset management permissions or are part of banking and investment groups or both the proposals include remuneration and governance rules based on crd iv and mifid ii but unlike crd iv they do not currently include any requirement for a bonus cap for non systemic or smaller and interconnected entities however firms will still need to consider a prudent relationship between fixed and variable pay in their own remuneration policies if implemented the proposals will replace the existing prudential regime set out in crd iv the proposals are due to come into force in mid 2019 as the european commission is currently undertaking an extensive review of crd iv it remains to be seen how the prudential regime for investment firms including the bonus cap will be further affected mifid ii research and inducements requirements will apply to both full scope and most small authorised aifms aifms providing independent investment advice or portfolio management will be prohibited from receiving and retaining any fees commission or monetary or non monetary benefits from third parties under mifid ii such payments or benefits may be received by the aifm but they must be passed on in full to clients as soon as possible these requirements will not apply to any inducement considered to be a minor non monetary benefit the aifmd also requires the aifm to disclose as part of each fund s annual report the aggregate amount of remuneration paid by the aifm including the amount of carried interest and certain break downs the annual report must be made available to the investors and the fca upon request recent changes to the uk taxation of management fees carried interest performance related returns and the ability to use carried forward losses as discussed in question 21 should also be considered update and trends recent developments updates and trends as of the date of writing the uk will be leaving the eu on 29 march 2019 brexit the uk and eu are still in the process of negotiating the terms of the withdrawal and the future of the aifmd in the uk is dependent on the terms of such withdrawal or absence thereof the uk government has published draft regulations to transpose the aifmd into national law the aifm regulations so that the aifmd may continue to operate effectively after brexit assuming that brexit will entail the withdrawal of the uk from the single market uk aifms may not be able to market eea aifs to investors in the eea via the marketing passport or provide services in the uk to non uk eea aifs via the current passport regime in addition assuming cooperation arrangements are in place between the competent authorities of the uk and eea member states in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information that allows competent authorities of the uk to carry out their duties in accordance with the aifmd by the time brexit is effective uk aifms would have to comply with the npprs of eea member states in order to market to investors or to manage aifs in such member states however if such cooperation arrangements are not in place by then uk aifms will not be able to manage non uk eea aifs or market aifs to non uk eea investors under npprs with respect to eea aifms marketing eea aifs to investors in the uk the aifm regulations set out a temporary permissions regime to maintain the status quo in the three years following brexit as described more fully in the chapter the uk government is proposing to introduce further transparency and related filing requirements for uk limited partnerships it is yet to be seen how the government will actually implement such proposals and the effect this may have on the use of uk limited partnerships in private equity

ronald j tanski president and chief executive officer of national fuel gas company stated the company s second fiscal quarter results evidence the value of our integrated business model where the consistent earnings from each of our major operating segments contributed to our balanced consolidated earnings our financial results were in line with our forecast for the quarter and keep us on track to deliver results in line with our fiscal year earnings guidance which remains unchanged financial results in our regulated businesses were consistent with the prior year where higher earnings in the utility business offset a portion of the expected decline in the interstate pipeline business caused by the expiration of a large transportation contract in our exploration production business we experienced a few operational delays during the quarter which deferred a portion of our production that was scheduled to come online this quarter into the latter part of fiscal 2019 we still expect however that our steady three rig drilling program will deliver average production growth of 15 to 20 percent through our fiscal 2022 forecast period given our large undeveloped acreage position our production growth can be sustained throughout the next decade we are excited that that our various pipeline storage projects under development continue to take meaningful strides forward including the recent receipt of the ferc certificate for our empire north project positive legal and regulatory developments on our northern access project and the commencement of construction on our line n to monaca project each of these projects will help to meet the increasing regional demand for domestic and abundant natural gas supplies as the nation s electric grid continues to decrease reliance on aging coal fired plants and integrate more intermittent renewable generation facilities more reliance will be placed on natural gas electric generation much like many of our residential customers depend on their gas powered back up generators fiscal 2019 guidance national fuel is reaffirming its full year earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 the company projects that earnings on a non gaap basis will be within the range of 3 45 to 3 65 per share or 3 55 per share at the midpoint of the range the company s earnings guidance range reflects the impact of actual results for the six months ended march 31 2019 an update to the company s commodity price assumptions to reflect the current futures market including a 10 per barrel increase in nymex crude oil offset by the consolidated impact of the reduction in its production guidance discussed below further changes in nymex or appalachian basin spot natural gas prices are not expected to have a significant impact on current year earnings as the realizations on a large portion of the company s remaining natural gas production are locked in with firm sales and financial hedges projections for consolidated and individual segment capital expenditures are unchanged the company is revising its exploration and production segment s fiscal 2019 net production guidance to be in the range of 205 to 215 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe at the midpoint of the range the company s revised fiscal 2019 production guidance represents an 18 percent increase over fiscal 2018 the 10 bcfe or 5 percent decrease from the midpoint of the company s previous guidance range is primarily due to the following factors drilling and completion delays at dcnr tracts 007 and 100 in the eda which has deferred forecasted production online dates the impact of the company s ongoing testing efforts to optimize its utica drilling and completion design in the wda and the company s continued trend towards drilling longer laterals which is expected to benefit the program s economics but defers the online dates related to future development pads beyond the previous plan while the delays in new well turn on dates have the effect of pushing production to future periods they are not expected to have a material impact on the ultimate recovery of the company s reserves or the economics of its marcellus and utica programs the company s earnings guidance range does not include the impact of certain items that impacted the comparability of earnings during the six months ended march 31 2019 including 1 the remeasurement of deferred income taxes resulting from the 2017 tax reform act which reduced the company s income tax expense and benefited consolidated earnings in the six months ended march 31 2019 by 0 06 per share 2 the full year impact of the exploration and production segment s unrealized gain on hedging ineffectiveness and 3 the unrealized loss on other investments due to the change in an accounting rule discussed on page 6 which lowered earnings by 0 02 per share while the company expects to record additional adjustments to one or more of these items during the remaining six months ending september 30 2019 the amounts of these and other potential adjustments are not reasonably determinable at this time as such the company is unable to provide earnings guidance other than on a non gaap basis additional details on the company s forecast assumptions and business segment guidance for fiscal 2019 are outlined in the table on page 8 discussion of results by segment the following discussion of earnings of each operating segment for the quarter ended march 31 2019 is summarized in a tabular form on pages 9 and 10 of this report earnings drivers for the six months ended march 31 2019 are summarized on pages 11 and 12 it may be helpful to refer to those tables while reviewing this discussion note that management defines adjusted operating results as reported gaap earnings adjusted for items impacting comparability

was driven primarily by lower operating revenues and higher operation and maintenance o m expenses which were partially offset by lower income tax expense due to the impact of the 2017 tax reform act the 4 4 million decrease in operating revenues was due largely to the anticipated expiration of a significant firm transportation contract on the empire system in december 2018 the impact of the contract expiration was partially offset by an increase in empire s transportation rates following the company s rate case settlement effective january 1 2019 the settlement remains subject to ferc

to mature in may 2019 the 1 9 million increase in o m expense was substantially offset by the 2 3 million decrease in other deductions which was largely a result of non service pension and postretirement benefit costs that are now reported separately from o m expenses following the adoption of new accounting guidance in the current year the 2017 tax reform act lowered the company s statutory federal income tax rate from a blended 24 5 percent in fiscal 2018 to 21 percent in fiscal 2019 which decreased income tax expense on current period income by 1 5 million in accordance with state regulatory orders the utility segment has been recording a refund provision to return the net effect of the 2017 tax reform act to its customers the refund provision recorded during the quarter as a reduction to operating revenues was 3 7 million higher than the refund provision recorded in the prior year reducing second quarter earnings by 2 8 million and offsetting the benefit of the lower

energy marketing segment s second quarter gaap earnings were largely unchanged versus the prior year as the slight decline in customer margins operating revenues less purchased gas sold was offset by

operations had combined earnings of 2 2 million in the current year second quarter which was 5 3 million higher than the loss of 3 1 million in the prior year second quarter the increase in earnings was primarily attributable to the impact of the 2017 tax reform act which resulted in a remeasurement of deferred income taxes that increased the prior year s second quarter income tax expense by 2 7 million and the impact of 3 8 million in unrealized gains on investments in equity securities recorded during the quarter 3 0 million after tax unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities are now recognized in earnings following the adoption of new accounting guidance in the current year these unrealized gains and losses had been previously recorded as other comprehensive

since last friday honduras has been rocked by growing strikes and demonstrations by teachers health care workers high school and university students and their supporters against legislation that facilitates budget cuts mass firings and the privatization of public education and the healthcare system the government of juan orlando hernández known as joh a continuation of the regime installed by a us backed coup in 2009 mobilized riot police to repress protesters with tear gas rubber bullets and beatings dozens of demonstrators have been injured and at least 10 detained on monday when more than ten thousand workers and youth were marching in the capital tegucigalpa a plainclothes police officer identified as jairo alberto flores lópez was seen in videos speaking on a communication radio and shooting at demonstrators with a pistol while running next to riot police one of the bullets hit the chest of josé humberto duarte a 54 year old teacher barely missing his vital organs the constant deadly attacks by the armed forces of the us puppet regime in tegucigalpa against workers and youth struggling for their social and democratic rights exposes the farce of the human rights pretexts that us imperialism uses for its neo colonial wars invasions and regime change operations across the world most recently in its efforts to overthrow the maduro government in venezuela teachers and doctors across honduras struck on monday and tuesday and joined may day demonstrations on wednesday a holiday their chants included bring down the dictatorship and joh leave the protests in honduras are part of a growing upsurge of the class struggle across the continent and internationally in opposition to social austerity and attacks on jobs wages and benefits regionally they follow the longest strike in costa rican history last year also led by teachers and mass protests against pension cuts in nicaragua and student protests in march against water privatization in el salvador maría dilia paz a teacher demonstrating in tegucigalpa on monday described her conditions to telesur we do everything we can to make ends meet you know how the electrical service is and if you are late one day they cut you off our children at times go with little food they don t get snacks because we don t have any the 65 000 teachers in the country get paid hourly wages at poverty levels between 2 70 and 3 80 per hour of classes thousands joined marches and roadblocks in other major cities from the northern san pedro sula and la ceiba to comayagua and choluteca in the south on monday protesters blocked the border with nicaragua at guasaule and were violently removed by honduran police three government buildings including the city hall and a drug store were set on fire on monday in the capital reportedly by demonstrators and the headquarters of the ruling party was damaged on wednesday government officials and the corporate media have claimed that the structural reforms composed of vague language about allowing the ministries to revise the budget and yearly operating plan aim to save 300 million that will be re invested these reassurances however ring hollow for workers and youth who have witnessed years of cuts and deterioration in these vital public services as well as the outright stealing of funds by the ruling clique including hundreds of millions of dollars taken from the healthcare system to finance joh s 2016 presidential campaign the general workers central cgt which is aligned with the regime openly backed the measures while the trade union of public education employees and the honduran medical association have opposed them on the basis of getting a seat at the table in further talks on tuesday national party legislators announced that they would suspend the final ratification of the bills to continue the talks with the unions and opposition parties in response the trade unions and the doctors association called off further strikes workers recognize that any negotiation with this puppet regime of the us and honduran financial elites cannot result in the public services hondurans deserve as union and government officials claim reports on the bills have been accompanied prominently in the media by news of ongoing meetings between the government and the international monetary fund since april 8 taking place both in washington dc and tegucigalpa the media outlets have highlighted a rescue package involving the restructuring of the state electric company enee however the main goal of the talks with the imf has been to receive new credits to cover the growing public debt in exchange for deeper austerity measures and privatizations on tuesday the advisor of the honduran council for private businesses cohep arturo alvarado a former finance minister announced that a deal was close we got explanations that there will not be any tax increases he said what is coming relates to governance or how to improve the quality of expenditures particularly in education and health care all political parties and the trade unions represent the interests of capitalists whose profits depend on the ability of honduras to attract foreign investments as a cheap labor platform with low or nonexistent taxes and social security costs the think tank on external debt fosdeh has calculated that debt servicing will exceed 45 billion lempiras us 1 85 billion this year surpassing the 39 6 billion lempiras us 1 6 billion budget for health care social security and education combined this would mean a 33 percent increase in the disbursement to the international and local financial vultures since 2018 and would amount to nearly a third of the total government budget the finance secretariat moreover calculates that business tax exemptions particularly for maquiladoras at the 24 export processing zones epz in the country will amount to 37 billion lempiras 1 5 billion this year meanwhile the average salary for the 132 000 workers making clothes auto parts and other products at maquiladoras is 40 per week in other words in the most unequal country of the americas billions are transferred each year from the wealth created by the working class to the financial and corporate elites through debt payments and tax exemptions while more than 60 percent of the population lives in poverty the rural areas are also simmering with social opposition on april 2 farmers across the country were joined in protests by lenca indigenous groups from the western intibucá department who marched to tegucigalpa to demand debt pardons and oppose foreclosures surrounding the near bankruptcy of the state owned national bank for agricultural development banadesa hundreds carried out peaceful marches and set up roadblocks in more rural departments in the north colón south valle and east olancho of the country the sustained concentration of land the building of dams deforestation and severe drought have pushed thousands of the most impoverished peasant families to the brink of starvation and forced many to migrate north the trump administration however is ramping up its attacks against immigrants to cultivate its fascistic base including the militarization of the border the illegal erosion of asylum rights threats to end the temporary protected status for 57 000 hondurans and mass deportations hundreds of thousands seeking to escape the desperate and deadly conditions in the country and cities in honduras with its widespread gangs and brutal state repression are being sent back the latest demonstrations signal coming social upheavals involving the broadest sectors of workers and oppressed us imperialism and the honduran client elite have been preparing by strengthening the repressive apparatus and using electoral fraud and the military to keep their preferred political representatives in power this saw the killing of 32 demonstrators in protests against the electoral fraud in november 2017 since the 2009 coup according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri the honduran military budget has tripled to a proportion of the gdp not seen since 1990 this doesn t include hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid from the pentagon which uses its military bases in honduras as a launching platform for interventions across the region

first quarter 2019 sales of 261 9 million beat the prior year quarter by 10 organic sales growth was 8 4 without the impact of the dutch power acquisition which we completed in march industrial division first quarter 2019 sales of 158 4 million represented a nearly 20 increase over the prior year quarter all product groups contributed to this division s continued strong organic sales growth agricultural division for the first quarter of 2019 sales were 53 2 million down 9 3 from the prior year quarter high crop yields and us trade disputes continue to negatively affect crop prices farm income and demand for new equipment we estimate retail sales of rotary cutters the primary product in this division are down 5 to 10 industry wide compared to the prior year quarter recent adverse weather conditions have also reduced equipment usage negatively affecting agricultural part sales furthermore this division sales were affected by the installation of a paint system upgrade which shut down production in its largest manufacturing facility for several days in january european division first quarter 2019 sales were 50 3 million up 6 5 over the prior year quarter but down 1 2 without the effect of the dutch power acquisition excluding an unfavorable currency translation effect of 3 5 million this division s local currency organic sales growth was 6 3 above the prior year quarter first quarter 2019 gross margin of 63 3 million grew 5 over the prior year first quarter our first quarter gross margin was 24 2 of sales which compares to 25 3 of sales for the prior year quarter the compression of percentage gross margin was due to several factors first the carryover impact of material cost increases had yet to be fully offset by mitigating pricing actions by the end of the quarter we began to see this effect easing due to reduced steel costs and a lower mix of free price increased shipments percentage gross margins were also affected by an unfavorable mix of high margin aftermarket parts sales to total sales while parts sales grew 3 9 over prior year they totaled 18 4 of first quarter 2019 sales compared to 19 5 in the prior year quarter with the difference mainly due to higher growth of industrial division whole goods sales year over year first quarter 2019 operating income of 22 6 million was 5 8 percent higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to industrial division organic sales growth and partially offset by the factors constraining gross margins already discussed first quarter 2019 operating income was 8 6 of sales compared to 9 of sales for the prior year quarter net income for the first quarter was at a record 15 3 million or 1 30 per diluted share compared to prior year quarter net income of 14 6 million or 1 24 per diluted share record first quarter 2019 ebitda was 28 9 million which was up 7 7 over the prior year quarter trailing 12 month ebitda of 126 5 million was up 13 3 over the prior year trailing 12 month result net cash used by operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 32 4 million which compares to 28 1 million net cash used in the prior year quarter the year to year difference of 4 3 million was mostly due to the ebitda growth being more than offset by higher receivables and inventories while most of this working capital investment is driven higher by higher whole goods demand in the industrial division slowing agricultural equipment retail sales also had a negative impact this is because first quarter retail sale usually generates a replacement order and the related receivable from the dealer becomes immediately due and payable prior to its invoice term also impacting operating cash flow was continued growth and demand for vacuum trucks this resulted in a 7 5 million increase in our rental fleet investment compared to a 5 7 million increase in the prior year quarter investing cash flows were primarily the use of 50 5 million to fund the dutch power acquisition capital spending for the first quarter 2019 was 5 3 million compared to 7 6 million for the prior year quarter this difference is primarily due to the timing of projects as we expect capital spending for the year to be above prior year levels due to the dutch power acquisition and to a lesser extent high levels of investment and working capital rental fleet and capital assets debt net of cash increased 69 9 million over the prior year first quarter our order backlog remains at a very healthy level ending the first quarter at 258 million including the dutch power acquisition which is about 8 4 higher than the prior year first quarter without the acquisition backlog increased 2 6 year over year in summary our first quarter 2019 results were highlighted by record first quarter sales up 10 record first quarter net income up almost 5 record first quarter ebitda of nearly 29 million completion of the dutch power acquisition and a strong quarter end backlog of 258 million i d now like to turn the call back over to ron ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director okay thank you dan we re pleased to once again start off another fiscal year in a positive fashion with record sales and earnings as usual there were some pluses and minuses in the quarter and certainly our industrial division was one of the big pluses as they had another strong quarter with good sales in earnings growth and we believe they are poised due to their backlog and the market outlook to continue to move forward in 2019 at a very healthy pace on the other hand our ag division had a weaker start to the year and we were constrained by the continuing soft agricultural market conditions which was further limited in the first quarter by some adverse weather conditions and we were also a little disappointed by our margins which were a little weaker than they should have been there were several factors contributing to this including a little higher level of shipments particularly at the start of the year in january that were booked prior to price increases we had implemented late last year in response to input cost inflation in the second half of 2018 so we also have the cost and associated disruption in january due to a major system upgrade at our biggest agricultural plant both of these situations are now behind us and while the soft agricultural market and lower farm incomes are continuing to constrain sales we feel our margins should started to improve in the second half of the first quarter and should continue to improve as we move forward so despite some of the pressure in the first quarter we feel that the pace of input cost increases have actually softened somewhat compared to last year and in some areas such as steel have actually come down a little not only in ag but across all of our business areas our european operations actually did well particularly given the somewhat overall softer economic conditions in continental europe but due to currency changes in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the previous year what was increased sales before acquisitions in local currency ended up as a decrease when translated to us dollars as dan pointed out and while we cannot control exchange rates we actually feel the outlook for our european operations remains positive on a local basis and this will certainly be helped by the acquisition in march of dutch power company the dutch power is a very nice fit with our overall strategy they provide some very nice complementary products to add to our existing range and they re just a good well run company and good addition we re glad to have as part of alamo group we re also pleased and i know commented in the last couple of years about we re looking at a lot of acquisition opportunities but valuations have been a bit of a challenge we re pleased that this year already we re looking at we ve not completed one we re looking at others the pipeline remains very buoyant and i think valuations are a little bit more in actionable ranges for us so acquisition activity is not the only things that we re actively keeping busy we actually have a lot of initiatives we re pursuing right now this includes a higher level of capital spending aimed at improving our manufacturing technology and making us more efficient some of this we ve even discussed previously like the new plant we re building in wisconsin which will allow us to combine the three super products vacuum truck facilities in that area into one much more efficient plant and but there s a lot of other initiatives on technology they re not as big but they should individually provide very nice returns on the incremental investments we re making in that area we re also very pleased that our ongoing development efforts are resulting in a steady stream of new and innovative products that we can add to our range so very recent examples of that are our mcconnel robo cut motors in europe and our alamo industrial mantis power units that has recently been introduced to the markets here in north america so we continue to believe that product development will be a big driver of our ongoing organic growth we also have some other internal developments which i think will benefit our company moving forward that i think are worth commenting on the first is that i know in december we announced that we were going to implement a share repurchase program aimed at sort of limiting any creep in our stock and let s say we ve already begun to implement that program and that is under way and the second we just announced in this in yesterday s press release that there is going to be a change in our reporting that we will implement later this year for years we have been reporting partly according to product lines and partly by geography whereas this will change and we ll put all of our reporting along product lines which we will believe will make us a little more transparent as well as help us operate more efficiently internally because putting all product groups together so we ll change from going from three reporting divisions to two just the industrial and ag since our european division has always been a mix of the same two divisions so as you can see we have a lot going on at alamo group and while there are certainly some challenges along the way we feel the stability and strength of our markets in general and our ongoing improvement initiatives combined with some acquisitions and new product introductions will continue to lead us very positively throughout this current 2019 and as usual we thank you for your support in this journey and with that i would like to open the floor to any questions you might have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi guys good morning dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning joe ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst wanted to ask on the agriculture sector so i wondering you talked about how i think at least in the press release if not also in your commentary there related to weather and that being a factor in addition to obviously we ve heard from other companies that the sector overall is still weak here just wondering sort of especially with the weather comments how you re thinking about growth as we progress through the year relative to the 6 ex currency that we saw in the first quarter dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean it s really sort of hard to say i mean certainly i think weather may affected some spare parts sales a little because the farmers were a little slower getting into the fields but i mean i think once they get in there the activity will pick up but certainly farm incomes are down and we feel that i mean i say it s we re seeing that equipment purchases in total had been off i think weather i mean there is still some rain in the midwest and i mean but that s fairly localized i mean i think on a broad basis i think weather will get better like say the winter was a little later so it caused some delays i don t see it causing any major disruptions long term i mean like to the whole year just some delays but i think it s just the ag conditions themselves there is a little too much green in storage and so i mean they need to get crop prices up before i think we re going to see equipment sales start to rebound joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then on the margin side first off could you quantify how much costs were related to the system upgrade dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer like say i know exactly what the system upgrade cost but it was the disruptions in other areas that and i don t think we handled it as well as we should to be honest but i can t give you a number for that so i really ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director the actual system upgrade was only inaudible was a couple hundred thousand dollars but there was really more of the days we were not producing product that was the main cost joe it lasted a little more than a week and it just kind of shut us down for a little bit because you can t obviously run your lean process until you get ready so joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay so that as well as the adverse sort of price cost situation which i assume improves maybe even starting in the second quarter that must ve cost over 1 million dollars at least would you say dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer correct yes all that cost over 1 million yes ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and in terms of the price cost i guess overall but you certainly sort of highlighted it more at the ag segment that starts to improve in second quarter considering the price increases that you have put in place dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely i mean because the ag sector is one of the sectors where we sort of do out of season pre season sales for dealer stocking orders and so we had i mean some backlog at the end of the year that was prior to our latest price increases so we yes but most of that is behind us most of that backlog is now shipped that was at the lower margins and i think most of what we re shipping going forward is all at higher margins plus in the second and third quarters our aftermarket parts are a higher percentage of our agricultural sales while because those are the active quarters for farm activity that s when they re like say the first and fourth quarters is more is higher percent of equipment sales versus second thirds are the percent of part sales goes up ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director we know that some of our material costs are coming down because we had negotiated based upon orders placed back in the fourth quarter and so the lead with the lead times of those particular products we know that those are going to be coming as well joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great and then at the industrial segment very strong quarter on the top line part of that i assume was a little bit of that was due to the favorable comp and the fact that you did have some production disruptions in the first quarter last year with that strike at the one facility of yours could you sort of give us an idea if you can at all how much of that was related to sort of that comp and what is sort of normalized growth i mean 20 is not sort of normalized i assume you would agree any way of sort of defining what sort of a normal growth was ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director actually 0 5 ph percentage of that growth was normalized in this case just because the backlog went up i mean we actually had very good bookings in the quarter we were helped by some new product introductions but yes no actually it was the comp affect was actually fairly minimal joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director it only affected the gradall plant i mean real battle zone one more we had but and i mean some things like i know even last year we were saying like our snow group was off a little this year i mean i d like say the late winter and heavy snow throughout this year certainly maybe caused farmers to be late but it made our snow division actually have a pretty good year finished last year very strong and start this year very good so snow was up and that had nothing to do with sort of the great all strike last year so i mean actually like i said these comps were a little off than last year but this year like they were just solid performance across all products within the division dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer i think last year we said it was only about 5 million impact on the top line ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director from a sales standpoint yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer for the strike ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director just related to the strike joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right okay just lastly and i ll hop back in queue i m just curious regarding the new segment reporting is there any more color or how significant is this i guess in terms of productivity and cost improvements or what not could you speak to that or any more color regarding that how significant it is the kind of dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer i think in the short term there won t be a lot i think it ll make us more efficient internally as we re having like units same kind of products in europe and the us start working together better and make that a little bit more efficient and make the flow of information between the units go a little bit better i don t think this is a major change but this we actually truly are changing the way we operate the business internally i mean you re doing a reorganization and so we have to tell everybody that we re doing it and it s not a big deal but i think it s the right deal and just be a pretty small incremental effect but it ll help us be more efficient moving forward joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great thanks a lot appreciate it dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director thanks operator all right thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from deforest hinman with walthausen co deforest hinman walthausen co analyst hi thanks for taking the questions just little more thinking about backlog while materials have been moving around can you help us understand if the implied margin in the backlog is higher or lower versus what we ve been doing maybe over the last quarter or last couple of quarters dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think like i said we have most of the they had a little low margin product in ag in the backlog we actually still have a little low margin product in europe in our rivard unit in backlog which is probably going to take another couple quarters in fact that i mean we had some big bookings early last year we ve had cost increases that have impacted those and some of those orders are being fully shipped in the second and the third quarter of this year well i mean are going to being shipped for the last two quarters and the next two quarters so that s a little bit but i would say in general those our backlog is at higher margin than it was it revealed in the first quarter we definitely had like say it had some residual ag products so i think i mean in total our margin and our backlog will be better in the second and third quarters and combined with the fact that costs aren t going up quite as much steel prices are actually coming down and the fact that like say we did some price last year was an odd year usually we do one price increase a year we did actually two last year and already one this year so i think the margin and backlog were in better shape than we were say three four months ago deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s very helpful dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer and heavily focused on the ag because i mean the industrial stuff usually is more build to order and we don t not have big lump borders like we do in ag or like we did this one in europe in rivard so i mean that kind of stuff where we respond quicker on pricing on cost changes and the majority of the backlog is in the industrial division deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay very helpful on the inventories they were touched on in their press release it sounds like to some extent there s inventory build and the queue it s kind of across the board raw materials finished goods and dutch power project ph added some is going to add some inventory or did add inventory in the quarter can you help us understand how that moves over the course of the year or do we have any internal target that you re willing to share in terms of where we think that inventory needs to go either in terms of absolute dollar basis or inventory turn metric dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer certainly last year inaudible prices were going up but lead times were going up and so i mean i think we found ourselves ordering sort of in advance and so we end up with a little too much and i think we didn t plan our inventory as well so that s why and then when ag sales fell off a little this quarter i mean we actually had inventory in the backlog to meet demand that didn t fully develop so we ended up with a little more there i think we just didn t manage that as well as we should have but i mean we don t i mean to give out we have individual targets for units that we need to get back in line i mean just sort of gross numbers i think in the next quarter or two we need to reduce at least 20 million out of inventory on adjusted for whatever sales increase there are but just on today s basis that i say i expect to get at least 20 million out in the next quarter or two deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s helpful and then we ve closed the dutch power deal can you give us an update on the deal pipeline and maybe help us understand some of the multiples that you re seeing dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer the deal pipeline is actually staying pretty active we re seeing lots of stuff i mean half of what we re interested in i mean those doesn t really fit us in our strategy but even the things we re we d like i mean we re actually inaudible from our side is spending a lot more time on just analyzing and looking at the deals right now than we typically do and that s why i said i mean which comes down to a case by case basis but i think in general we re seeing that valuations have softened a little bit and so yes i mean they are we re not like these double digit multiples but i m seeing those the last several deals i have actually seen since the first of the year have been certainly below that and i think that bodes well for us come down to a case by case basis but at least we re getting more to look at and i think we ve done one and i think we re seeing other a couple of things that we re interested in that are probably actionable valuations are actionable that will allow us i mean our goals it s not as much what the multiple is and what we think within a couple of years we can have it that it needs to be we making the same kind of returns as our organic as our internal businesses are already so that s sort of where our target is and so we analyze each case of what we can do between synergies and growth opportunities what would can we get it to where it s making the same kind of returns that are the existing businesses already are within a reasonably short period of time because i mean since we re sort of mature products mature markets i mean this isn t some 10 year strategy if we can t get there in the next year or two i think you would be disappointed so that s how we try to evaluate things and come up with multiples but we re seeing more that are coming in that are available and sort of within the ranges that we think we can achieve that deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s very helpful color can you update us on what type of debt to ebitda leverage you re comfortable with at this time when it comes to doing a deal dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer we re fairly conservative certainly i mean all of our borrowing is sort of unsecured and very low covenant covenant light and usually 3 times 3 5 times leverage multiples we can maintain that i mean if you go above that i think you had a little more restrictions and all like this but even within that we can do 300 million or 400 million worth of that kind of with our ebitda and the ebitda what the acquisition target brings like i said 300 million or 400 million i d be glad i d love to find something at that range that we could buy and we probably even be willing to do more than that but if we did more than that we d probably want to do more of a combination of debt and equity rather than and all that just because again we re fairly conservative thinking and we want to have inaudible just because we do an acquisition that mean we re out of the acquisition market for a while we want to continue to be active in there so like i said even with conservative leverage 3 times 3 5 times that gives us more than enough capacity to do anything we re looking at right now deforest hinman walthausen co analyst thank you once again helpful color and then just update us on the outlook for share repurchases given the authorization indeed how you balance potential share repurchases with potential deals dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think the share repurchases are fairly like i said we re not trying to do a big share repurchase we re just trying to avoid the steady creep in our stock due to other things like stock options so we re not doing a lot and i don t see that being affected since the amount we re doing i mean the total amount we said we d buy was over a multi year period so in any one year we re not doing a lot and i don t see that going to be that would be affected by acquisitions or any other thing i mean if we still raise our dividend even with the stock repurchase i don t see that being affected by anything else we re doing like i said we re very conservatively financed conservative financial structure and like i said nothing we re going to that going to either way would inhibit us from doing that program deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay thank you that s all my questions dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director thank you deforest operator all right thank you operator instructions and our next question will come from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions i was wondering what the backlog looks like organically so excluding dutch power percentage wise dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think i said that 2 6 year over year ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes organically the backlog was up another 2 6 with dutch power it was up by 8 4 joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and where could you just walk us through maybe some of the strengths and weaknesses within the backlog because that does sort of project the slowing from i think it was up 10 at the end of the fourth quarter dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer you know the slowing parts industrial was up ag was down a little bit actually europe without dutch power was off little but i mean i know in europe we worked against some very strong comparables last year so i mean backlog is important but as we said in some ways we don t want it to get too big because if it gets too far out we like to keep our deliveries fairly reasonable so i would say yes i like a little more backlog now in ag industrial is at a more than healthy level and i think europe is at a reasonable level for being able to maintain good lead times so like i said i think and as i said last year s first quarter was a little bit off in the sales it was actually very strong in bookings so i think backlog to me is at a healthy level other than like i said a little bit more in ag joe mondillo sidoti company analyst great and backlog is only about a quarter s worth the revenue right so it s not you get a lot of bookings in the quarter and ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director and it s a little bit more than that because you remember our 20 of our sales are aftermarket parts and those don t really flow through the backlog number dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right okay good point okay all right and then at the european segment i was surprised to see certainly beat my expectations on the growth excluding currency i know you had some supplier constraint issues at the end of last year and some issues over there was part of the growth some timing that because of supplier constraints and any other issues that you were seeing over in that french operations or even in the uk too maybe was that things were just a timing issue and just pushed in the first quarter and then going forward not to expect that kind of growth going forward can you just talk about how why that was so strong dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer well no i mean the issues were worst in the third quarter and like i said i think we had solved most of those by the fourth quarter i like said in france we still got a little bit of low margin backlog in one of our units but yes i think i mean we ve been helped in europe by some new product introductions i mentioned the robo cut at our mcconnel unit in england and so i think uk group actually has done quite nicely i think there was a little bit of slowing i think in the overall european economy more on the continent i think uk we still got this brexit overhang and i think part of that actually the orders have been coming pretty smoothly even with brexit but they re not coming in advance i mean people are they are ordering kind of day to day stuff pretty regularly but they re not doing some of the big pre season order likes maybe they ve done in years past because they don t want to order and some of that s is going to be delivered next month they don t want to order some that s going to be delivered six months when they don t know what the tariff rate between england and france are going to be and this type of stuff so that s still a bit of an overhang and i m kind of disappointed they just keep kicking the can down the road i think i had this big deadline end of march and one in the middle of april and now it s one october but i m kind of losing track of these important deadlines but so all in all like i said i think our uk group is certainly doing better but our french group is actually like say is actually up a little too even though they got a little bit low margin backlog and i think we re really pleased the dutch power like i said we ve been kind of disappointed with the lack of acquisition activity in europe last couple of years but this is a good one that really fits nicely with us and i think we ll be able to do somewhat throughout some of the rest of our distribution so yes actually europe is holding up reasonably well for us and like say it would be a little bit more evident if it wasn t for currency joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right two more questions on the i was just wondering what your sort of outlook related to investing in the rental fleet and could you talk about sort of utilization rates and sort of demand that you re seeing overall there ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes i mean our demand and utilization rates are holding up at or above our expectations at our units like we got two new inaudible weakest are the two newest because we re still just building up the fleet there we added two branches there last year and due to constraints on production we actually had not fully staffed those from a product point of view and so like say we do have some internally pent up demand to get our equipment that all of our units especially the two newer ones so that continuing to drive that and utilization rates are holding up at or above our expectations and we ll probably open another branch as well this year as we continue which like say we ll consume product just setting up another branch too so that seems to be progressing at a healthy pace and joe we re also we expect to be higher than we are at the end of the q1 our expectations were at 49 million we want to grow more than that in the equipment and the rental fleet right joe mondillo sidoti company analyst all right well that actually does it for me dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thanks joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst thanks operator all right thank you and at this time there are no further questions in the queue so i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer

and payments on onerous contracts refer to the q1 2019 md a for further information on these amounts operating results our operating results for the first quarter of 2019 were buoyed by record production in the eagle ford and strong operating performance in canada in a much improved commodity price environment we successfully executed our first quarter drilling program and continued to drive cost and capital efficiency in our business we are now realizing the benefits of the baytex and raging river combination as we increase our operating netback deliver meaningful free cash flow

program which now represents 85 of our viking activity our capital program includes the seasonal slowdown in q2 2019 and we remain on track to drill approximately 250 net wells this year heavy oil our heavy oil assets at peace river and lloydminster produced a combined 29 341 boe d during the first quarter as compared to 28 290 boe d in q4 2018 as commodity prices and operating netbacks improved during the first quarter we reinitiated field activity including the completion of three previously deferred wells at peace river in addition we continued the ramp up of our kerrobert thermal expansion project achieving a peak production rate of 2 500 bbl d we have also expanded our acreage position at peace river acquiring an additional 26 sections of prospective land we expect to drill our first exploratory multilateral well on these lands in 2019 with wcs differentials returning to historical levels the returns associated with continued development of our heavy oil assets are now

amounts in this press release are stated in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified non gaap financial and capital management measures adjusted funds flow is not a measurement based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry we define adjusted funds flow as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in non cash operating working capital and asset retirement obligations settled our determination of adjusted funds flow may not be comparable to other issuers we consider adjusted funds flow a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of operating performance and our ability to generate funds for exploration and development expenditures debt repayment settlement of our abandonment obligations and potential future dividends in addition we use a ratio of net debt to adjusted funds flow to manage our capital structure we eliminate settlements of abandonment obligations from cash flow from operations as the amounts can be discretionary and may vary from period to period depending on our capital programs and the maturity of our operating areas the settlement of abandonment obligations are managed with our capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow changes in non cash working capital are eliminated in the determination of adjusted funds flow as the timing of collection payment and incurrence is variable and by excluding them from the calculation we are able to provide a more meaningful measure of our cash flow on a continuing basis for a reconciliation of adjusted funds flow to cash flow from operating activities see management s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended

development expenditures to measure and evaluate the performance of our capital programs the total amount of exploration and development expenditures is managed as part of our budgeting process and can vary from period to period depending on the availability of adjusted funds flow and other sources of liquidity net debt is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define net debt to be the sum of trade and other accounts receivable trade and other accounts payable and the principal amount of both the long term notes and the bank loan we believe that this measure assists in providing a more complete understanding of our cash liabilities and provides a key measure to assess our liquidity we use the principal amounts of the bank loan and long term notes outstanding in the calculation of net debt as these amounts represent our ultimate repayment obligation at maturity the carrying amount of debt issue costs associated with the bank loan and long term notes is excluded on the basis that these amounts have already been paid by baytex at inception of the contract and do not represent an additional source of liquidity or repayment obligation operating netback is not a measurement based on gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry operating netback is equal to petroleum and natural gas sales less blending expense royalties production and operating expense and transportation expense divided by barrels of oil equivalent sales volume for the applicable period our determination of operating netback may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities we believe that this measure assists in characterizing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production basis and is a key measure used to evaluate our operating performance advisory regarding oil and gas information where applicable oil equivalent amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead references herein to average 30 day initial production rates and other short term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating aggregate production for us or the assets for which such rates are provided a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out in respect of all wells accordingly we caution that the test

what does us 100 per barrel crude oil mean for the world s economy it depends how long the price holds and who you are surging crude prices are posing another headwind for the world economy after us president donald trump s zero pledge on iran oil sales brent crude has risen about 40 per cent this year and is at the highest in six months while higher prices due to strong demand typically reflects a robust world economy a shock from constrained supply is a negative much will depend on how sustained the spike proves to be exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand ultimately there comes a point where higher prices may be damaging to everyone 1 what does it mean for global growth the impact will vary rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation as the world s biggest importer of oil china is vulnerable and many countries in europe also rely on imported energy seasonal effects will also impact with the northern hemisphere summer approaching consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage a slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices 2 how can the world economy absorb oil at 100 for a sustained hit to growth economists say oil would need to hold above us 100 it also depends on dollar strength or weakness given crude is priced in greenbacks analysis by oxford economics found that brent at us 100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0 6 per cent lower than currently projected by end 2020 with inflation on average 0 7 percentage points higher we see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices oxford economists john payne and gabriel sterne wrote in a note in the short run it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach us 100 3 how will iran and trump impact the market an upending of global oil trade around the iran trump spat could continue to have a sizeable impact on financial markets as the affected supply is as much as 800 000 barrels a day uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets and the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility trump has pledged to help alongside saudi arabia and the uae those needing to shift orders from iran to another supplier but the us claims that its domestic supply can help offset the loss are a high bar to meet given that the daily american output for similar crude is about a quarter of iran s 4 who wins from higher oil prices emerging economies dominate the list of oil producing nations which is why they re affected more than developed ones the increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account deficits allowing governments to increase spending that will spur investment winners include saudi arabia russia norway nigeria and ecuador according to analysis by nomura 5 who loses those emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies which in turn would spark inflation that in turn will force governments and central banks to weigh up their options hike interest rates even as growth slows or ride it out and risk capital flight nomura s losers list includes turkey ukraine and india 6 what does it mean for the world s biggest economy while us oil producers try to take advantage of any sales boost from customers moving away from iran the broader us economy will not necessarily see benefits with oil price tags as high as us 100 a barrel it would be a squeeze on american consumers that are the backbone of still steady economic growth prices at the gas pump already have risen 6 3 per cent this month to us 2 87 a gallon which could weigh on retail sales that jumped in march by the most since 2017 and if things go awry in global oil markets there s risk that political blame shifts back to the us for the sanctions which could mean backlash via investment or other channels that threatens economic stability 7 will it lead to higher inflation around the world because energy features prominently in consumer price gauges policymakers look to core indexes that remove volatile components if the run up in prices proves to be substantial and sustained those costs will filter through to transport and utilities 8 what does it mean for central banks led by the us federal reserve central banks around the world have taken a dovish tilt as the absence of inflation allows policymakers to shift their focus to slowing growth that s unlikely to quickly change the international monetary fund imf this month lowered its global growth forecast and said the world is in a delicate moment source bloomberg

ronald j tanski president and chief executive officer of national fuel gas company stated the company s second fiscal quarter results evidence the value of our integrated business model where the consistent earnings from each of our major operating segments contributed to our balanced consolidated earnings our financial results were in line with our forecast for the quarter and keep us on track to deliver results in line with our fiscal year earnings guidance which remains unchanged financial results in our regulated businesses were consistent with the prior year where higher earnings in the utility business offset a portion of the expected decline in the interstate pipeline business caused by the expiration of a large transportation contract in our exploration production business we experienced a few operational delays during the quarter which deferred a portion of our production that was scheduled to come online this quarter into the latter part of fiscal 2019 we still expect however that our steady three rig drilling program will deliver average production growth of 15 to 20 percent through our fiscal 2022 forecast period given our large undeveloped acreage position our production growth can be sustained throughout the next decade we are excited that that our various pipeline storage projects under development continue to take meaningful strides forward including the recent receipt of the ferc certificate for our empire north project positive legal and regulatory developments on our northern access project and the commencement of construction on our line n to monaca project each of these projects will help to meet the increasing regional demand for domestic and abundant natural gas supplies as the nation s electric grid continues to decrease reliance on aging coal fired plants and integrate more intermittent renewable generation facilities more reliance will be placed on natural gas electric generation much like many of our residential customers depend on their gas powered back up generators fiscal 2019 guidance national fuel is reaffirming its full year earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 the company projects that earnings on a non gaap basis will be within the range of 3 45 to 3 65 per share or 3 55 per share at the midpoint of the range the company s earnings guidance range reflects the impact of actual results for the six months ended march 31 2019 an update to the company s commodity price assumptions to reflect the current futures market including a 10 per barrel increase in nymex crude oil offset by the consolidated impact of the reduction in its production guidance discussed below further changes in nymex or appalachian basin spot natural gas prices are not expected to have a significant impact on current year earnings as the realizations on a large portion of the company s remaining natural gas production are locked in with firm sales and financial hedges projections for consolidated and individual segment capital expenditures are unchanged the company is revising its exploration and production segment s fiscal 2019 net production guidance to be in the range of 205 to 215 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe at the midpoint of the range the company s revised fiscal 2019 production guidance represents an 18 percent increase over fiscal 2018 the 10 bcfe or 5 percent decrease from the midpoint of the company s previous guidance range is primarily due to the following factors drilling and completion delays at dcnr tracts 007 and 100 in the eda which has deferred forecasted production online dates the impact of the company s ongoing testing efforts to optimize its utica drilling and completion design in the wda and the company s continued trend towards drilling longer laterals which is expected to benefit the program s economics but defers the online dates related to future development pads beyond the previous plan while the delays in new well turn on dates have the effect of pushing production to future periods they are not expected to have a material impact on the ultimate recovery of the company s reserves or the economics of its marcellus and utica programs the company s earnings guidance range does not include the impact of certain items that impacted the comparability of earnings during the six months ended march 31 2019 including 1 the remeasurement of deferred income taxes resulting from the 2017 tax reform act which reduced the company s income tax expense and benefited consolidated earnings in the six months ended march 31 2019 by 0 06 per share 2 the full year impact of the exploration and production segment s unrealized gain on hedging ineffectiveness and 3 the unrealized loss on other investments due to the change in an accounting rule discussed on page 6 which lowered earnings by 0 02 per share while the company expects to record additional adjustments to one or more of these items during the remaining six months ending september 30 2019 the amounts of these and other potential adjustments are not reasonably determinable at this time as such the company is unable to provide earnings guidance other than on a non gaap basis additional details on the company s forecast assumptions and business segment guidance for fiscal 2019 are outlined in the table on page 8 discussion of results by segment the following discussion of earnings of each operating segment for the quarter ended march 31 2019 is summarized in a tabular form on pages 9 and 10 of this report earnings drivers for the six months ended march 31 2019 are summarized on pages 11 and 12

increase of 2 7 bcfe or 6 percent from the prior year natural gas production increased 3 3 billion cubic feet bcf or 8 percent due primarily to production from new marcellus and utica wells completed

the impact of hedging and transportation costs was 2 58 per thousand cubic feet mcf an increase of 0 06 per mcf from the prior year the improvement was driven primarily by higher nymex pricing and local spot pricing in pennsylvania which benefited realizations on seneca s unhedged production seneca s oil production for the second quarter decreased 99 thousand barrels mbbl due largely to the impact of the sale of seneca s sespe properties in california in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 seneca s average realized oil price after the impact of hedging was 61 01 per barrel bbl an increase of 2 70 per bbl over the prior year the improvement in oil price realizations was due primarily to stronger price differentials relative to west texas intermediate wti index prices at local sales points in california loe expense increased 2 1 million due mostly to higher gathering expenses in appalachia resulting from the increase in natural gas production coupled with an increase in well repairs contract labor and steam fuel costs in the west coast region partially offset by lower operating costs in california following the sale of seneca s sespe properties dd a expense increased 3 9 million due to the increase in production and a higher unit depletion rate the 2017 tax reform act lowered the company s statutory federal income tax rate from a blended 24 5 percent in fiscal 2018 to 21 percent in fiscal 2019 which decreased the segment s income tax expense on current period income by 1 0 million the impact of the lower federal rate on current quarter income was more than offset

was driven primarily by lower operating revenues and higher operation and maintenance o m expenses which were partially offset by lower income tax expense due to the impact of the 2017 tax reform act the 4 4 million decrease in operating revenues was due largely to the anticipated expiration of a significant firm transportation contract on the empire system in december 2018 the impact of the contract expiration was partially offset by an increase in empire s transportation rates following the company s rate case settlement effective january 1 2019 the settlement remains subject to ferc approval o m expense increased 3 1 million due primarily to an increase in compressor and facility maintenance activity during the quarter and higher personnel costs the 2017 tax reform act lowered

adjustments contributed to the increase in customer margins interest expense decreased 0 6 million due primarily to the company s early refinancing of an 8 75 percent coupon 10 year note that was set

statutory federal income tax rate from a blended 24 5 percent in fiscal 2018 to 21 percent in fiscal 2019 which decreased income tax expense on current period income by 1 5 million in accordance with

operations had combined earnings of 2 2 million in the current year second quarter which was 5 3 million higher than the loss of 3 1 million in the prior year second quarter the increase in earnings

stop feeding the chinese empire â belt and roadâ trojan horse whoever has an army has power mao zedong in march italy broke ranks with its eu partners in joining china s belt and road initiative known also as one belt one road or the new silk road students of history know the original silk road refers to the ancient network of trading routes between china and europe which served as both a conduit for the movement of goods and an exchange of ideas for centuries the new silk road is the term for an ambitious trade corridor first proposed by the chinese regime under its current president xi jinping in 2013 the grand design also known confusingly as the belt and road initiative bri is a belt of overland corridors and a road of shipping lanes it consists of a vast network of railways pipelines highways and ports that would extend west through the mountainous former soviet republics and south to pakistan india and southeast asia so far over 60 countries containing two thirds of the world s population have either signed onto bri or say they intend to do so according to the center for foreign relations the chinese government has already spent about 200 billion on the growing list of mega projects projects including the 68 billion china pakistan economic corridor morgan stanley predicts china s expenditures on bri could climb as high as 1 3 trillion by 2027 the belt and road initiative is seen by proponents as an economic driver of proportions never seen before in human history it would not only allow asia to relieve its infrastructure bottleneck ie an 800 billion annual shortfall on infrastructure spending but bring less developed neighboring nations into the modern world by providing a growing market of 1 38 billion chinese consumers opponents argue that is naive and the real intent of bri is to carve new chinese spheres of influence in asia that will replace the united states in debt poor nations to china for decades and restore china to its former imperial glory this article leans heavily towards the latter interpretation of bri particularly its linkages between china s industrial and military build up it explains why belt and road is really a dangerous trojan horse hiding behind china s territorial ambitions that should be resisted especially by vulnerable countries that are risking long term debt servitude the new silk road the silk routes connected china india tibet the persian empire the mediterranean countries and parts of north and east africa the 7 000 mile silk road begins at the chinese city of x an formerly chang an when it reaches dunhuang the silk road splits into three routes the southern route central route and and northern route these trade routes spread throughout the xinjiang uygur autonomous region and extended as far as pakistan india and even rome the silk road routes were established during the han dynasty which opened trade to the west in 130 bc and they lasted until 1453 ad when the ottoman empire boycotted trade with china and closed them the han extended the great wall of china to protect the movement of chinese goods along the silk road the maritime silk road was a network of shipping lines from the red sea to east africa india china and southeast asia the network consisted of ship routes in two general directions the east china sea routes and the south china sea routes the east china sea routes connected the chinese mainland to the northeast asian regions of the liaodong peninsula the korean peninsula and the japanese islands the south china sea route heads down then up through the malacca straits into the bay of bengal opening up china to the coasts of the indian ocean the red sea the persian gulf and the african continent these shipping lanes are still in use as mentioned the belt part of the belt and road initiative introduced by president xi jinping in 2013 refers to a network of overland road and rail routes and oil natural gas pipelines planned to run along the major eurasian land bridges china mongolia russia china central and west asia china indochina peninsula china pakistan bangladesh china india myanmar they ll stretch from xi an in central china through central asia reaching as far as moscow rotterdam and venice the road is a network of ports and other coastal infrastructure projects from south and southeast asia to east africa and the northern mediterranean sea china is already the world s largest consumer of commodities why does it need to build a belt and road there are a few reasons the first as mentioned is to construct physical infrastructure such as railways roads and bridges that will help the region to meet its 800 billion annual infrastructure shortfall estimated by the asian development bank china would also build 50 special economic zones modeled after the shenzhen special economic zone first launched in 1980 under economic reformer president deng xiaoping less benevolently bri would allow china to expand the use of the chinese currency the yuan something we have written about as the global influence of the us dollar as the world s reserve currency wanes according to the centre for foreign relations bri is also a central tenet of xi jinping s pushback against obama s pivot to asia contain china by extending us ties to southeast asia and distancing himself from his predecessors who followed deng s philosophy bide your strength bide your time for xi the waiting is over the time for imperialist expansion is now political aspirations an asia geopolitical expert says that while the new silk road satisfies a number of economic goals for china including expanding its supply chains accessing overseas labor and preventing massive layoffs when companies run out of domestic infrastructure to build the over riding goal is regional influence richard javad heydarian author of asia s new battlefield the usa china and the struggle for the western pacific writes above all however it allows china to lock in precious mineral resources and transform nations across the eurasian land mass and indian ocean into long term debtors a leading credit rating agency recently warned that the obor is driven primarily by china s efforts to extend its global influence where genuine infrastructure needs and commercial logic might be secondary to political motivations the result is what one observer aptly described as debt trap diplomacy since some nations end up piling up unsustainable debts to china meanwhile larger nations such as india have raised concerns over china s geopolitical intensions since the project runs through the disputed kashmir region other countries from indonesia to the philippines and nigeria have raised concerns over the quality of chinese infrastructure investments their compliance with good governance and environmental regulations and beijing s tendency to employ not only chinese technology and engineers but also chinese labourers for overseas projects debt trap so far we have learned the 5ws of the belt and road initiative it s easy to see how the trillion dollar infrastructure network benefits china but what about the 60 odd nations who have said they want in what s in it for them the huge projects need to be paid for somehow china s idea is for chinese state owned firms to build the infrastructure paid for by participating countries those who can t afford it and that is most of them would be offered inexpensive loans and credit it s no different from banks offering rock bottom interest rates to homeowners whose incomes are below that needed to support a mortgage chinese state owned banks and china led international financial institutions like the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib would shoulder the debt burden china has set up an initial 40 billion silk road fund while the aiib is allocating an additional 50 billion but the loans come with huge risks in 2017 when sri lanka couldn t pay off its chinese creditors beijing took control of colombo a strategic port through a 99 year lease by the end of 2018 nearly a quarter of sri lanka s foreign debt was owed to china the money accepted for around 8 billion worth of ports and highways planned through bri some countries have scaled back or canceled bri projects due to the specter of unsustainable debt burdens states al jazeera hopefully italy is aware of the risks the southern european country is heavily in debt and went into recession last year it reportedly wants to re balance sino italian trade by exporting more to china it is the 13th eu member country that has signed an mou with china regarding bri but the first g7 nation to do so sparking condemnation from the united states which is engaged in a trade war with china and the eu which earlier this year branded china a systemic rival and wants to restrict chinese investment in europe al jazeera said military buildup is it a coincidence that the chinese president xi jingping is racing around trying to sign countries onto bri while at the same time posing for photos in full military uniform saluting chinese soldiers we don t think so tuesday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s liberation army pla and the chinese navy did not squander the opportunity to show its latest show of power a stealth destroyer according to a reuters story the combat ready 10 000 ton nanchang 101 is armed with 113 vertical launch sales able to fire hhq 0 surface to air missiles yj 18 anti cruise missiles and cj 10 land attack cruise missiles we have written extensively on the escalating tensions between the us and china in the south china sea where china holds historical claims despite international treaties to the contrary ie the un convention on the law of the sea china has been dredging seabed and building islands on which it has constructed outposts including missile batteries despite claims of ownership by vietnam malaysia philippines taiwan and brunei ongoing maneuvers demonstrate that beijing is willing to flex its muscles in a region it sees as strategically and economically important china is increasing its military drills around japan with japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times within a year against chinese aircraft according to japan s annual military white paper there are also frequent tensions in the taiwan strait the body of water separating china and taiwan a us ally the united states supplies weapons to taiwan despite not having diplomatic relations with the island and its government china sees taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be re united with the chinese mainland its independence is not recognized by beijing a forced reunification between china and taiwan would almost certainly cause a war between china and the us meanwhile china continues to expand its military a year ago it was reported that china planned to boost military spending by 8 1 in 2018 compared to a 7 increase in 2017 a reuters in depth report on how china is displacing america as the world s predominant military power in asia is required reading for anyone interested in how the geopolitical balance of power in the north pacific is shifting it details how xi jinping is overhauling the pla which includes the navy by pouring more resources into the navy and ridding the pla s ranks of corruption in just over two decades china has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the u s armory china s shipyards have spawned the world s biggest navy which now rules the waves in east asia beijing can now launch nuclear armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines giving it a powerful second strike capability and the pla is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the south china sea while stepping up preparations to recover taiwan by force if necessary for the first time since portuguese traders reached the chinese coast five centuries ago china has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast conflict between china and the united states in these waters would be destructive and bloody particularly a clash over taiwan according to serving and retired senior american officers and despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the cold war there would be no guarantee america would prevail the u s could lose said gary roughead co chair of a bipartisan review of the trump administration s defense strategy published in november we really are at a significant inflection point in history industry military connection we know that china is planning a huge infrastructure buildout in its trillion dollar bri involving some 60 odd countries and we know that beijing is at the same time bulking up its military what we don t know is if the two are related is china covertly funneling money from bri into its military in december 2018 the new york times reported on a secret proposal to expand a program by the pakistani air force by building chinese military jets weaponry and other hardware there would also be increased cooperation between china and pakistan in space where rocket propelled technology often overlaps with the military according to the article the military projects were designated as part of china s belt and road initiative in response to that claim cnbc quoted michael fuchs a senior fellow at the center for american progress and a former u s deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs from 2013 to 2016 that doesn t necessarily mean the chinese military will use the entire bri to its advantage but it will certainly tap into a number of projects he added bri infrastructure schemes in member countries such as pakistan sri lanka and djibouti are all about giving access to china s military he said a 2018 report by c4ads a us based research group sought to tease out whether china s portrayal of bri as strictly economic is true as explained by south china morning post the report looked at 15 chinese funded port projects in bangladesh sri lanka cambodia australia oman malaysia indonesia djibouti and elsewhere in the indo pacific region it found that the projects were not win win for china and the host countries as china claimed rather the investments appear to generate political influence stealthily expand china s military presence and create an advantageous strategic environment in the region the report stated resource raids of course none of this should come as a shock if we look at how china has repeatedly sought raw materials necessary to feed its resource ravenous economy we ve covered how china is locking up critical resources in the us s own backyard we also know that bri whatever china s motivations is going to require a hell of a lot more mined commodities it doesn t have an abundance of like copper zinc iron ore etc mining com reported in under 10 years the number of china headquartered mining companies with assets in africa went from just a handful in 2006 to 120 in 2015 two high profile examples are the acquisition by china general nuclear power corporation of the husab uranium project in namibia and zijin mining s involvement 39 6 in the massive kamoa kakula copper deposit in the drc while iron ore and copper have been the hot targets of overseas acquisitions by chinese firms the chinese have also gone after gold nickel tin and coking coal more recently the most desired metals are those that feed into the tectonic global shift from fossil fuels to the electrification of vehicles china molybdenum bought the tenke copper and cobalt mine in the democratic republic of congo for 2 65 billion in an effort to secure a supply of cobalt for ev batteries last summer china s ganfeng lithium paid chilean state lithium miner 87 5 million for sqm s 50 stake in the cauchari olaroz lithium project in argentina the purchase means china now effectively controls half of the world s lithium production necessary for lithium ion batteries conclusion china s ascent from an economic backwater to a 21st century superpower is nothing short of incredible within 30 years the country whose citizenry was oppressed impoverished and riding around on bicycles is now the world s biggest consumer of mined commodities influences real estate markets worldwide just look at vancouver and has obscenely rich people driving 100 000 luxury cars except for its horrible air quality china is now the envy of many poorer countries but that doesn t mean they should roll over and let china take advantage of its weaker brethren the belt and road initiative is not some modern day asian version of the marshall plan the united states had obvious economic motivations in giving 12 billion to help rebuild western europe but there was also the strategic imperative of helping europe to get back on its feet in order to contain a rising ussr no such threat exists with bri china has no reason to come to its neighbors aid with multi billion dollar infrastructure loans other than to gain economic and political influence over them sure there may be some programs where it s a win win but it appears the deck is way stacked against bri host nations where the outcome will almost certainly leave china the clear winner as uncle ben in spider man said with great power comes great responsibility that assumes that the one wielding the power

prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers all in sustaining costs the company

in sustaining costs and total cash costs do not have any standardized meaning whether under ifrs or otherwise and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers accordingly other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in underlying principles and policies applied differences may also arise to a different definition of sustaining versus non sustaining

bangkok originally published by inter press service the world bank has successfully promoted its maximizing finance for development mfd strategy by embracing the united nations sustainable development goals internationally endorsed in september 2015 it has also secured support from the g20 of twenty biggest economies and effectively pre empted alternative approaches at the third un financing for development summit in addis ababa in mid 2015 as the main show in town developing countries will need to address the mfd s implications by responding pro actively and collectively to address the new challenges it poses managing new macro financial challenges as the mfd agenda privileges foreign investors and portfolio inflows multilateral development banks mdbs should be obliged to clearly show how developing countries will benefit greater vulnerability and other adverse implications of being more closely integrated into fickle global financial markets which detract from the ostensible advantages of such integration are now widely acknowledged the imf and other international financial institutions ifis should also advise on the efficacy of various policy instruments such as macroprudential measures including capital controls to ensure central bank control of domestic credit conditions although portfolio flows are generally recognized as pro cyclical ifis reluctantly recommend capital controls and even then only after governments have exhausted all other monetary and fiscal policy options after experiencing repeated boom bust cycles in capital flows many emerging markets have learnt that they must manage such flows if they are to reap some benefits of financial globalization while trying to minimize risks addressing systemic risks in fact many concerned economists believe that monetary and fiscal policies cannot adequately address such systemic fragilities but may inadvertently exacerbate them e g raising interest rates may attract more capital inflows instead of just stemming outflows after effectively eschewing capital controls for decades despite its article vi provisions recent imf advice has been inherently contractionary by raising interest rates and tightening fiscal policy instead of judiciously using smart capital controls development oriented governments must include those familiar with changing securities and derivatives markets who will have to work with central banks on regulating cross border flows and managing systemic vulnerabilities it is difficult for development oriented governments to be pragmatic and agile when they are subject to the dictates of private finance especially when these appear to be rules based anonymous and foreign financial systems are increasingly being reorganized around securities markets dominated by transnational institutional investors who have transformed financial incentives and banking business models many banks have reorganized themselves around securities and derivative markets where short term profit opportunities are significantly higher than traditional alternatives requiring costly nurturing of long term information intensive relations stopping capital outflows from developing countries international financial liberalization has enabled further capital outflows from most developing countries depriving them of much needed resources to develop their economies the economic fiction that open capital accounts would result in needed net financial flows from capital rich developed economies in the north to capital poor developing countries in the south has been disproved thus a significant share of the money flowing into global shadow banking institutional investors asset managers comes from developing countries such capital outflows are typically due to tax arbitrage and avoidance practices by transnational corporations and wealthy individuals there is also considerable capital flight by those who have accumulated wealth by corrupt and other dubious means the illicit sources of such riches encourage storing such wealth abroad effective cooperation to check and return such ill gotten gains often syphoned out using illicit means such as trade mispricing and other forms of money laundering can go a long way equitable international tax cooperation would increase financial resources available all round especially to developing country governments instead the imf and others should enable developing country authorities to effectively implement policies to more successfully mobilize domestic financial resources for investment in developing economies ensuring transparent government guarantees and subsidies the mfd approach seeks to commit fiscal resources to de risking securities and other financial instruments to attract foreign institutional investments it is thus re orienting governments to effectively guarantee profits for private investors from financing development projects effectively reducing public financial resources available for development projects to minimize abuses and to protect the public interest mdbs should instead ensure the transparency and accountability of the framework by making clear the likely fiscal and other including opportunity costs of de risking projects public interest agencies civil society organizations and the media should help governments closely monitor such costs and make the public fully aware of the costs and risks involved

chief financial officer thank you ron record first quarter 2019 sales of 261 9 million beat the prior year quarter by 10 organic sales growth was 8 4 without the impact of the dutch power acquisition which we completed in march industrial division first quarter 2019 sales of 158 4 million represented a nearly 20 increase over the prior year quarter all product groups contributed to this division s continued strong organic sales growth agricultural division for the first quarter of 2019 sales were 53 2 million down 9 3 from the prior year quarter high crop yields and us trade disputes continue to negatively affect crop prices farm income and demand for new equipment we estimate retail sales of rotary cutters the primary product in this division are down 5 to 10 industry wide compared to the prior year quarter recent adverse weather conditions have also reduced equipment usage negatively affecting agricultural part sales furthermore this division sales were affected by the installation of a paint system upgrade which shut down production in its largest manufacturing facility for several days in january european division first quarter 2019 sales were 50 3 million up 6 5 over the prior year quarter but down 1 2 without the effect of the dutch power acquisition excluding an unfavorable currency translation effect of 3 5 million this division s local currency organic sales growth was 6 3 above the prior year quarter first quarter 2019 gross margin of 63 3 million grew 5 over the prior year first quarter our first quarter gross margin was 24 2 of sales which compares to 25 3 of sales for the prior year quarter the compression of percentage gross margin was due to several factors first the carryover impact of material cost increases had yet to be fully offset by mitigating pricing actions by the end of the quarter we began to see this effect easing due to reduced steel costs and a lower mix of free price increased shipments percentage gross margins were also affected by an unfavorable mix of high margin aftermarket parts sales to total sales while parts sales grew 3 9 over prior year they totaled 18 4 of first quarter 2019 sales compared to 19 5 in the prior year quarter with the difference mainly due to higher growth of industrial division whole goods sales year over year first quarter 2019 operating income of 22 6 million was 5 8 percent higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to industrial division organic sales growth and partially offset by the factors constraining gross margins already discussed first quarter 2019 operating income was 8 6 of sales compared to 9 of sales for the prior year quarter net income for the first quarter was at a record 15 3 million or 1 30 per diluted share compared to prior year quarter net income of 14 6 million or 1 24 per diluted share record first quarter 2019 ebitda was 28 9 million which was up 7 7 over the prior year quarter trailing 12 month ebitda of 126 5 million was up 13 3 over the prior year trailing 12 month result net cash used by operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 32 4 million which compares to 28 1 million net cash used in the prior year quarter the year to year difference of 4 3 million was mostly due to the ebitda growth being more than offset by higher receivables and inventories while most of this working capital investment is driven higher by higher whole goods demand in the industrial division slowing agricultural equipment retail sales also had a negative impact this is because first quarter retail sale usually generates a replacement order and the related receivable from the dealer becomes immediately due and payable prior to its invoice term also impacting operating cash flow was continued growth and demand for vacuum trucks this resulted in a 7 5 million increase in our rental fleet investment compared to a 5 7 million increase in the prior year quarter investing cash flows were primarily the use of 50 5 million to fund the dutch power acquisition capital spending for the first quarter 2019 was 5 3 million compared to 7 6 million for the prior year quarter this difference is primarily due to the timing of projects as we expect capital spending for the year to be above prior year levels due to the dutch power acquisition and to a lesser extent high levels of investment and working capital rental fleet and capital assets debt net of cash increased 69 9 million over the prior year first quarter our order backlog remains at a very healthy level ending the first quarter at 258 million including the dutch power acquisition which is about 8 4 higher than the prior year first quarter without the acquisition backlog increased 2 6 year over year in summary our first quarter 2019 results were highlighted by record first quarter sales up 10 record first quarter net income up almost 5 record first quarter ebitda of nearly 29 million completion of the dutch power acquisition and a strong quarter end backlog of 258 million i d now like to turn the call back over to ron ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director okay thank you dan we re pleased to once again start off another fiscal year in a positive fashion with record sales and earnings as usual there were some pluses and minuses in the quarter and certainly our industrial division was one of the big pluses as they had another strong quarter with good sales in earnings growth and we believe they are poised due to their backlog and the market outlook to continue to move forward in 2019 at a very healthy pace on the other hand our ag division had a weaker start to the year and we were constrained by the continuing soft agricultural market conditions which was further limited in the first quarter by some adverse weather conditions and we were also a little disappointed by our margins which were a little weaker than they should have been there were several factors contributing to this including a little higher level of shipments particularly at the start of the year in january that were booked prior to price increases we had implemented late last year in response to input cost inflation in the second half of 2018 so we also have the cost and associated disruption in january due to a major system upgrade at our biggest agricultural plant both of these situations are now behind us and while the soft agricultural market and lower farm incomes are continuing to constrain sales we feel our margins should started to improve in the second half of the first quarter and should continue to improve as we move forward so despite some of the pressure in the first quarter we feel that the pace of input cost increases have actually softened somewhat compared to last year and in some areas such as steel have actually come down a little not only in ag but across all of our business areas our european operations actually did well particularly given the somewhat overall softer economic conditions in continental europe but due to currency changes in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the previous year what was increased sales before acquisitions in local currency ended up as a decrease when translated to us dollars as dan pointed out and while we cannot control exchange rates we actually feel the outlook for our european operations remains positive on a local basis and this will certainly be helped by the acquisition in march of dutch power company the dutch power is a very nice fit with our overall strategy they provide some very nice complementary products to add to our existing range and they re just a good well run company and good addition we re glad to have as part of alamo group we re also pleased and i know commented in the last couple of years about we re looking at a lot of acquisition opportunities but valuations have been a bit of a challenge we re pleased that this year already we re looking at we ve not completed one we re looking at others the pipeline remains very buoyant and i think valuations are a little bit more in actionable ranges for us so acquisition activity is not the only things that we re actively keeping busy we actually have a lot of initiatives we re pursuing right now this includes a higher level of capital spending aimed at improving our manufacturing technology and making us more efficient some of this we ve even discussed previously like the new plant we re building in wisconsin which will allow us to combine the three super products vacuum truck facilities in that area into one much more efficient plant and but there s a lot of other initiatives on technology they re not as big but they should individually provide very nice returns on the incremental investments we re making in that area we re also very pleased that our ongoing development efforts are resulting in a steady stream of new and innovative products that we can add to our range so very recent examples of that are our mcconnel robo cut motors in europe and our alamo industrial mantis power units that has recently been introduced to the markets here in north america so we continue to believe that product development will be a big driver of our ongoing organic growth we also have some other internal developments which i think will benefit our company moving forward that i think are worth commenting on the first is that i know in december we announced that we were going to implement a share repurchase program aimed at sort of limiting any creep in our stock and let s say we ve already begun to implement that program and that is under way and the second we just announced in this in yesterday s press release that there is going to be a change in our reporting that we will implement later this year for years we have been reporting partly according to product lines and partly by geography whereas this will change and we ll put all of our reporting along product lines which we will believe will make us a little more transparent as well as help us operate more efficiently internally because putting all product groups together so we ll change from going from three reporting divisions to two just the industrial and ag since our european division has always been a mix of the same two divisions so as you can see we have a lot going on at alamo group and while there are certainly some challenges along the way we feel the stability and strength of our markets in general and our ongoing improvement initiatives combined with some acquisitions and new product introductions will continue to lead us very positively throughout this current 2019 and as usual we thank you for your support in this journey and with that i would like to open the floor to any questions you might have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi guys good morning dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning joe ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst wanted to ask on the agriculture sector so i wondering you talked about how i think at least in the press release if not also in your commentary there related to weather and that being a factor in addition to obviously we ve heard from other companies that the sector overall is still weak here just wondering sort of especially with the weather comments how you re thinking about growth as we progress through the year relative to the 6 ex currency that we saw in the first quarter dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean it s really sort of hard to say i mean certainly i think weather may affected some spare parts sales a little because the farmers were a little slower getting into the fields but i mean i think once they get in there the activity will pick up but certainly farm incomes are down and we feel that i mean i say it s we re seeing that equipment purchases in total had been off i think weather i mean there is still some rain in the midwest and i mean but that s fairly localized i mean i think on a broad basis i think weather will get better like say the winter was a little later so it caused some delays i don t see it causing any major disruptions long term i mean like to the whole year just some delays but i think it s just the ag conditions themselves there is a little too much green in storage and so i mean they need to get crop prices up before i think we re going to see equipment sales start to rebound joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then on the margin side first off could you quantify how much costs were related to the system upgrade dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer like say i know exactly what the system upgrade cost but it was the disruptions in other areas that and i don t think we handled it as well as we should to be honest but i can t give you a number for that so i really ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director the actual system upgrade was only inaudible was a couple hundred thousand dollars but there was really more of the days we were not producing product that was the main cost joe it lasted a little more than a week and it just kind of shut us down for a little bit because you can t obviously run your lean process until you get ready so joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay so that as well as the adverse sort of price cost situation which i assume improves maybe even starting in the second quarter that must ve cost over 1 million dollars at least would you say dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer correct yes all that cost over 1 million yes ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and in terms of the price cost i guess overall but you certainly sort of highlighted it more at the ag segment that starts to improve in second quarter considering the price increases that you have put in place dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely i mean because the ag sector is one of the sectors where we sort of do out of season pre season sales for dealer stocking orders and so we had i mean some backlog at the end of the year that was prior to our latest price increases so we yes but most of that is behind us most of that backlog is now shipped that was at the lower margins and i think most of what we re shipping going forward is all at higher margins plus in the second and third quarters our aftermarket parts are a higher percentage of our agricultural sales while because those are the active quarters for farm activity that s when they re like say the first and fourth quarters is more is higher percent of equipment sales versus second thirds are the percent of part sales goes up ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director we know that some of our material costs are coming down because we had negotiated based upon orders placed back in the fourth quarter and so the lead with the lead times of those particular products we know that those are going to be coming as well joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great and then at the industrial segment very strong quarter on the top line part of that i assume was a little bit of that was due to the favorable comp and the fact that you did have some production disruptions in the first quarter last year with that strike at the one facility of yours could you sort of give us an idea if you can at all how much of that was related to sort of that comp and what is sort of normalized growth i mean 20 is not sort of normalized i assume you would agree any way of sort of defining what sort of a normal growth was ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director actually 0 5 ph percentage of that growth was normalized in this case just because the backlog went up i mean we actually had very good bookings in the quarter we were helped by some new product introductions but yes no actually it was the comp affect was actually fairly minimal joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director it only affected the gradall plant i mean real battle zone one more we had but and i mean some things like i know even last year we were saying like our snow group was off a little this year i mean i d like say the late winter and heavy snow throughout this year certainly maybe caused farmers to be late but it made our snow division actually have a pretty good year finished last year very strong and start this year very good so snow was up and that had nothing to do with sort of the great all strike last year so i mean actually like i said these comps were a little off than last year but this year like they were just solid performance across all products within the division dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer i think last year we said it was only about 5 million impact on the top line ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director from a sales standpoint yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer for the strike ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director just related to the strike joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right okay just lastly and i ll hop back in queue i m just curious regarding the new segment reporting is there any more color or how significant is this i guess in terms of productivity and cost improvements or what not could you speak to that or any more color regarding that how significant it is the kind of dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer i think in the short term there won t be a lot i think it ll make us more efficient internally as we re having like units same kind of products in europe and the us start working together better and make that a little bit more efficient and make the flow of information between the units go a little bit better i don t think this is a major change but this we actually truly are changing the way we operate the business internally i mean you re doing a reorganization and so we have to tell everybody that we re doing it and it s not a big deal but i think it s the right deal and just be a pretty small incremental effect but it ll help us be more efficient moving forward joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great thanks a lot appreciate it dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director thanks operator all right thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from deforest hinman with walthausen co deforest hinman walthausen co analyst hi thanks for taking the questions just little more thinking about backlog while materials have been moving around can you help us understand if the implied margin in the backlog is higher or lower versus what we ve been doing maybe over the last quarter or last couple of quarters dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think like i said we have most of the they had a little low margin product in ag in the backlog we actually still have a little low margin product in europe in our rivard unit in backlog which is probably going to take another couple quarters in fact that i mean we had some big bookings early last year we ve had cost increases that have impacted those and some of those orders are being fully shipped in the second and the third quarter of this year well i mean are going to being shipped for the last two quarters and the next two quarters so that s a little bit but i would say in general those our backlog is at higher margin than it was it revealed in the first quarter we definitely had like say it had some residual ag products so i think i mean in total our margin and our backlog will be better in the second and third quarters and combined with the fact that costs aren t going up quite as much steel prices are actually coming down and the fact that like say we did some price last year was an odd year usually we do one price increase a year we did actually two last year and already one this year so i think the margin and backlog were in better shape than we were say three four months ago deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s very helpful dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer and heavily focused on the ag because i mean the industrial stuff usually is more build to order and we don t not have big lump borders like we do in ag or like we did this one in europe in rivard so i mean that kind of stuff where we respond quicker on pricing on cost changes and the majority of the backlog is in the industrial division deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay very helpful on the inventories they were touched on in their press release it sounds like to some extent there s inventory build and the queue it s kind of across the board raw materials finished goods and dutch power project ph added some is going to add some inventory or did add inventory in the quarter can you help us understand how that moves over the course of the year or do we have any internal target that you re willing to share in terms of where we think that inventory needs to go either in terms of absolute dollar basis or inventory turn metric dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer certainly last year inaudible prices were going up but lead times were going up and so i mean i think we found ourselves ordering sort of in advance and so we end up with a little too much and i think we didn t plan our inventory as well so that s why and then when ag sales fell off a little this quarter i mean we actually had inventory in the backlog to meet demand that didn t fully develop so we ended up with a little more there i think we just didn t manage that as well as we should have but i mean we don t i mean to give out we have individual targets for units that we need to get back in line i mean just sort of gross numbers i think in the next quarter or two we need to reduce at least 20 million out of inventory on adjusted for whatever sales increase there are but just on today s basis that i say i expect to get at least 20 million out in the next quarter or two deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s helpful and then we ve closed the dutch power deal can you give us an update on the deal pipeline and maybe help us understand some of the multiples that you re seeing dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer the deal pipeline is actually staying pretty active we re seeing lots of stuff i mean half of what we re interested in i mean those doesn t really fit us in our strategy but even the things we re we d like i mean we re actually inaudible from our side is spending a lot more time on just analyzing and looking at the deals right now than we typically do and that s why i said i mean which comes down to a case by case basis but i think in general we re seeing that valuations have softened a little bit and so yes i mean they are we re not like these double digit multiples but i m seeing those the last several deals i have actually seen since the first of the year have been certainly below that and i think that bodes well for us come down to a case by case basis but at least we re getting more to look at and i think we ve done one and i think we re seeing other a couple of things that we re interested in that are probably actionable valuations are actionable that will allow us i mean our goals it s not as much what the multiple is and what we think within a couple of years we can have it that it needs to be we making the same kind of returns as our organic as our internal businesses are already so that s sort of where our target is and so we analyze each case of what we can do between synergies and growth opportunities what would can we get it to where it s making the same kind of returns that are the existing businesses already are within a reasonably short period of time because i mean since we re sort of mature products mature markets i mean this isn t some 10 year strategy if we can t get there in the next year or two i think you would be disappointed so that s how we try to evaluate things and come up with multiples but we re seeing more that are coming in that are available and sort of within the ranges that we think we can achieve that deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay that s very helpful color can you update us on what type of debt to ebitda leverage you re comfortable with at this time when it comes to doing a deal dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer we re fairly conservative certainly i mean all of our borrowing is sort of unsecured and very low covenant covenant light and usually 3 times 3 5 times leverage multiples we can maintain that i mean if you go above that i think you had a little more restrictions and all like this but even within that we can do 300 million or 400 million worth of that kind of with our ebitda and the ebitda what the acquisition target brings like i said 300 million or 400 million i d be glad i d love to find something at that range that we could buy and we probably even be willing to do more than that but if we did more than that we d probably want to do more of a combination of debt and equity rather than and all that just because again we re fairly conservative thinking and we want to have inaudible just because we do an acquisition that mean we re out of the acquisition market for a while we want to continue to be active in there so like i said even with conservative leverage 3 times 3 5 times that gives us more than enough capacity to do anything we re looking at right now deforest hinman walthausen co analyst thank you once again helpful color and then just update us on the outlook for share repurchases given the authorization indeed how you balance potential share repurchases with potential deals dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think the share repurchases are fairly like i said we re not trying to do a big share repurchase we re just trying to avoid the steady creep in our stock due to other things like stock options so we re not doing a lot and i don t see that being affected since the amount we re doing i mean the total amount we said we d buy was over a multi year period so in any one year we re not doing a lot and i don t see that going to be that would be affected by acquisitions or any other thing i mean if we still raise our dividend even with the stock repurchase i don t see that being affected by anything else we re doing like i said we re very conservatively financed conservative financial structure and like i said nothing we re going to that going to either way would inhibit us from doing that program deforest hinman walthausen co analyst okay thank you that s all my questions dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director thank you deforest operator all right thank you operator instructions and our next question will come from joe mondillo with sidoti company joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions i was wondering what the backlog looks like organically so excluding dutch power percentage wise dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think i said that 2 6 year over year ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes organically the backlog was up another 2 6 with dutch power it was up by 8 4 joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and where could you just walk us through maybe some of the strengths and weaknesses within the backlog because that does sort of project the slowing from i think it was up 10 at the end of the fourth quarter dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer you know the slowing parts industrial was up ag was down a little bit actually europe without dutch power was off little but i mean i know in europe we worked against some very strong comparables last year so i mean backlog is important but as we said in some ways we don t want it to get too big because if it gets too far out we like to keep our deliveries fairly reasonable so i would say yes i like a little more backlog now in ag industrial is at a more than healthy level and i think europe is at a reasonable level for being able to maintain good lead times so like i said i think and as i said last year s first quarter was a little bit off in the sales it was actually very strong in bookings so i think backlog to me is at a healthy level other than like i said a little bit more in ag joe mondillo sidoti company analyst great and backlog is only about a quarter s worth the revenue right so it s not you get a lot of bookings in the quarter and ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director and it s a little bit more than that because you remember our 20 of our sales are aftermarket parts and those don t really flow through the backlog number dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right okay good point okay all right and then at the european segment i was surprised to see certainly beat my expectations on the growth excluding currency i know you had some supplier constraint issues at the end of last year and some issues over there was part of the growth some timing that because of supplier constraints and any other issues that you were seeing over in that french operations or even in the uk too maybe was that things were just a timing issue and just pushed in the first quarter and then going forward not to expect that kind of growth going forward can you just talk about how why that was so strong dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer well no i mean the issues were worst in the third quarter and like i said i think we had solved most of those by the fourth quarter i like said in france we still got a little bit of low margin backlog in one of our units but yes i think i mean we ve been helped in europe by some new product introductions i mentioned the robo cut at our mcconnel unit in england and so i think uk group actually has done quite nicely i think there was a little bit of slowing i think in the overall european economy more on the continent i think uk we still got this brexit overhang and i think part of that actually the orders have been coming pretty smoothly even with brexit but they re not coming in advance i mean people are they are ordering kind of day to day stuff pretty regularly but they re not doing some of the big pre season order likes maybe they ve done in years past because they don t want to order and some of that s is going to be delivered next month they don t want to order some that s going to be delivered six months when they don t know what the tariff rate between england and france are going to be and this type of stuff so that s still a bit of an overhang and i m kind of disappointed they just keep kicking the can down the road i think i had this big deadline end of march and one in the middle of april and now it s one october but i m kind of losing track of these important deadlines but so all in all like i said i think our uk group is certainly doing better but our french group is actually like say is actually up a little too even though they got a little bit low margin backlog and i think we re really pleased the dutch power like i said we ve been kind of disappointed with the lack of acquisition activity in europe last couple of years but this is a good one that really fits nicely with us and i think we ll be able to do somewhat throughout some of the rest of our distribution so yes actually europe is holding up reasonably well for us and like say it would be a little bit more evident if it wasn t for currency joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right two more questions on the i was just wondering what your sort of outlook related to investing in the rental fleet and could you talk about sort of utilization rates and sort of demand that you re seeing overall there ronald a robinson chief executive officer and president and director yes i mean our demand and utilization rates are holding up at or above our expectations at our units like we got two new inaudible weakest are the two newest because we re still just building up the fleet there we added two branches there last year and due to constraints on production we actually had not fully staffed those from a product point of view and so like say we do have some internally pent up demand to get our equipment that all of our units especially the two newer ones so that continuing to drive that and utilization rates are holding up at or above our expectations and we ll probably open another branch as well this year as we continue which like say we ll consume product just setting up another branch too so that seems to be progressing at a healthy pace and joe we re also we expect to be higher than we are at the end of the q1 our expectations were at 49 million we want to grow more than that in the equipment and the rental fleet right joe mondillo sidoti company analyst all right well that actually does it for me dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thanks joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst thanks operator all right thank you and at this time there are no further questions in the queue so i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks dan e malone executive vice president and chief financial officer all right well again thank you all very much for joining us today glad to be off to a decent start for 2019 as always a few challenges but i think we feel good about the outlook for the company and again thank you for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter conference call in august have a good day thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes

adjusted ebitda and adjusted gross margin including on a per mt basis are not defined under ifrs see non ifrs measures below 4 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation q1 2019 activities despite significant macro headwinds in the wcsb source increased its revenue by 5 when compared to q1 of 2018 volume and revenue growth were driven by contracted customers increasing their completion program efficiencies requiring the delivery of greater volumes of completion materials over shorter periods of time we experienced pricing pressure early in the quarter in the spot market driven by competitors aggressive pricing to lock up q1 programs however as the quarter progressed and the weather deteriorated we witnessed short periods of stronger 2019 pricing during the first quarter we substantially completed our growth capital program for the year with the expansion of the fox creek terminal in addition we completed the permitting for initial phase of crude by rail at our wembley terminal sahara activity levels increased year over year in the wcsb and we have expanded an existing contract to include an additional sahara unit for the balance of the term we have deployed two units to the north east us and we have completed our 8th unit which will be deployed to the wcsb or the lower 48 in the second quarter business outlook our customers activity levels in the first quarter of 2019 increased significantly from the fourth quarter of 2018 source is expecting its 2019 sales volumes to be substantially in line with 2018 despite the expectation of lower capital spending throughout the wcsb the growth in direct source exploration and production e p contracts year over year is expected to lead to increased market share which should help maintain source s sales volumes customer capital programs and demand for frac sand could be impacted by several factors including timing of spring break up in the wcsb commodity price fluctuations and condensate demand in the wcsb as e p companies continue to shift into manufacturing mode the trend towards direct sourcing continues and source is pleased to be working directly with five e p customers under these types of contractual arrangements these contracted sales are in addition to sales to other e p companies that wish to direct source sand on a non contract basis as well as traditional sales to pressure pumping customers beyond 2019 we are excited by the industry prospects with anticipated improved pipeline and other transportation capacity and the longer term impacts of increased demand for liquefied natural gas lng on wcsb activity levels in addition source deployed a second sahara unit to the marcellus these units represent an important step for source as we diversify our revenue streams into additional basins in north america first quarter conference call a conference call to discuss source s first quarter financial results has been scheduled for 7 30 am

aging middle class americans worry about retirement and for good reason the financial and economic crises of the last several years have left the country 10 percent poorer obliterating 6 1 trillion in wealth some of which people were saving for retirement when the tv talking heads aren t reminding us about plummeting house prices they re speculating about not whether but by how much politicians will cut social security and medicare benefits the baby boom generation must wonder if it s about to go bust the problems aren t limited to the boomers themselves as america ages social security medicare and medicaid expenditures will inexorably rise leaving less money for infrastructure defense and other important things there s also the risk that tens of millions of boomers discovering that they haven t saved enough money for their dotage might all sell their assets at the same time and severely pare back their spending plunging the economy not just into recession but into long term stagnation americans in their late forties through their early sixties shouldn t stock up on cat food quite yet though nor should we accept as inevitable a future in which the elderly consume so many public resources that they suppress growth for decades mass retirement will transform america yes and for some people the transformation may be unpleasant but it need not drag the nation under the art archive at first glance the situation does look bleak more retirees less money this year the oldest of the 78 million babies born between 1946 and 1964 are turning 65 and becoming senior citizens because of the immense size of this baby boom generation the number of senior citizens will more than double between now and 2050 from 40 million to 89 million and because the nation s overall population will grow more slowly older folks will make up an ever larger share of it increasing from 13 percent now to 20 percent in 2050 thanks to botox and treadmills the boomers are aging well their finances not so much as some federal reserve numbers show baby boomers like most americans have seen no wage gains for two decades in 2007 families headed by younger boomers those aged 45 through 54 earned a median income of 64 200 almost exactly the same in inflation adjusted dollars as families in the same age group earned in 1989 the comparison doesn t work well for the older boomers those aged 55 through 64 because as we ll see people are retiring later these days which skews their incomes for years boomers made up for their stagnant wages by borrowing helping expand the credit bubble two decades ago the average american family headed by someone in his late forties or early fifties owed 38 100 in 2007 dollars by the time the global debt mania peaked in 2007 such families had more than doubled their indebtedness to an average of 95 900 all numbers in this story are adjusted for inflation and this particular figure doesn t include the 13 percent of such families that had no debt at all a number that has remained fairly stable for 20 years older boomers too dramatically increased their debt relative to earlier generations from 15 400 in 1989 to 60 300 in 2007 and the percentage that didn t owe money fell from 29 percent to 18 percent everyone knows the chief culprit behind the debt explosion mortgages in 2007 the typical younger boomer family with a mortgage 66 percent of the group was 110 000 in house secured debt that was nearly triple the amount that a similar family owed two decades earlier 41 900 the average older boomer family with a mortgage meanwhile owed 85 000 in 2007 well over twice the 32 200 that the equivalent family owed in 1989 more older boomers too had mortgage debt 55 percent compared with 37 percent in 1989 another sign that the boomers weren t paying down their mortgages enough in preparation for retirement was that in 1989 45 to 54 year olds owed a full 35 percent less in mortgage debt than people a decade younger did by 2007 the figure had fallen to 14 percent until the real estate bubble burst middle aged americans told themselves that they were nurturing nest eggs investments that would more than enable them to pay back what they owed the facts seemed to bear them out over the two decades leading up to 2007 the values of homes owned by people aged 45 to 54 exploded rising 68 percent after inflation to an average of 230 000 older boomers made similar gains boomers also diligently socked away money in retirement accounts by 2007 the two thirds of younger boomers who had such accounts held 63 000 in them on average older boomers held 100 000 thanks to the rising value of real estate and of stocks younger boomers had managed on the eve of the financial crisis to amass an average net worth assets minus debt of 184 900 a modest but very real gain of 16 percent relative to their counterparts 20 years ago older boomers had 254 100 a striking 61 percent better than the previous generation by 2009 though all of the younger boomers gains were gone when their stock and house values crashed but their massive debt remained younger boomers average wealth contracted to 145 400 9 percent below what folks had two decades ago older boomers fared better but still lost 15 percent with their wealth shrinking to 214 800 at first glance that decline seems catastrophic that 145 400 even if it grew 5 percent a year for another 20 years until retirement would generate only the future equivalent of 15 400 in 2011 dollars in annual retirement income as for older boomers because they have much less time for their assets to grow their current 214 800 would generate only about 14 000 a year in retirement income true older boomers are likelier to have corporate pensions to supplement their assets but for most americans those sums would offer a bare subsistence not a fulfilled existence especially if politicians slashed social security too as conventional wisdom has long regarded as inevitable it s no surprise then that folks feel queasy about their retirement prospects the employee benefit research institute ebri conducts an annual survey sponsored largely by financial groups to quantify this unease the 2011 edition found that americans confidence in their ability to afford a comfortable retirement has plunged to a new low half of workers of all ages were not at all confident or not too confident that they could save enough before they stopped working up from 29 percent in 2007 before the financial crisis of people aged 45 through 54 29 percent lacked any confidence in their retirement prospects more than double the 11 percent similarly worried in 2007 part of the solution to the retirement crisis is to shorten the years of retirement working longer is the key to a secure retirement for the vast majority of older americans notes alicia munnell a boston college management prof and director of the school s retirement research center if you re working you re not consuming your savings as much in the best case you re still adding to them the idea of working until the end or closer to it isn t new many of today s retirees have enjoyed decades of relaxation financed by company pensions and social security but for most of history voluntary retirement was the exception not the rule up to the end of the nineteenth century people generally worked as long as they could munnell writes at the end of their lives they had only about two years of retirement often due to ill health as the century turned however more americans began to enjoy leisure time before they died many older couples survived on civil war veterans pensions and beginning in 1935 on welfare benefits for the elderly followed by social security after world war ii companies began to lure and keep workers by providing them with pensions which often encouraged workers to retire before 65 notes jack vanderhei director of research at ebri responding to such signals twentieth century workers got used to the idea of retiring but a reversal began in the 1980s as retirement ages for men started to rise men today retire at 64 on average up from 62 two decades ago munnell has found women now retire at 62 but comparisons with previous eras are tricky since back then most married women didn t work throughout their lives in 2010 according to the u s census 62 percent of men aged 60 to 64 were either working or looking for work a significant increase from 56 percent a decade before among men 65 and older 22 percent were in the labor force up from 16 percent a decade earlier the change shows up in social security statistics too social security lets people retire as early as 62 but to get full benefits you have to be a few years older by the mid 2000s more than 20 percent of men were delaying collecting until they had reached full retirement age up from 17 percent in the mid eighties for women the figure had moved from 12 percent to 16 percent washington is partly responsible for the shift nearly three decades ago president reagan and the democratic congress enacted a law that gradually increased the age at which people could retire and get full benefits from 65 at the time to 67 in 2027 people retiring this year for example must be 66 to receive full benefits though a nixon era change gives them even higher benefits if they wait until 70 in 2000 president clinton and the republican congress added a further encouragement to work longer repealing a hefty tax slapped on those who chose to keep working while collecting social security as long as they waited until the full retirement age to collect the corporate world too has contributed to people s retiring later though in a different way moving from guaranteed lifetime pensions based on workers salaries to matching employees own retirement savings that encourages people to work longer in 1980 when the baby boomers were young 60 percent of private sector workers with retirement plans could rely on guaranteed employer pensions a decade later the figure was down to less than a third today it is 7 percent that doesn t include the 22 million americans who work for government many of whom will receive pensions when they retire so far people have changed their behavior only gradually but as those who have received the new signals during their entire working lives approach traditional retirement age it s probable that more and more of them will keep working making that outcome even more likely baby boomers have absorbed the cultural lesson that idleness isn t a good thing often from watching their parents stagnate in long retirements we don t believe we re reaching retirement age says hershel chicowitz who runs the baby boomer headquarters website and newsletter chicowitz thinks that many boomers will just keep working or start second careers as they enter old age the 2011 ebri survey backs him up 36 percent of the respondents figured that they d retire later than 65 a jump from 25 percent in 2006 and more than three times the 11 percent figure of 1991 three quarters of those surveyed said that they d work at least part time after retiring most people can work for a few more years maybe even a decade but they can t work forever barely a quarter of those aged 65 to 74 were in the workforce last year according to the census the number declines precipitously as you get into even older age groups to less than 9 percent of those aged 75 to 84 and less than 3 percent of the 85 and up bracket there s no way around it baby boomers will eventually have to retire and to do that they ll need more savings than they ve managed to accumulate this isn t to say that they won t have any income from social security as some politicians and pundits have warned as far back as i can remember people said don t count on social security it will be gone says chicowitz indeed a full 87 percent of workers told ebri last year that they feared social security cuts but the situation isn t quite that dire for decades until last year workers paid more into social security than retirees took out that trust fund of extra money amounting to 2 6 trillion went into a big pile of ious from the u s treasury helping the government spend money on everything besides social security from food stamps to national defense now social security s annual surpluses are turning into deficits to finance the annual deficits the system this year is turning to its trust fund but it will take a long time to exhaust the reserves the trust fund won t run dry until 2037 when the youngest boomer is 73 at that point if nobody has acted to reform social security a 24 percent reduction in benefits would kick in automatically but some kind of reform is almost certain after all those millions of boomers vote making it highly doubtful that washington would close the social security deficit entirely through slashing benefits even raising the early retirement age is unlikely if politicians were going to do that they would have done it in 1983 when the boomers were still young making such a move now would provoke well founded complaints that mandating a longer work life rather than merely encouraging it through incentives would unfairly harm workers who have done heavy labor all their lives reform isn t the impossible task that it seems either henry aaron the brookings institution s social security guru estimates that over the next 75 years social security will take in about 14 percent of payroll and send out about 16 percent minor adjustments are sufficient to close the funding gap he says of course as social security lends less and less to the treasury that will create a problem for the rest of the government which will find itself with a lot less money but as aaron also notes and as the standard poor s august downgrade of the u s credit rating reminded voters washington must confront that fiscal issue long before 2037 as alan glickstein a senior retirement consultant at benefits consultancy towers watson sums up incremental reforms will probably continue to modify social security but it will still exist and be recognizable in its current form social security will get poorer americans a good chunk of the way there in replacing preretirement income observes glickstein up to 90 percent of it for some retirees but middle class workers can t rely on social security to replace anywhere near their preretirement income social security replaces only about a third of earnings for retirees who made 55 000 a year with the figure falling to 15 percent for high five figure earners if americans don t save and invest enough today it could mean smashed dreams tomorrow as well as deflation for the broader economy as tens of millions retreat from consumption but there doesn t have to be a crisis says michael falcon head of retirement at j p morgan asset management for the united states and canada generally falcon says a retiree will need an annual income that s 80 percent of his preretirement income he adds that frequently we see a u shape with people spending lots of money in their early retirement on exotic trips less as they get older and less adventurous and then as they get really old lots of money again on health care hitting that 80 percent mark isn t impossible but it s certainly daunting recall that in 2007 the average family headed by younger boomers earned 64 200 in retirement such a couple will need 80 percent of that per year roughly 51 400 they ll get about 17 500 from social security if they stop working at 62 or 24 900 if they wait until 67 that leaves a gap of 26 500 to 33 900 but remember even after the market crash of 2008 the average younger boomer family had 145 400 in net worth if those assets grow by 5 percent annually for another two decades until they retire the couple will make up for about half of the gap can they come up with the remaining 15 000 or so retiring much later would help with social security providing 30 900 a year for those waiting until 70 an extra 6 000 annually above retirement at 67 some boomers will have additional income from a traditional pension though many of these accounts are modest as companies started freezing their contributions to such plans more than two decades ago for people without such pensions the answer even if it s only a partial one is to save as much as possible while they re still working falcon says that workers should be saving and investing a minimum of 10 percent and perhaps as much as 14 percent of their pretax income vanguard the mutual fund giant recommends 12 to 15 percent americans currently save only about 5 percent up from the near zero levels of half a decade ago but still nowhere near enough vanguard notes that including employer matches the average participant in the 401 k plans that it administers for employers contributes only about 9 percent of his income and that only about one third of its participants presently meet its suggested investment threshold additional saving may not close the entire gap but it can turn a catastrophic decline in living standards into a smaller adjustment of course looking at averages this way ignores the worst off in this case the millions of boomers who have saved nothing at all it s growing rather late for them washington has already taken modest steps toward encouraging people to save more in 2006 president george w bush signed a law that allowed employers to enroll workers in 401 k plans automatically so long as they didn t specifically opt out it s one of the best things congress has done to increase 401 k participation says vanderhei of ebri vanguard says that the change has led more people who earn less than 30 000 in particular to invest the nation needs a more dramatic shift from spending and borrowing to saving and investing however here the pols can use the tax code as a signal right now people can contribute only 5 000 a year before taxes to personal retirement accounts outside their employer plans a ridiculously low amount the government should invite people to save all they can eliminating the annual limit and imposing only a lifetime limit of 1 million those who don t like the 401 k plans that their employers provide or simply want to save more outside those plans would then have a substantive choice the president and congress should also eliminate capital gains dividends and interest taxes on anyone say earning less than 250 000 a year since these taxes discourage people from investing washington must be sure though not to encourage everyone to invest in the same thing simultaneously as happened during the clinton era when the government eliminated capital gains taxes on home sales for middle class earners but not on any other types of investments if everyone buys the same thing its price goes so high that eventually it has to crash the bush administration s 2006 pension reform law is troubling in this regard by the way since it favors the target date fund through which investors target the year they d like to retire and let investment managers choose a mix of stocks bonds and other assets based on that date such funds can be a useful tool but with so many boomers expecting to retire on the same target date there s a real risk that fund managers will find themselves buying and selling the same classes of securities simultaneously workers need to invest more but also need to earn better returns in fact an 8 percent return on existing investments rather than 5 percent would solve much of the problem for younger boomers it s good news then that the average 401 k investor has stuck to stocks even though they ve had a bad decade as of 2010 vanguard points out its investors aged 45 to 54 had 73 percent of their accounts in stock or the stock portions of mixed funds for 55 to 64 year old investors the figure was 61 percent those numbers have stayed pretty much the same since the financial crisis began meaning that people have largely done what they re supposed to do during times of upheaval which is not to panic and sell vanguard chalks up some of the sanguinity to middle aged investors memories of the 1983 2000 bull market they believe that gains are possible if they sit tight if the government simply stuck with shoring up social security and modifying the tax code to encourage investment and avoided getting heavily involved in other areas of retirement retirees would likely benefit grown more confident that social security would always be their fallback americans might be more willing to invest their other retirement money even after they ve stopped working and thus create additional income for themselves the biggest unknowable risk for future retirees is health care vanderhei notes that if you take health costs into account a retiree may need not 80 percent of his preretirement income but more than 100 percent of it the problem isn t so much regular or even catastrophic costs which medicare and supplementary insurance cover it s long term care nursing homes for the elderly with dementia for example and in home care for people whose frailty keeps them from caring for themselves medicare does not cover such costs medicaid does but medicaid requires its beneficiaries to be practically speaking poor of course you will be poor after shelling out for a nursing home for a while but so will your surviving spouse who will have to live in severely straitened circumstances for the rest of his or her life if you look hard enough you can purchase long term care insurance while you re still young and healthy it s expensive though partly because insurance companies are suspicious of their customers recognizing that those who buy this protection probably have a reason for it someone who knows that his parents spent a long time in nursing homes for example is more likely to buy care insurance than someone whose parents were healthy until the end potential customers return the suspicion as three national bureau of economic research fellows determined in a recent paper many americans fear that they could spend money on insurance premiums for long term care only to watch the insurance companies go bust 20 years down the road as events during the recent recession illustrate long term contracts are not always honored the authors write the risk of insurance companies going bankrupt may be reason why demand for long term care insurance is limited one reasonable sounding solution would be for the government to guarantee such contracts yet the logical way to do it would be folding them into the government s own insurance program medicare which would require raising medicare premiums significantly for the time being that s a political nonstarter the best thing for now may be to take advantage of the fact that medicaid is a state administered program and to encourage states to experiment more congress should reward states that save money and improve treatment perhaps allowing someone who cares for an infirm spouse to purchase care directly aided by a government matching sum such reforms may be inevitable in fact since it s impossible for almost any retiree to make over 100 percent of his preretirement income moreover the boomers are likely to resist bankrupting themselves for miserable care i don t see the boomer generation sitting in some nursing home says chicowitz as demand for long term care changes supply will have to change too america has significant retirement problems but we may still be better off than the rest of the world the u s challenge of financing the transition of the baby boomers into retirement is modest compared to the demographic challenge faced by most other high income countries write brookings scholars barry bosworth and kent weaver in a recent paper though our proportion of the working aged to the retired will decrease the fall will be less dramatic than in other developed countries the nation in 2030 will have 204 million citizens of working age still nearly three times the number of those 65 and older whatever happens it s not going to be the static crisis that spreadsheets would predict as the boomers were born they sparked the construction not just of homes but of entire towns and school districts as they went to work they created day care centers for their children as they age they ll surely continue to change the economy though the effects are hard to predict when boomers exchange their bigger houses for smaller ones house prices may fall even more than they already have helping younger americans to use their own savings more productively and generating more wealth when boomers leave the workforce wages for younger people may rise pressuring supply to keep up with demand retirees may support younger generations just as the homemakers who stayed out of the workforce half a century ago contributed to the economy with their unpaid labor by babysitting their grandchildren freeing up mothers to work and perhaps encouraging higher fertility instead of selling their homes boomers may invite younger generations to come live with them the most disturbing statistic on older worker employment is this in 2010 only 77 6 percent of men 55 to 59 years old were working or looking for work down from 78 5 percent in 2007 and 79 1 percent in 1999 hammered by the slumping economy late middle aged folks have increasingly dropped out of the workforce and waited to start collecting social security in 2009 only 14 percent of new male social security beneficiaries were of full retirement age a precipitous fall from the 26 percent figure of the previous year it was the lowest rate ever unless older unemployed people get back to work soon they ll never go back and they ll become poorer retirees than they needed to be what this means is that fixing our economy now is the most important task of all let the housing market find its bottom so that people who want to cut losses on bad housing debt have the information they need to make such a momentous decision invest massively in infrastructure fix the tax code to channel money out of debt and into innovation fix immigration so that we continue to attract the world s smartest people these measures would get people back to work soon and prepare the nation better for the future making it likelier that those who will shoulder the burden of caring for an aging population are able to do it top photo sompong liabsanthia istock

debt issuance cost amortization similar adjustments attributable to our non controlling interests and certain tax related items although adjusted net income is not calculated in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap this non gaap measure is integral to the company s reporting and planning processes and the chief operating decision maker of the company uses segment adjusted operating income to allocate resources among our operating segments the company considers this measure integral because it excludes the above specified items that the company s management excludes in evaluating the company s performance specifically in addition to evaluating the company s performance on a gaap basis management evaluates the company s performance on a basis that excludes the above items because exclusion of the non cash mark to market adjustments on financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and investment securities helps management identify and assess trends in the company s underlying business that might otherwise be obscured due to quarterly non cash earnings fluctuations associated with these financial instruments net foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the remeasurement to functional currency of cash receivable and payable balances certain intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies and any gain or loss on foreign currency hedges relating to these items the exclusion of these items helps management compare changes in operating results between periods that might otherwise be obscured due to currency fluctuations the company considers certain acquisition related costs including certain financing costs investment banking fees warranty and indemnity insurance certain integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles as well as gains and losses from divestitures to be unpredictable dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired or divested business or the company in addition the size and complexity of an acquisition which often drives the magnitude of acquisition related costs may not be indicative of such future costs the company believes that excluding acquisition related costs and gains or losses of divestitures facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the company s historical operating results and to other companies in our industry stock based compensation is different from other forms of compensation as it is a non cash expense for example a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost in contrast the expense associated with an equity based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee and the cost to the company is based on a stock based compensation valuation methodology and underlying assumptions that may vary over time restructuring and other costs are related to certain identified initiatives to further streamline the business improve the company s efficiency create synergies and to globalize the company s operations all with an objective to improve scale and increase profitability going forward this also includes other immaterial costs that the company has incurred and are non operational and non recurring we exclude these items when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization are unrelated to the continuing operations of the company debt restructuring costs are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business in addition since debt issuance cost amortization is dependent upon the financing method which can vary widely company to company we believe that excluding these costs helps to facilitate comparison to historical results as well as to other companies within our industry the adjustments attributable to non controlling interests including adjustments to the redemption value of a non controlling interest have no significant impact on the ongoing operations of the business the tax related items are the difference between the company s u s gaap tax provision and a pro forma tax provision based upon the company s adjusted net income before taxes as well as the impact from certain discrete tax items the methodology utilized for calculating the company s adjusted net income tax provision is the same methodology utilized in calculating the company s u s gaap tax provision for the same reasons wex believes that adjusted net income may also be useful to investors as one means of evaluating the company s performance however because adjusted net income is a non gaap measure it should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to net income operating income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap in addition adjusted net income as used by wex may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the table below shows the impact of certain macro factors on reported revenue
