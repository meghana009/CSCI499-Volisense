on tuesday president trump delivered his second state of the union address the president highlighted job growth and economic progress including a list of trade measures taken in the past year and the direction he envisions for future trade relationships in his address he requested that congress give him more power over tariff imposition and u s trade relationships with china canada and mexico this glimpse into the administration s priorities helps to assess the upcoming year s agenda and analyze what barriers stand in the way of achieving those measures q1 what was said about trade in the state of the union a1 president trump mourned the united states decades of calamitous trade policies that allowed countries like china and deals like the north american free trade agreement nafta to take advantage of us he explained that with his presidency comes a new era of trade policies that will no longer permit other countries to steal u s jobs and wealth in china s case that involves intellectual property theft and the specific targeting of u s industries the tariffs imposed on chinese goods he argued raise billions of dollars for the government though in actuality tariff revenue has only raised 6 billion compared to the 12 billion government bailout to farmers due to tariff retaliation he discussed the ongoing trade negotiations with china saying that the solution must include real structural change that will prioritize u s jobs and focus on balancing the u s trade deficit in the case of nafta trump applauded the formation of the new united states mexico canada agreement usmca and urged congress to ratify it with the objective of creating more goods that are made in the usa trump explained that the usmca and a better trade agreement with china would create more jobs and protect intellectual property as well as asking congress to ratify the usmca president trump urged the passage of the united states reciprocal trade act which gives the executive branch power to impose reciprocal tariffs the official response to the state of the union given by former georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams only mentioned trade once saying we owe more to the millions of everyday folks who keep our economy running like the farmers caught in a trade war the spanish language response delivered by california state attorney general xavier becerra did not mention trade q2 what do his remarks signal about the administration s trade agenda a2 trump s requirement of structural changes to china s economy for a trade deal to occur helps to clarify the priorities of further trade negotiations with china for the public and congress these structural changes could include provisions ending heavy subsidization of state owned enterprises and a state backed industrial policy increasing intellectual property protection and ending forced technology transfer and joint venture requirements for foreign companies to do business in china some factors may pressure president trump into making a quick deal with china that does not require structural changes to the chinese economy this pressure may continue to increase as trump looks ahead to his 2020 reelection prospects and the economy feels the negative effects of the trade war the president could spin as a win a quick deal that only includes chinese purchases of u s goods but does not require changes to the chinese economy that could help stabilize president trump s base including farmers and manufacturers who are bearing negative consequences of his trade deal to reposition him as a skilled negotiator after the messy government shutdown and lead to a stock market uptick in the past china hawks in the trump administration including white house trade adviser peter navarro and u s trade representative robert lighthizer as well as industry experts were concerned that trump would be too hasty in securing a deal compromising on structural changes in exchange for shorter term market access after the state of the union however broad concessions are less likely as president trump publicly promised to reduce the trade deficit and protect u s jobs through mandating chinese structural change this all does not even touch upon the significant domestic pushback in china of a foreign power demanding it fundamentally restructure its economy nor does it consider china s likely unwillingness to reform its economy in a way that weakens the communist party s control over it according to congressional leadership the ratification of usmca will be an uphill battle for the trump administration it will be a highly contested issue in the upcoming year as trump will have to negotiate with critics and skeptics from both sides of the aisle in congress concerns including environmental and labor standards enforcement pharmaceutical pricing section 232 tariffs and arbitration procedures will likely make negotiations with congress a slow and complicated process the proposed united states reciprocal trade act usrta gives power to the executive branch to raise tariffs for a country that levies a higher tariff on the same good for example european duties on u s cars are 10 percent compared to the united states 2 5 percent level on european cars usrta would allow president trump to increase the u s tariff rate on european cars to 10 percent experts say that by focusing on the tariff rates for individual products the usrta ignores the larger picture of rates while europe has higher tariff rates on u s cars the united states has higher tariff rates on european trucks though the united states has low tariff rates on certain goods on average its tariff rates are on par with the other large economies including germany and the united kingdom as well the mercatus center reported that reciprocity is likely to ensnare the united states in tit for tat tariff spats harming u s consumers and businesses and raising the average tariff on u s imports from 2 1 percent to 5 4 percent there have been previous pieces of legislation that expand the president s powers over imposing tariffs sans congressional approval the trading with the enemy act of 1917 helped president nixon to impose a 10 percent tariff on all imports the international emergency economic powers act of 1977 was used by presidents clinton and carter against iran during national states of emergency section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 was ratified to allow the president to impose tariffs that the secretary of commerce sees as impacting national security the trade act of 1974 gave the president power to impose duties on countries whose exports create significant adverse effects for u s businesses and consumers the usrta furthers the principle of retaliation outlined in section 301 of the trade act of 1974 like the usrta section 301 uses tariffs to force other countries to depart from their protectionist policies rather than to protect their domestic markets the traditional rationale for protectionist measures usrta also shares parallels with the reciprocal trade agreement act of 1934 rtaa the rtaa was a response to the smoot hawley tariff laws of 1930 protectionist legislation that drastically increased import duties it attempted to reduce the barriers to initiating tariff reduction by giving the president the power to negotiate bilateral tariff reduction agreements while representative duffy r wi who introduced usrta claims that usrta like the rtaa aims to encourage the rest of the world to lower their the usrta focuses on giving the president the power to increase not decrease tariffs in the same way as the trade act of 1974 incentivizing by force instead of agreement the original rtaa ended with the ratification of the doha round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1994 the doha round passed the most favored nation mfn principle of nondiscrimination outlawing different tariff rates on similar products from different countries apart from in the case of free trade agreements while the principle of mfn solved the same problem that the rtaa was attempting to ease reducing tariff rates the new usrta would abandon mfn giving the president the power to levy discriminatory tariff rates on individual countries and breaking world trade organization s wto rules q3 can the administration follow through on its trade agenda a3 the trump administration faces a number of challenges to implementing the trade agenda laid out at the state of the union with a democratic controlled house of representatives implementing legislation for the usmca and the reciprocal trade act will be more difficult to pass with the 2020 election rising to the forefront trump feels increasing pressure to fulfill promises and prove himself as a negotiator but a democratic house may be less inclined to hand him any wins negotiating a deal with significant structural reform to the chinese economy will continue to prove difficult neither china nor the united states has the power to unilaterally decide the terms of the trade agreement the inevitable compromise must contain concessions the trade war has spanned more than 200 days and five negotiation sessions yet has failed to produce significant headway on structural reforms president trump s negotiation failure during the government shutdown may be interpreted as a sign of weakness by the chinese causing them to resist compromise in hopes that they can reach a more favorable outcome in addition pressure continues to mount on trump to achieve a deal though being tough on china at the state of the union shows commitment to a serious deal a choppy stock market concerns over long term global growth and the heartland shouldering the downsides of the trade war may weaken trump s resolve farmers continue to feel the negative effects of the trade war as they approach planting season if they continue to suffer it will be difficult for trump to draw out an agreement as farmers make up a significant portion of trump s base president trump will face even more pressure to come to a quick agreement if the economy sours slowing u s growth in exchange for an ongoing stalemate with china would not help trump s reelection efforts the road ahead for the ratification of the usmca also has significant barriers in addition to the politics of resisting the optics of assisting trump to fulfill a core campaign promise democrats have concerns about the actual content of the agreement these include the leniency of drug price provisions and the weakness of labor and environmental standards enforcement additionally some republicans are unhappy with the agreement in its current form many demand changes to the investor state dispute settlement rules and republican members have also demanded ending the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum before voting on usmca to pass the usmca the trump administration will need to balance the priorities of both sides a process that is expected to be long and difficult despite president trump s endorsement of the usrta it is very unlikely to get congressional approval currently there are multiple bipartisan bills to curb presidential power to levy tariffs these include a bill from senator toomey r pa and senator warner d va that would require congressional approval for tariffs enacted because of national security concerns and a bill from senator portman r oh and senator jones d al that would preserve some executive powers but increase legislative oversight of national security related tariffs all three of these bills are likely to fail as neither of the executive power limiting bills have enough support to override trump s veto and the executive power enhancing bill does not have the support it needs in congress to pass this stalemate means that the status quo on power to impose tariffs is likely to hold william reinsch holds the scholl chair in international business at the center for

february 07 2019 by peter koenig for the saker blog venezuela in the limelight on practically all the written audio and visual mainstream media as well as alternative media a purposeful constant drip of outright lies and half truths fake news as well as misleading information of all shades and hues about venezuela is drumming our brains slowly bending our minds towards believing that yes the us has a vital interest in meddling in venezuela and bringing about regime change because of primarily the huge reserves of oil but also of gold coltan and other rare minerals and finally simply because washington needs full control of its backyard but and yes there is a huge but as even some of the respected progressive alternative media pretend to know amidst all that recognition of the anglozionist empire s evil hands in venezuela their but claims that venezuela specifically presidents chavez and now maduro are not blameless in their economic chaos this distorts already the entire picture and serves the empire and all those who are hesitant because they have no clue whom to support in this antagonistic us attempt for regime change for example one alternative news article starts it is true that some of venezuela s economic problems are due to the ineptitudes of the bolivarian government s socialist command economy but this overlooks the role played by the united states the united nations and the european union bingo with such a low blow beginning the uninformed reader is already primed to discount much of the interference by washington and its minions some of the so called progressive writers have already been brain smeared by calling nicolás maduro a dictator when in fact there is hardly any country farther away from a dictatorship than venezuela in the last 20 years and since comandante hugo chavez frias was first elected in 1998 and came to power in 1999 venezuela had another 25 fully democratic elections of which 6 took place in the last year and a half they were all largely observed by the us based carter institute the latin american celac some were even watched by the european union eu the very vassal states that are now siding with washington in calling president maduro an illegitimate dictator and instead they side with and support the real illegitimate never elected us trained and appointed juan guaidó former president carter once said of all the elections he and his institute observed the ones in venezuela were by far the most transparent and democratic ones by september 2017 the carter center had observed 104 elections in 39 countries despite this evidence washington paid and corrupted anglozionist msm are screaming and spreading lies election fraud and nicolás maduro is illegal a dictator oppressing his people depriving them of food and medication sowing famine he has to go such lies are repeated at nauseatum in a world flooded by pyramid dollars fake money the presstitute media have no money problem dollars the funding source for the massive lie propaganda are just printed as debt never to be repaid again so why worry the same zionists who control the media also control the western money machines i e the fed wall street the bis bank for international settlement the so called central bank of central banks the european central bank the bank of england and the banks of london the western public armchair warriors all the way to caviar socialists believe these lies that s how our unqualified brains apparently work a recent independent poll found that 86 of all venezuelans including from the opposition want no interference by the us and her puppet allies but want to remain a sovereign state deciding themselves on how to resolve their internal problem economics and otherwise let me tell you something if mr maduro would be a dictator and all the diabolical adjectives that he is smeared with were to apply he would have long ago stopped the western propaganda machine which is the western controlled media in venezuela they control 90 of the news in venezuela but he didn t and doesn t because he believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the media even if the media are really nothing more than abject western lie machines presstitute mr maduro is generous enough not to close them down which any dictator of which there are now many in latin america take a pick argentina chile ecuador brazil colombia paraguay uruguay guatemala honduras would have done long ago from the very beginning when hugo chavez was first elected in 1998 washington attempted to topple him to bring about régime change the first real coup attempt took place on 11 april 2002 under full command by washington chavez was ousted for less than 2 days when an on swell of people and the vast majority of the military requested his reinstatement chavez was brought back from his island seclusion and thus the directly washington led coup d état was defeated the revolution will not be televised but the pressure mounted with economic sanctions becoming ever bolder and in the case of venezuela they had severe economic and humanitarian impacts because venezuela imports close to 90 of her food and medication still today and most of it from the us both chavez and maduro had very little leeway of doing differently what they have already done sanctions boycotts outside money manipulations driving inflation to astronomical levels and constant smear propaganda these predicaments are biting hard the us has a firm grip on venezuela s dollar dependency last week washington confiscated about us 23 billion venezuela s reserve money in us banks blocked them from use by the legitimate maduro government and instead handed them to their us appointed puppet never elected president juan guaidó he is now able to use venezuela s money in his us eu and lima group supported shadow government will he dare i don t think so however he has already invited us petro companies to come to venezuela and invest in and take over the petrol industry of course it will not happen as president maduro stays in power firmly backed by the military all of this sounds like a bad joke did you ever heard of juan guaidó before the us and her european vassals almost unanimously and obediently aped washington in supporting him likewise the bank of england withheld 1 2 billion dollars worth of venezuelan reserve gold refusing to respond to the maduro government s request to return the gold to caracas both cases represent an extreme breach of confidence up to now it was ethically commercially and financially unthinkable that reserve money and gold deposited in foreign banks would not be safe from hooligan theft because that s what it is what the us is doing stealing other countries money that was deposited in good fate in their banks in a recent interview with rt president maduro said there was absolutely no need for humanitarian aid as the un suggested prompted by the us this so called humanitarian aid has everywhere in the world only served to infiltrate foreign and destabilizing elements into countries just look at syria libya iraq afghanistan to name just a few while the us 23 billion blocked in new york banks could have supplied venezuela with 20 years worth of medication for the venezuelan people maduro asserted venezuela has enough liquidity to feed and medicate her people however what this latest trump plunder the money and gold confiscation does is hammering one more nail in the western monetary system s suicide coffin it sends an ever clearer signal to the rest of the world to those that haven t noticed yet the anglozionist empire cannot i repeat cannot be trusted ever and the european union is intrinsically and vassalically linked to the washington rogue state not to be trusted either there is virtually no circumstance under which a countries assets in western foreign lands as bank deposits or foreign investments are safe it will prompt a move away from the dollar system away from the western also entirely privately owned swft international transfer system by which sanctions can be enacted indeed the russia and china and much of the sco shanghai organization cooperation members are no longer dealing in us dollars but in their own currencies we are talking about half the world s population broke free from the dollar hegemony europe has started a half assed attempt to circumvent the dollar and swift system for dealing with iran europe s special purpose vehicle or spv is called instex short for instrument in support of trade exchanges it is a project of germany france and the uk suspiciously chaired by the latter to be endorsed by all 28 eu members it aims in a first instance at shipping humanitarian aid to iran similarly to venezuela iran s foreign minister javad zarif after learning about the details considered the conditions of instex as insulting and rejected any dealings with europe under this system iran he said does not need humanitarian aid not from europe not from anybody in the meantime what was to be expected has already happened the trump administration issued a stern warning of sanctions to the eu if they would attempt to deal with iran outside of the dollar system europe is likely caving in as they always do back in venezuela the ned national endowment for democracy the extended arm of the cia has for the last two decades trained funded and infiltrated traitor agents into venezuela with the goal to assist the opposition to foment unrest to carry out assassinations and other false flags and to simply create chaos and unrest however some of these agents are also lodged in venezuela s financial institutions as the fifth column where they sabotage often with threats any economic policies that could rescue venezuela from its economic predicament in june 2017 i was privileged to be a member of an economic advisory team to mr maduro during three days of intense discussions with government a number of potential short medium and long term solutions emerged they were well received by mr maduro and his economic team what became of these recommendations well maybe there are strong foreign directed forces at play to prevent their implementation clearly any accusation that the maduro government may bear the blame for some of the economic chaos have to be vigorously rejected mr maduro has very little space to maneuver the economy other than what he is already doing his actions are severely limited by the ever stronger squeeze by western claws with or without venezuela s new crypto currency the oil based petro the venezuelan economy including a major proportion of her imports is strongly linked to the us dollar with military threats and sanctions left and right there is little that the government can do in the immediate future to become autonomous yes russia and especially china will most likely help with balance of payment support loans with investments in the oil industry to ease venezuela s us dollar debt burden and vamp up oil production and in the medium and longer run they may also help boosting venezuela s agricultural sector towards 100 food self sufficiency what is the real reason you may ask behind trump s intense coup d état attempt aka bolton pompeo and elliott abrams the regime change envoy or the diabolical troika s killer mission is it oil and other natural riches like gold coltan diamonds and many more rare minerals venezuela with some 301 000 mmbbl billions of barrels of known reserves has about 12 more hydrocarbon reserves than saudi arabia shipping from the gulf to texas refineries takes 40 45 days and the risk of passing through the iran controlled strait of hormuz delivering oil from venezuela to texas takes some 2 4 days is it that venezuela committed a mortal sin when circumventing the petro dollar when trading her hydrocarbons notably with china and russia in other currencies like the gold convertible yuan remember saddam hussein and muamar gadhafi attempted similar dollar escaping actions and look what it brought them the us dollar hegemony depends very much on oil and gas trade in us dollars as per an agreement of the seventies between the us and saudi arabia head of opec is it that washington cannot tolerate any socialist or socialist leaning country in its backyard cuba and nicaragua beware is venezuela a crucial stepping stone to fully dominate latin america and her resources and hence a step closer to full power dominance of the world or all of the above i believe it s all of the above with a strong accent on venezuela s abandoning the us dollar as hydrocarbon trading currency putting the dollar hegemony even more at risk once the dollar ceases to be the main reserve currency the us economy will slowly collapse what it is already doing twenty years ago the us dollar dominated world reserve coffers with about 90 today that proportion has sunk to less than 60 the dollar is rapidly being replaced by other currencies notably the chinese yuan now let s cut to the chase it is clear that the trump administration with these stupid actions of dishing out sanctions left and right punishing allies and foes alike if they deal with russia iran or venezuela and this special blunt regime change aggression in venezuela nominating a 35 year old us puppet trained in the us by cia as venezuela s new interim president confiscating venezuela s reserve assets in new york and london stopping importing petrol from venezuela and punishing anybody who imports venezuelan oil except of course russia and china the might of the us stops short of interfering in these non dollar deals with these and more ridiculous actions and military threats washington is actually not only isolating itself but is accelerating the fall of the us economy ever more countries are seeking alternative ways of doing business with currencies and monetary systems other than the dollar based fraudulent swift and eventually they will succeed all they need to do is joining the china russia sco system of transfer in their local currencies and the currencies of the eastern sco block and dedollarization is moving a step further ahead dedollarization is the key to the end of the us dollar hegemony of the us economic supremacy the arrogant trump plus the impunity of the unfettered diabolical and outright dumb bolton pompeo abrams

corp s statutory tax rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent see item h below for further discussion of our effective tax rate b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for both the fourth quarter and full year primarily due to the following a decrease in electric revenue related to the federal income tax law changes the above decrease was partially offset by increases in retail electric rates due to general rate increases in idaho and washington customer growth which contributed additional retail electric revenue during 2018 and the pre tax benefit under the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington decreased from a 1 0 million pre tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2017 to a 0 5 million pre tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2018 the pre tax benefit increased from 4 6 million for the full year 2017 to 6 1 million for the full year 2018 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for both the fourth quarter and full year primarily due to the following a decrease in natural gas revenue related to the federal income tax law changes the above decrease was partially offset by general rate increases in washington idaho and oregon and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in 2018 d other operating expenses decreased for the fourth quarter of 2018 but increased for the full year 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily due to decreases in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance costs primarily related to the timing of expenses for the full year 2018 there were increases in generation and distribution operating costs e transaction costs were 1 1 million pre tax for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 6 6 million pre tax for the fourth quarter of 2017 transaction costs for the full year 2018 were 3 7 million pre tax compared to 14 6 million pre tax for the full year 2017 the transaction costs decreased for the fourth quarter and full year because 2018 consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2017 included consulting banking fees legal fees and employee time none of the transaction costs are being passed through to customers f depreciation and amortization increased for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 due to additions to utility plant g interest expense increased for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 due to additional outstanding debt during 2018 as compared to 2017 h during the fourth quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was 15 8 percent compared to 53 1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and it was 16 0 percent for the full year 2018 compared to 41 7 percent for 2017 the effective tax rate decreased during 2018 primarily due to federal income tax law changes which were enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017 which lowered the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent additionally during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the federal tax law changes we revalued deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal income tax rate which resulted in a 10 2 million adjustment to income tax expense in 2017 of this income tax expense amount 7 5 million related to avista utilities and 2 7 million related to our other businesses reflected in j below i ael p earnings decreased slightly for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous expenses as well as a decrease in sales volumes to residential and commercial customers primarily during the fourth quarter of 2018 j losses at our other businesses decreased during 2018 as 2017 included a one time tax expense in the fourth quarter from revaluing deferred taxes to the new tax rate of 21 percent as a result of federal income tax law changes this was partially offset by increased expenses associated with a renovation project in 2018 impairment losses and an increase in equity method losses on our investments non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following

statutory tax rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent liquidity and capital resources 2018 liquidity transactions we have a 400 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 as of dec 31 2018 we had 199 million of available liquidity under this committed line of credit we also had 25 million of available liquidity under ael p s committed line of credit that expires in november 2019 during 2018 we issued 375 million of long term debt in the form of first mortgage bonds 2019 liquidity expectations in january 2019 we received the 103 million termination fee from hydro one for the purpose of reimbursing our transaction costs including the related income taxes of 51 million incurred from 2017 to 2019 the balance of the termination fee will be used for general corporate purposes and reduces our need for external financing after consideration of the net termination fee received from hydro one in 2019 we expect to issue approximately 165 million of long term debt and up to 50 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures avista utilities capital expenditures were 419 million for 2018 and we expect avista utilities capital expenditures to be about 405 million for 2019 ael p s capital expenditures were 6 million for 2018 and we expect ael p s capital expenditures to be approximately 9 million for 2019 in addition we expect to invest about 19 million at our other businesses in 2019 this is mainly related to economic development projects in our service territory that will showcase the latest energy and environmental building innovations and house several local college degree programs 2019 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is initiating its 2019 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs due in part to the on going regulatory proceedings for the hydro one transaction we elected not to file any general rate cases during 2018 so the commissions could focus on the merger proceedings while we received a base rate increase effective january 1 2019 in idaho which was related to a rate plan approved by the idaho public utilities commission in 2017 we have not received base rate relief in oregon since november 1 2017 and have not received base rate relief in washington since may 1 2018 during 2017 and 2018 we continued to invest in our utility infrastructure to maintain and enhance our system however only limited portions of these costs are reflected in our current rates to customers as such we will experience regulatory lag during the period 2019 through 2021 due to the delay in general rate case filings and our continued investment in utility infrastructure we plan to file general rate cases in washington idaho and oregon during the first half of 2019 with requested effective dates in early 2020 to begin remedying the regulatory lag going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 and then our normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate following 2022 this assumes timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2019 earnings guidance range encompasses unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2019 guidance range includes regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 105 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 5 percent in 2019 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 2 72 to 2 86 per diluted share for 2019 this includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 90 percent customer 10 percent company sharing band which is expected to add approximately 0 07 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the year for 2019 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 09 to 0 13 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the year we expect the other businesses to be between a loss of 0 03 and a loss of 0 01 per diluted share which includes costs associated with exploring strategic opportunities our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions dispositions until the effects are known and certain note we will host a conference call

year in addition the quarter included around 3 million related to organizational restructuring and a few million dollars of nonrecurring items these items weren t contemplated in our original guidance and aren t expected to be recurring continuing with our fourth quarter highlights adjusted operating income grew 14 year over year and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of 0 94 a 25 increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017 importantly that strong earnings growth combined with reduced capex spend generated record free cash flow of 2 3 billion up 32 versus the prior year i ll

in dividends we paid the capital return to shareholders during 2018 totaled nearly 1 8 billion that record capital return is 23 higher than last year and nearly double what we returned just a few years ago we did all of this while maintaining our target leverage and investing over 1 billion in strategic initiatives including fixed income mortgages and along with our partners the launch of bakkt the strong cash generation of our business model will continue to support our disciplined approach to investment and capital return once again in 2019 as we ve indicated in the past we re committed to growing our dividend as the company grows reflecting that commitment our board authorized a 15 increase in our quarterly dividend to 0 275 per share and as we noted on our third quarter

participants new products and the need for additional credit protection remain catalyst for that business turning next to slide 7 i ll discuss the data and listings segment fourth quarter data services revenue grew 6 on an organic constant currency basis to a record 539 million for the full year data services revenues grew 5 on an organic constant currency basis including 6 growth in products included in our asv which account for roughly 90 of our data services business within data services during the fourth quarter revenue from an exchange data and feeds grew 7 and desktops and connectivity grew 1 each on an organic constant currency basis please note that beginning with the fourth quarter we have moved our feeds business out of desktops and connectivity and into exchange data this better distinguishes the exchange related content we sell from our distribution capabilities and it provides a better comparison to our data services peers we ve provided a restatement of historical data services results to reflect this change in the appendix revenues from pricing and analytics which represent half of our data revenues and nearly a quarter of our total revenues were up 7 on an organic constant currency basis for the third consecutive quarter as you can see on the slide our pricing and analytics revenue growth has accelerated from nearly 4 5 in 2016 to more than 5 in 2017 and now to over 6 5 in 2018 this accelerating growth reflects contributions from every component of our revenue model new customers new products increased consumption from existing customers and targeted price increases and importantly asv for pricing and analytics entering 2019 is up 7 giving us confidence and continued momentum finally in our listings business revenues grew 8 in the fourth quarter and the nyse listed 16 ipos despite heightened market volatility and for the year we were once again the leading u s exchange in terms of capital formation helping our customers raise 30 billion in ipo proceeds i ll conclude my remarks on slide 8 on the left hand side of the slide you can see a recap of our strong 2018 performance revenues grew 7 adjusted operating income grew 8 adjusted earnings per share grew 21 and free cash flow grew 32 on the right hand side of the slide you ll note a few points of guidance for 2019 we expect full year data services revenues to be between 2 19 billion and 2 24 billion this includes 540 million to 545 million in the first quarter with sequential improvement each quarter thereafter this also reflects the impact of a stronger dollar versus both the euro and pound which is currently expected to reduce 2019 data revenues by roughly 5 million to 10 million and of note with no material data acquisitions in 2018 currency fluctuations is the only adjustment that should be required to calculate our 2019 data revenue growth moving next to expenses we anticipate full year adjusted operating expense to be between 2 15 billion and 2 2 billion 2018 acquisitions in our trading and clearing segment will generate roughly 35 million to 40 million in incremental expense net of around 15 million in actions already taken to reduce the costs of those acquired businesses in addition to the cost savings the expense will be more than offset by over 100 million of incremental revenue on top of the cost savings for the recently acquired businesses we will deliver the final 30 million of synergies related to idc which means we will have achieved our original commitment of 180 million in total synergies next consistent with past years we will once again reward our employees for their strong contribution as a part of our pay for performance philosophy which will increase compensation expense by 35 million to 40 million investments in technology as well as expenses tied to revenue growth will add around 30 million to 35 million and finally our investment in bakkt will generate 20 million to 25 million of expense based upon the run rate in the first quarter we will update you on progress at bakkt and the level of investment as we move through the year we delivered another record year in 2018 and we have momentum entering 2019 i ll be happy to take your questions during q a but for now i ll hand it to jeff to expand on our strategic plans entering the new year jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott and good morning to everyone on the call let me begin on slide 9 we re pleased to report what was the best year in ice s history and that marks our 13th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share our track record of growth is a testament to the strategic approach that we ve taken since our inception to build a globally diverse platform that enhances our customers workflows using technology to bring efficiency transparency and reliability to markets in our futures markets we re strategically positioned in major market centers around the world with six simple clearinghouses across north america the u k europe and asia it s a footprint that gives our customers choice helps insulate us from regulatory and political risk and provides a platform for product development that enables us to swiftly capitalize on growth opportunities as they emerge around the world our exchanges and clearinghouses operate on common technology providing our markets with the flexibility to move jurisdictions if desired often as quickly as over a weekend these markets run on proprietary technology designed to meet the comprehensive workflow need of a wide range of market participants on top of this technology and our global distribution are the critical benchmark contracts that traders investors and commercial participants rely upon to manage their everyday risks in our oil markets brent crude is the global benchmark for nearly two thirds of the internationally traded oil that moves around the world each day once again brent generated record revenues in 2018 and it remains a cornerstone of our energy product development as well as for customer acquisition and retention in our energy business brent s relevance to our oil complex is complimented by our gasoil contract gasoil s been one of the fastest growing energy benchmarks with open interest up 11 per annum on average over the last five years gasoil has become a key benchmark for the refined barrel including diesel and jet fuel and the upcoming imo marine fuel regulations which are set to take hold in 2020 could provide additional risk management tailwinds to our oil complex in our natural gas markets we offer a suite of liquid global benchmarks a platform that is unmatched in the marketplace in fact roughly two thirds of our natural gas revenue is now derived from products other than the u s henry hub a benchmark that is losing relevance to commercial customers as other global benchmarks grow as natural gas globalizes our customers participation in these markets have accelerated with open interest across our 58 north american natural gas spaces markets up 17 year over year our european ttf natural gas contract with open interest at near record levels up 64 year over year and with our jkm contract which is the benchmark for asian natural gas achieving record trading volumes in january we see a similar dynamic in our financial futures business which includes european interest rates and equity indices brexit uncertainty and the shifting expectations around global economic growth continue to drive increased hedging activities with interest rate average daily volumes increasing 14 year over year and open interest up 8 through the end of january and our alternative interest rate complex is also benefiting from increased adoption with over 1 6 trillion of notional cleared in our sonia products since its launch just over a year ago in our equities futures business average daily volume in our msci index has grown at a cagr of 34 since 2014 and was up 40 in january in particular as trade tensions in the u s and china continue to build so too is open interest in the msci emerging market index as of the end of january open interest stood at 1 4 million contracts and for comparison purposes this represents over 20 of the total notional outstanding in the s p 500 e mini contract an amount which was less than 5 only five years ago in addition to our futures markets we re continuously working to bring efficiencies transparency and reliability to the u s cash equities markets at the nyse we ve been rolling out our pillar technology a technology that has the capacity to handle 80 billion messages a day and which should improve the customer execution and access experience to our seven distinct equities trading venues when combined with our hybrid designated market maker model we provide customers with a differentiated platform that reduces volatility provides tighter bid offer spreads and offers an all in cost to trade that is significantly lower than the average dark pool or dark venue like the iex exchange our model of compensating designated market makers to protect and manage stocks is a unique value proposition that shines brightest amid market volatility such as we ve seen in december as the average quoted spreads on nyse listed and traded stocks were approximately 100 excuse me 180 basis points tighter and volatility was over 50 lower on the open and 60 lower on the close than our closest listing competitor and finally in our data services business we continue to build on our unique platform as the leading provider of mission critical derived data and analytics the results of these efforts are best illustrated by the performance in our pricing and analytics business which grew nearly 7 in 2018 demand for our pricing and reference data analytics and indices is accelerating active managers continue to search for better tools and data to drive output as there s a shift toward passive investing which continues these two trends have provided a tailwind to our business in particular to our index business at the end of january following the transition of the ishares preferred stock etf ice had 175 billion of fixed income etf assets tracking our indices a whopping 80 increase from just a year ago turning to slide 10 as i noted at the beginning of my prepared remarks 2018 was yet another record year for ice a strong top line contribution from our transaction business was complemented by compounding growth in our data and listings business coupled with strong expense management and our synergy execution we produced double digit eps growth reinforcing our conviction that we have in our long term strategy and as we look to 2019 and beyond we re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead not only for our core business but also for newer initiatives such as ice mortgage services our fixed income businesses and bakkt which recently raised over 180 million in its first round of funding i d like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2018 and i want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to yet another very strong year for ice i ll now turn the call back to our operator kerry and she ll conduct the question and answer session until 9 30 eastern time operator the first question will come from rich repetto of sandler o neill please go ahead rich repetto sandler o neill analyst good morning jeff good morning scott i guess my question s going to be a broad question on some of the external sort of forces you re bumping into both in europe and the u s and i guess in europe when you look at brexit jeff you mentioned some of the benefits that people are needing to hedge more but could you overall give us a recap of where do you think you stand on brexit there s this issue of i know the tax on commodities potentially being forced by the eu and then in the u s the external forces where these ideas of compete new competing exchange as well as the scrutiny on data do you think that that we can move on beyond that or what points would you highlight to investors in those areas jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer well welcome to my world rich you basically asked me to describe my job so let s start with brexit first of all as you ve mentioned unfortunately we benefit from brexit because the volatility that government actions impose on companies force them to manage their risk and we re in the risk management business so there s really an overarching positive impact on our revenues and income that said as you know we ve long felt that we shouldn t consolidate all our businesses geographically and we have a trading and clearing operation in the u k and we also have a trading and clearing operation in the eu and we put both of them on common technologies so that we have to move business around it s really just a database move inside of our company and not a physical move and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks that s something we can do over a weekend that said there s a lot of political back and forth going on including now revisiting tax issues on the tax issues specifically this has been going on for over a decade it s remanded to the courts now the eu courts in 21 months or so the u k theoretically is no longer bound by the eu courts so i don t know that it s going this is going to have any practical impact other than another negotiating ploy that s going on over a complicated relationship between the u k and the eu as it relates to brexit it s something that we everybody and our whole industry has lived with forever but ice has always maintained the optionality to move contracts and to locate business where our customers want to be and if certain things would have to move or be relocated in order to map and minimize the impact of that we certainly would do that we ll take our cue from the industry with respect to the u s and the members exchange let me just set the table if i could because for some reason there seems to be an incredible amount of concern about this press release you have to go back to a decade or so when we ve had the automation of trading particularly in the equities world we had the flash boys book in the flash boys phenomenon and as a result of that we saw the sec a couple of years ago order the exchanges to do what they called a tick pilot which was essentially widen out or narrow the spreads of certain stocks to see how they would trade and really what that is doing is affecting the behavior of the high frequency traders that make their income by trying to capture the bid offer spread that pilot has finished and the data s being analyzed and you next see the sec trying to promulgate something called a fee pilot it s not that well named in my mind because it actually doesn t impact the fees or the capture rate of the exchanges but it changes theoretically over a number of different buckets the amount of rebate that can be paid to high frequency market making firms and brokers there are a lot of people in our industry that are looking at the retail equity market and saying the next leg of that stool if one follows the sec s actions maybe to investigate and change the way retail chain for order flow operates and which i think you know that retail order flow that comes through retail brokers is largely sold directly to high frequency market makers it never goes to exchanges and what we saw is a group of high frequency market makers that participate in the retail space organized up all of the retail brokers that they pay these fees to and try to quickly move to set up an exchange that we believe is to try to get in front of what may be the trend of eliminating and changing their business model now for us at the new york stock exchange unfortunately we don t see any of that retail order flow we don t believe that that the behavior impacts us at all in fact to the extent that those orders are not executed on after they re sold to the market makers the exhaust which are basically people consider to be toxic because these are bids and offers that are off market are routed to an exchange that is not us so we have very little impact with what s going on over there that said we believe that we support what they re doing and we ll not fight to what they re doing because we think it has still benefits to the new york stock exchange first of all we don t compete for any retail order flow and if the idea is that they re no longer going to be able to sell order flow directly to market makers and it s going to have to be public competition to the retail consumers for the best bid offer we would like to compete for that and if there s going to be a new exchange they think they can compete for we believe we could compete for we have among the lowest cost of trading all in cost of trading anywhere cheaper than dark pools cheaper than the newer exchanges that have formed up and we believe that the new exchange is going to have to cover its cost for us it s where we ll be incremental and we believe we could offer low cost trading that would be accretive to ice shareholders and very very competitive to the end user for the bid offer secondly a new exchange is going to continue to fragment order flow even if there are even if there s no business there bids and offers that are sent there are going to have to be viewed that s going to increase the capacity the network capacity needed to manage that that means the data spend wallet of end users is going to go up not down and we run networks and we can compete to provide that increased capacity that s in fact a big part of the growth of this business so we see the wallet going up and lastly one of the techniques that the sec uses to promulgate these changes is to essentially order the exchanges to adopt rules instead of going through a large public rule making where which takes a long time and have a lot of comments and difficulty getting through oftentimes the sec will just order the exchanges to adopt the rule given that we have rule making capability so this is the case for example in a consolidated audit trail the exchanges were ordered to build a consolidated audit trail by filing individual rules at each exchange that would allow that to happen there s a lot of complaints in the market over who got the vote on that consolidated audit trail for example people that were not exchanges didn t get a vote now we know the reason that the buy side and the sell side would like to have a vote is they want to make sure that they don t have to pay for it or that they can at least cap the costs in the consolidated audit trail case there is no budget it is an unlimited spend it is one of the most technically difficult projects that has ever been attempted in our industry managing billions and billions of data point that have consumer information that can be captured time stamped on an atomic clock and can be readily searchable for trends is a daunting challenge and it has been a huge spend on behalf of the exchanges so we would welcome others to come in and help to fray those costs and have a vote in that matter because they also would be pregnant with the obligations of that matter the recent exchanges have been fighting people having votes is that they don t have the underlying obligation so long story short we see that we may have an opportunity to compete for retail order flow we believe there s going to be an increase data wallet spend and we believe that this could finally align interest in the industry and so in that regard i don t see why in any event anyone should consider it a negative impact on our company i think it will ultimately accrue positive thank you for listening to that one winded answer but that is my role questions and answers operator the next question will come from ken worthington of jpmorgan please go ahead ken worthington j p morgan analyst hi good morning on the data side your asv is up 6 your revenue guide for 2019 is up 3 5 to a little under 6 can you help us bridge the gap between the two clearly fx is a part but i think some of the inflation scott gave show that it was really a small part so what are the other factors in the gap between asv and the data revenue guide and is baml where is baml in these figures now on the organic side and where is it not scott hill chief financial officer so ken first of all the guidance range we gave constant currency is roughly 4 to 6 year over year so just to take any concerns or questions out regarding what a constant currency guide is in those dollar terms if you think about asv at 6 if you remember that s 90 of our revenue as i said in my prepared remarks in 2018 our overall data business grew 5 our asv revenue grew 6 and so the elements that aren t inside asv things like nms session fees et cetera haven t been and we don t expect will become big growth drivers in the overall business so i actually think if you take the absolute value asv and you consider it as 90 of our revenue it gives you it pushes you right into the middle of our range so i feel like we re set up very well to deliver another year of solid growth in the data business the mix of that s going to look a little different the pricing and analytics business as i mentioned has moved up from 4 5 to over 5 to 6 5 and i think s headed to 7 this year connectivity on the other side capacity growth has been tremendous over the last couple of years i think that will likely slow a little bit this year as customers consume that capacity but again you re seeing that content coming through the additional capacity in pricing and analytics grow but connectivity itself is likely to be closer to a 1 to 2 growth and then exchange data is going to be in the middle of those two with our futures and exchange data continuing to be in strong demand some additional value capture from oil products that we were able to add to our energy packages and so overall i feel like 2019 sets up to be a very good year and i actually think the asv aligns perfectly with what the guidance suggests operator the next question will come from dan fannon of jefferies please go ahead dan fannon jefferies analyst thanks good morning one more question on the data just looking back at your the pie chart from the investor data broke down the kind of mid to high single digit growth and the components of that can you talk about the breakdown between pricing new customers incremental consumption kind of those the various buckets that you would outline and kind of how that fits today as you look at 19 where we re looking pretty much squarely at like a mid single digit number versus that mid to high scott hill chief financial officer yes thanks for the question so the interesting thing about that model is there are parts of the business where as you look at 19 expectation it fits perfectly there s a very good balance in the pricing and analytics business which i just said i think s going to go around 7 for the year new products your reference data products indices by the way ken the answer to your question is the bank of america merrill lynch indices are fully organic this year everything is because there weren t data acquisitions last year so all our growth in 19 will be organic but we ve got new products that are driving growth new customers the mifid two introduced us to a lot of small and medium sized european customers who are now buying the breadth of our products not just things like the liquidity indicator that solved an existing need existing customers buying more of those mifid two products that really drove great growth in europe that you ll look at the back of the flag and see that our mix to europe has actually moved back to 20 where it was 21 22 back when we had trade dipped below 20 now it s back those new customers buying more but then those new products existing customers in the u s are buying because they need liquidity indicators and best execution indicators and so that s driving growth and then again we are seeing a contribution from price i ll note one thing in that model if you pull it out it included roughly a point of growth from m a and we don t have that this year if you look back over the last couple of years and exclude the businesses we divested our inorganic growth if you will was close to 7 so i look at 2019 as a year where we re going to deliver very solid growth with the 10 element that relates to m a not present at all and then a very strong balance across pricing across new customers across new products et cetera in a fairly even contribution again inside pricing and analytics if you look at exchange data that really is our existing customers buying more on the future side and growth in the number of customers consuming those products and on the connectivity side even though i think it will slow versus where it was we continue to see capacity growth which again is existing customers buying more with in fact an actual price reduction there because as they buy the larger ports the actual price per gig comes down a little bit so it mixes across the elements but i think that revenue model is still very indicative other than again in 2019 we don t have the point contribution from m a operator the next question will come from alex blostein of goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning just a question around the i guess just thinking of the business so maybe get an update on initiatives you guys have lined up for 2019 and credit trading on the back of the platforms that you purchased i think on the last call maybe the call before that you talked about that being call it 100 ish million kind of trading annual run rate where does that stand today and what are some things you guys are working on to get that going higher jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer let me have ben jackson answer that for you ben jackson president analyst thanks alex so our platforms had a very strong q4 when you look at tmc and bondpoint as a lot of you know volatility came back to u s corporates and munis in the fourth quarter and we were a beneficiary of that where volume on bondpoint and tmc was up over 9 over the prior quarter and 20 over the prior year and in notional terms what was traded we were up 12 over the prior quarter and 50 over the prior year and note that i was highlighting there that notional is greater than volume which means the average trade size is also increasing on the platform so one of the things i ve talked about on prior calls is that odd lot trading so trades of north of 100 bonds per trade has continued to increase and last year we saw at bondpoint a 50 increase on an annual basis of odd lot trading and 23 increase on tmc the other thing i d highlight is you ve got to remember we ve owned these platforms for a short period of time so bondpoint we ve had for about a year tmc about six months and our integrated effort is well under way just in the last few weeks we ve combined our business and technology teams across tmc bondpoint creditex into one team now called ice bonds and we re executing with a single mission direction leveraging technology across the group for efficiencies and scales so we re starting to realize some of what i have mentioned on prior calls is getting the operating income of those businesses in line with where we see our other trading businesses the only thing i d say is you ve got to take a step back because buying those businesses wasn t about just fixed income execution and isolation it s really about providing our customers a complete integrated comprehensive solution to real challenges that there are in fixed income when you combine real time and end of day pricing we re the market leader providing for 3 million instruments around the world not only end of day prices but real time prices with our reference data business where we re providing reference data the golden record of the terms and conditions for bonds for 13 million instruments a leader in that space we have index expertise and fixed income that came onboard with the ice bank of america merrill lynch index business that s growing fast as mentioned in the commentary we also have analytics leadership in the fixed income space where customers trust us with 1 trillion in assets to run through our analytical platforms to understand the return attribution to identify the next optimal trade opportunity to identify liquidity risks that they have in their portfolio et cetera and last but not least you add onto that the choice of execution protocols that we have from central order book and streaming protocols that s core to the businesses that we bought and that s the most difficult protocols to establish when you have to manage 100 million price updates a day on bondpoint 77 million price updates on tmc you have securities that you can provide customers that on 10 000 securities you can provide markets that have 250 bonds up on the best bid and best offer at any given point in time we have 23 000 securities with two way markets you have to manage best execution manage connectivity manage latency all these are real challenges in building out those streaming protocols and we have that well established in our business in addition i ve highlighted that we re building out our cue and auction capabilities that already represents 20 of the volume on those platforms and will be instrumental as well when the etf hub project comes to life later this year that i ve also talked to this group about and the etf hub project gives us an opportunity to be at one of the hottest and highest growth area in the fixed income space which is passive investing which has had a 30 cagr over the last 10 years that gives you a little bit of a flavor of the initiatives that we have coming down the pipe operator the next question will come from michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks good morning scott just on the on some of the guidance on the expenses just in terms of like some of the buckets that you gave just anywhere like 30 million 35 million on tech investment for new growth and then the 20 million 25 million on bakkt just wanted to get your sense on like what are those maybe initiatives what are the expected returns or like revenue growth associated with some of those expenses whether it s a 19 or further out scott hill chief financial officer yes so it s a good question and hopefully you found the guidance pretty consistent with what we ve done in prior years and as i look at kind of the average expectations i think they re in terms of 2019 expense i think they re pretty consistent as well with two adjustments and i think right now you guys on average are expecting us to be around 21 60 55 or 60 we told you that we went to work on the businesses we acquired last year and i ve already taken out 15 million of costs there which if you would just use the run rate would be new news and then additionally as you point out we did note that we would be investing based on our first quarter run rate 20 million to 25 million and i said we d keep you updated on that as we move through the year specifically with regards to the revenue and the technology investments i think those will continue to support revenue growth that likely overall is going to be in kind of that mid single digit range in total that s all subject to volatility but i definitely think those investments just as they did in 17 and 18 will support continued revenue growth i think bakkt is really an investment and i ll hand it over to jeff to talk a little bit about it that s more about the future and revenue and market opportunities that we see in the future and less about 2019 top line jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer yes bakkt is a unique structure for us and that we ve actually set it up as a separate company with a separate name its own management team and separate capitalization so right now ice is the majority investor in the company i expect that we ll do other rounds of financing we ll make a decision as it goes forward whether we stay majority or allow it to spin three of us we believe that what ice has if you step back and look at us is we have obviously trading clearing we have settlement capabilities warehouse and custody management capabilities large treasury operations banking connectivity and a global infrastructure that is in many many jurisdictions regulatory distinctions around the world with a massive cyber overlay that infrastructure has attracted a lot of very very interesting companies that have come some that have invested in bakkt some are just working with bakkt to try to tap into that infrastructure for some new use cases that will involve blockchain and digital assets and other things that we can provide these people obviously we ve announced the our work with starbucks and microsoft we have very very large retail franchises global connectivity to end users that we hope will be brought into that ecosystem and could create a very very valuable company out of that initiative if our business plan plays out so it s a bit of a moonshot bet and it s been organized in a manner that is very different than the way ice typically does businesses bakkt has its own offices its own management team and et cetera and then we ve entered into agreements with it to provide services as i ve described over that bakkt over that ice overlay so we ll see how it goes they re well along in building out an infrastructure that i think you ll see launch later this year and i ll let bakkt talk more about how it wants to go about an what the business and use cases are its revenue model et cetera as it unfolds ben jackson president analyst yes and then the other only thing i d add is in addition to separate teams separate office it s separately funded we and our partners have put cash aside to fund this business and so while it won t generate revenue in the current year it also doesn t impact our leverage that s already funded it doesn t impact our capital returns we increased the dividend 15 we ve already bought back over 115 million of shares in the quarter and so it is funded in a sense even though it s incremental expense on top of what you would have anticipated it is funded by cash that we and our partners have already put aside operator the next question will come from kyle voigt of kbw please go ahead kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good morning just one on m a over the past few years more of the m a for ice has been targeted on deals that are more bolt on in nature so i guess my question s really on the large scale m a and the exchange space i think you ve previously cited uncertainty around brexit uncertainty more broadly about the regulatory environment as an impediment to that occurring in the future along with the political environment but it seems that we ve gotten some clarity at least on the brexit side for clearing like can you give us an update on whether you still see the regulatory environment and this uncertainty more broadly as an impediment to large scale m a in the sector jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer i think the sort of leading aspect to your question i think is correct is that things are clearing up from a regulatory standpoint from a market structure standpoint people have the large exchange groups have sort of stepped their footprints and it becomes more obvious where other acquisitions should flow in my mind in our industry we ve seen obviously the formation of large exchange groups like ice and our peers we ve also seen a consolidation in traders particularly high frequency trading has consolidated and we ve seen a consolidation in brokers order flow tends to go to a more limited number the mifid impact of providing analysis and analytics in your space has concentrated people so we ve been seeing a concentration across the entire financial services market that we serve you could sort of date in there as well a number of large data companies formed up so i do think that there will be continued m a in our space and maybe more obvious as to where these large companies will touch one another that said m a for us have to be disciplined we ve done a lot of m a that s been opportunistic large m a has been opportunistic when it s been obvious that we should get together with somebody that s set into our model that where we target returns above our cost of capital and make sure that these deals work with shareholders and as you know we ve been very disciplined on our synergy cases and we hold ourselves to high regard to deliver the synergies that we promised and so m a is not easy as companies get larger but all that said i do believe that some of the impediments are clearing ben jackson president analyst yes and just in the event you missed it on my first slide to validate jeff s point on the financial discipline that we ve executed on our past deals our return on invested capital is now back to 9 in total it s 300 basis points above our cost of capital and if you look at kind of outside idc it would ve been back at 10 and so when we say we re committed to doing deals that generate 10 returns you see it in the results on our overall return on invested capital which again as jeff said is that capital base has grown moving that made will continuously higher which we ve done requires us to continue to grow profit which we ve done operator the next question will come from ben herbert of citi please go ahead ben herbert citi analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the question just wanted to go back to the data and particularly pricing and analytics just within fixed income how do you feel positioned to continue to accelerate growth there i mean could we see more of that as you further integrate the ecosystem you ve built or i know you gave the m a guidance for 19 but i mean is there an opportunity do you think to be a bit more acquisitive in the fixed income side ben jackson president analyst ben it s ben i think one of the place i d start with is some of the commentary that i ve mentioned before in that our strategy when we ve looked at fixed income is we took a different approach to it than many others where we looked at what is the comprehensive solution that people need to solve the real issues in fixed income issues like how do i get a fair price how do i figure out for someone that doesn t trade all that often what is the price of that instrument how do i keep on top of all of the vast ocean of reference data i need to understand in trading that how do i find people that when i identify a trade i want to do how do i find somebody that has inventory that indeed wants to trade and then on the execution side being able to offer a number of different protocols for someone to execute the thing i d highlight that really pulled that i think is a good sign that we re heading down the right path year is that etf hub project that i mentioned because it really in order to deliver that you have to have all those pieces and we re uniquely positioned to do that and when you think about it for the first time later this year when we launch the etf hub again one of the hottest areas of growth in the fixed income market for the first time if you re an authorized participant or a market maker and you want to create or redeem a share of an etf you re going to be able to for the first time connect to a single portal and in that single portal you ll be able to connect to multiple issuers as opposed to having 12 different interfaces that you re dealing with to interface with these with the issuers second you ll be able to gather the index constituents for each issuer s etfs so think of all the hundreds of etfs that they have multiply it by the number of issuers that s all going to be able to be done in a single portal third you ll be able to view that days basket constituents to be able to create or redeem a share every day those constituents change for each one of those funds and each one of those issuers so you can see the problem compounds on itself as you think about it and the way that things are done today fourth you ll be able to gather market data data from us that we re the leading price provider in the space to be able to understand what are the trading levels of the constituents and the baskets that could be created or redeemed in that day next you ll be able to negotiate what is acceptable to submit through a create or redeem in order to do that you have to have instant messaging capabilities which we have a well established instant messaging capabilities to be able to underpin this and last but not least you ll be able to execute via our streaming protocols our rfq our auctions as well as third party venues to choose to connect through this portal to me that s a pretty powerful sign of a place in the market that s growing very fast where market participants are pulling us into it because they see us uniquely positioned with the combination of assets that we have to solve this problem and to help the passive investing fixed income space go to that next level of growth operator the next question will come from brian bedell of deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell deutsche bank analyst thanks very much just scott on the data revenue guidance on the constant currency basis from 4 to 6 what do you see as the biggest drivers between the difference of the 4 to 6 is it mostly in pricing or actually new customers and then if i could just ask one a couple of timing questions just on ben i think you said launching the rfq and etf hub later this year when you think that might start contributing from a revenue perspective if that s later this year or 2020 and then just one on timing of nymex development jeff that thanks for your answer prior on that do you think that is the members exchange is something that actually gets up and running and can begin to affect the markets later this year or is that more of a 2020 type of event scott hill chief financial officer yes so i ll start i think there were 3 questions embedded in there the 4 to 6 look i went into last year and i gave you guys a fairly tight data guidance and said we have good visibility into it which i still believe is the case but i think that got interpreted to something like 99 5 certainty in february and so the range is a little wider this year just acknowledging what happened in 18 there were some places where we had some erosion that we didn t expect on the downside in the desktop business some audits that we didn t anticipate in certain quarters as we move through the year and so the reality is that all of those things worked out to a year where we grew the business 5 and as i mentioned asv revenues actually grew 6 but there were some churn that ran through the stock because the 2 million or 3 million difference in any given quarter and a 15 million or 20 million difference on 2 billion of revenue for the year and so i thought it was prudent to try and take some of the volatility out around people who are trying to guess that 1 million on 500 million in the quarter as i said on the call i feel very confident that if you look at the asv number that s going to point you right to the middle of our range and then inside that it s going to be driven by growth in pricing and analytics so ben s laid out a very compelling case for our overall fixed income investment but that s a bit that is effectively the idc business that used to grow 2 to 3 and i m telling you it s going to grow 2 5 times faster than that just a few years later and the asv supports that and there s a lot of momentum in the products that we ve got so i feel very good about the business i think the only thing you should interpret in the widening of the range is just a little bit more hey yes it could be plus or minus 1 versus plus or minus 0 5 last year jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer and brian i ll pick up on the rfq etf hub questions that you had so on rfq we have that capability now so in your question you said is that going to be coming later this year you have to remember from being a longtime exchange and clearinghouse market operator in a number of different asset classes we have expertise in the rfq auction space in many of our markets so we leverage a lot of that expertise and we re able to get those rfq capabilities established on both bondpoint and tmc very rapidly so that capability and functionality is there now and now it s about leveraging our network and our distribution capabilities to get that out which we re very well able to do as we have brought those businesses together with our creditex business that i ve mentioned and also leveraging all of the touch points we have in the fixed income community through our ice data services business for the etf hub that will launch later this year that s our targeted time frame with our steering committee we have completed the requirements definition around that we have the design well under way we have a lot of the most of the major issuers that are onboard helping us with this as well as the major aps and market makers that are helping and assisting with that design and that has enabled us to really lock that down and now we re looking at later this year so you ll see contribution on those we re targeting 2020 and lastly on the members exchange i guess i m not aware that there s management or anybody working on anything but that s really not their obligation to discuss it with us but that said if i was in their position if i wanted to get the market fast i d probably just copy verbatim somebody else s rule book and probably there s a one year ish process one maybe two of course if i copy somebody else s rule book it doesn t give you anything that s unique that exists and i would suspect that there s going to be a lot of scrutiny around the very issue that many pondents are talking about which is are the members going to try to buy us their business toward the exchange rather than seek the best price for their customers in the marketplace and that come along way in the last few years in terms of disclosure and nobility of that behavior but it s not completely done yet so i suspect there ll be a fair amount of conversation and review of just how is order flow intended to be routed with all that said nothing moves fast in the regulatory world and i can tell you that i m watching bakkt try to stand up its regulatory footprint and things are not moving necessarily fast right now in the united states operator the last question for today will come from chris allen of compass point please go ahead chris allen compass point analyst good morning guys i think most of my questions have gone answered i just had a quick numbers question just on the other revenues which are boosted by 5 million in fines in 3q up sequentially again in 4q i m just kind of wondering what s been driving that over the course of the year and kind of the outlook there scott hill chief financial officer so the other revenue chris is where we ve got the revenues associated actually with the interest we earned on our clearinghouse deposit and so as the fed has moved rates up and the balances have grown and they tend to grow at year end people like to part cash at our clearinghouses at year end that s what drove it up and so depending on what the rate environment is as we move through 19 you could see a similar dynamic if rates were constant it will all correlate to the actual levels of collateral cash collateral specifically that to some that s held at our clearinghouse nothing more than that operator this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to jeff sprecher for any closing remarks jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you kerry thank you all for joining us on the call and we look forward to really a guided up year again for 2019 and we ll talk to you in the next quarter operator duration 62 minutes call participants warren gardiner vice president of investor relations scott

regarding the definition of certain items also with us on the call today are jeff sprecher chairman and ceo scott hill chief financial officer and ben jackson our president i ll now turn the call over to scott scott hill chief financial officer thanks warren good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i ll begin on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our record fourth quarter performance ice s consolidated fourth quarter net revenues increased 14 year over year to a record 1 3 billion advertisement advertisement trading and clearing net revenues were a record 657 million and data and listings revenues totaled a record 651 million underpinned by organic constant currency growth of 6 adjusted operating expenses totaled 553 million in the quarter our fourth quarter expenses included a 5 million increase in our performance related compensation reflecting the strong end to a good year in addition the quarter included around 3 million related to organizational restructuring and a few million dollars of nonrecurring items these items weren t contemplated in our original guidance and aren t expected to be recurring continuing with our fourth quarter highlights adjusted operating income grew 14 year over year and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of 0 94 a 25 increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017 importantly that strong earnings growth combined with reduced capex spend generated record free cash flow of 2 3 billion up 32 versus the prior year i ll discuss the way we put that cash to work on slide 5 during the fourth quarter we deployed the remaining 140 million of our 2018 1 2 billion repurchase authorization when combined with the 555 million in dividends we paid the capital return to shareholders during 2018 totaled nearly 1 8 billion that record capital return is 23 higher than last year and nearly double what we returned just a few years ago we did all of this while maintaining our target leverage and investing over 1 billion in strategic initiatives including fixed income mortgages and along with our partners the launch of bakkt the strong cash generation of our business model will continue to support our disciplined approach to investment and capital return once again in 2019 as we ve indicated in the past we re committed to growing our dividend as the company grows reflecting that commitment our board authorized a 15 increase in our quarterly dividend to 0 275 per share advertisement advertisement and as we noted on our third quarter call our board has approved a 2 billion share repurchase authorization from which we ve already deployed around 115 million in january now let s move to slide 6 where i ll provide an overview of the fourth quarter performance of our trading and clearing business trading and clearing revenue which increased 14 for the full year grew to 657 million in the fourth quarter with both energy and ag revenue up 13 and financials revenue up 28 fourth quarter adv and our futures business increased 21 year over year as energy ag rate and equity index products all increased versus the prior year while january volumes across our futures and option complex are down year over year they re up sequentially versus an unusually strong december and importantly open interest continues to build with oi at the end of january 4 higher than a year ago led by continued strength in oil and interest rate products at the nyse transaction revenues increased 35 year over year driven by higher industry volumes and market share gains across cash equity and options as well as the acquisition of chx adv in our cash equity s business increased 45 year over year in the fourth quarter and average daily volume in our options business was up 44 this momentum carried into january with cash equity volumes up 19 year over year moving to fixed income and credit which includes cds clearing our fixed income trading businesses and ice mortgage services revenue totaled 83 million for the quarter cds clearing revenue increased 25 year over year and is growing at a compound growth rate of 15 since 2012 new participants new products and the need for additional credit protection remain catalyst for that business turning next to slide 7 i ll discuss the data and listings segment fourth quarter data services revenue grew 6 on an organic constant currency basis to a record 539 million for the full year data services revenues grew 5 on an organic constant currency basis including 6 growth in products included in our asv which account for roughly 90 of our data services business within data services during the fourth quarter revenue from an exchange data and feeds grew 7 and desktops and connectivity grew 1 each on an organic constant currency basis advertisement advertisement please note that beginning with the fourth quarter we have moved our feeds business out of desktops and connectivity and into exchange data this better distinguishes the exchange related content we sell from our distribution capabilities and it provides a better comparison to our data services peers we ve provided a restatement of historical data services results to reflect this change in the appendix revenues from pricing and analytics which represent half of our data revenues and nearly a quarter of our total revenues were up 7 on an organic constant currency basis for the third consecutive quarter as you can see on the slide our pricing and analytics revenue growth has accelerated from nearly 4 5 in 2016 to more than 5 in 2017 and now to over 6 5 in 2018 this accelerating growth reflects contributions from every component of our revenue model new customers new products increased consumption from existing customers and targeted price increases and importantly asv for pricing and analytics entering 2019 is up 7 giving us confidence and continued momentum finally in our listings business revenues grew 8 in the fourth quarter and the nyse listed 16 ipos despite heightened market volatility and for the year we were once again the leading u s exchange in terms of capital formation helping our customers raise 30 billion in ipo proceeds i ll conclude my remarks on slide 8 on the left hand side of the slide you can see a recap of our strong 2018 performance revenues grew 7 adjusted operating income grew 8 adjusted earnings per share grew 21 and free cash flow grew 32 on the right hand side of the slide you ll note a few points of guidance for 2019 we expect full year data services revenues to be between 2 19 billion and 2 24 billion this includes 540 million to 545 million in the first quarter with sequential improvement each quarter thereafter advertisement advertisement this also reflects the impact of a stronger dollar versus both the euro and pound which is currently expected to reduce 2019 data revenues by roughly 5 million to 10 million and of note with no material data acquisitions in 2018 currency fluctuations is the only adjustment that should be required to calculate our 2019 data revenue growth moving next to expenses we anticipate full year adjusted operating expense to be between 2 15 billion and 2 2 billion 2018 acquisitions in our trading and clearing segment will generate roughly 35 million to 40 million in incremental expense net of around 15 million in actions already taken to reduce the costs of those acquired businesses in addition to the cost savings the expense will be more than offset by over 100 million of incremental revenue on top of the cost savings for the recently acquired businesses we will deliver the final 30 million of synergies related to idc which means we will have achieved our original commitment of 180 million in total synergies next consistent with past years we will once again reward our employees for their strong contribution as a part of our pay for performance philosophy which will increase compensation expense by 35 million to 40 million investments in technology as well as expenses tied to revenue growth will add around 30 million to 35 million and finally our investment in bakkt will generate 20 million to 25 million of expense based upon the run rate in the first quarter we will update you on progress at bakkt and the level of investment as we move through the year we delivered another record year in 2018 and we have momentum entering 2019 i ll be happy to take your questions during q a but for now i ll hand it to jeff to expand on our strategic plans entering the new year advertisement advertisement jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott and good morning to everyone on the call let me begin on slide 9 we re pleased to report what was the best year in ice s history and that marks our 13th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share our track record of growth is a testament to the strategic approach that we ve taken since our inception to build a globally diverse platform that enhances our customers workflows using technology to bring efficiency transparency and reliability to markets in our futures markets we re strategically positioned in major market centers around the world with six simple clearinghouses across north america the u k europe and asia it s a footprint that gives our customers choice helps insulate us from regulatory and political risk and provides a platform for product development that enables us to swiftly capitalize on growth opportunities as they emerge around the world our exchanges and clearinghouses operate on common technology providing our markets with the flexibility to move jurisdictions if desired often as quickly as over a weekend these markets run on proprietary technology designed to meet the comprehensive workflow need of a wide range of market participants on top of this technology and our global distribution are the critical benchmark contracts that traders investors and commercial participants rely upon to manage their everyday risks in our oil markets brent crude is the global benchmark for nearly two thirds of the internationally traded oil that moves around the world each day once again brent generated record revenues in 2018 and it remains a cornerstone of our energy product development as well as for customer acquisition and retention in our energy business brent s relevance to our oil complex is complimented by our gasoil contract advertisement advertisement gasoil s been one of the fastest growing energy benchmarks with open interest up 11 per annum on average over the last five years gasoil has become a key benchmark for the refined barrel including diesel and jet fuel and the upcoming imo marine fuel regulations which are set to take hold in 2020 could provide additional risk management tailwinds to our oil complex in our natural gas markets we offer a suite of liquid global benchmarks a platform that is unmatched in the marketplace in fact roughly two thirds of our natural gas revenue is now derived from products other than the u s henry hub a benchmark that is losing relevance to commercial customers as other global benchmarks grow as natural gas globalizes our customers participation in these markets have accelerated with open interest across our 58 north american natural gas spaces markets up 17 year over year our european ttf natural gas contract with open interest at near record levels up 64 year over year and with our jkm contract which is the benchmark for asian natural gas achieving record trading volumes in january we see a similar dynamic in our financial futures business which includes european interest rates and equity indices brexit uncertainty and the shifting expectations around global economic growth continue to drive increased hedging activities with interest rate average daily volumes increasing 14 year over year and open interest up 8 through the end of january and our alternative interest rate complex is also benefiting from increased adoption with over 1 6 trillion of notional cleared in our sonia products since its launch just over a year ago in our equities futures business average daily volume in our msci index has grown at a cagr of 34 since 2014 and was up 40 in january in particular as trade tensions in the u s and china continue to build so too is open interest in the msci emerging market index as of the end of january open interest stood at 1 4 million contracts and for comparison purposes this represents over 20 of the total notional outstanding in the s p 500 e mini contract an amount which was less than 5 only five years ago in addition to our futures markets we re continuously working to bring efficiencies transparency and reliability to the u s advertisement advertisement cash equities markets at the nyse we ve been rolling out our pillar technology a technology that has the capacity to handle 80 billion messages a day and which should improve the customer execution and access experience to our seven distinct equities trading venues when combined with our hybrid designated market maker model we provide customers with a differentiated platform that reduces volatility provides tighter bid offer spreads and offers an all in cost to trade that is significantly lower than the average dark pool or dark venue like the iex exchange our model of compensating designated market makers to protect and manage stocks is a unique value proposition that shines brightest amid market volatility such as we ve seen in december as the average quoted spreads on nyse listed and traded stocks were approximately 100 excuse me 180 basis points tighter and volatility was over 50 lower on the open and 60 lower on the close than our closest listing competitor and finally in our data services business we continue to build on our unique platform as the leading provider of mission critical derived data and analytics the results of these efforts are best illustrated by the performance in our pricing and analytics business which grew nearly 7 in 2018 demand for our pricing and reference data analytics and indices is accelerating active managers continue to search for better tools and data to drive output as there s a shift toward passive investing which continues these two trends have provided a tailwind to our business in particular to our index business at the end of january following the transition of the ishares preferred stock etf ice had 175 billion of fixed income etf assets tracking our indices a whopping 80 increase from just a year ago turning to slide 10 as i noted at the beginning of my prepared remarks 2018 was yet another record year for ice a strong top line contribution from our transaction business was complemented by compounding growth in our data and listings business coupled with strong expense management and our synergy execution we produced double digit eps growth reinforcing our conviction that we have in our long term strategy and as we look to 2019 and beyond we re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead not only for our core business but also for newer initiatives such as ice mortgage services our fixed income businesses and bakkt which recently raised over 180 million in its first round of funding i d like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2018 and i want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to yet another very strong year for ice i ll now turn the call back to our operator kerry and she ll conduct the question and answer session until 9 30 eastern time operator the first question will come from rich repetto of sandler o neill please go ahead rich repetto sandler o neill analyst good morning jeff good morning scott i guess my question s going to be a broad question on some of the external sort of forces you re bumping into both in europe and the u s and i guess in europe when you look at brexit jeff you mentioned some of the benefits that people are needing to hedge more but could you overall give us a recap of where do you think you stand on brexit there s this issue of i know the tax on commodities potentially being forced by the eu and then in the u s the external forces where these ideas of compete new competing exchange as well as the scrutiny on data do you think that that we can move on beyond that or what points would you highlight to investors in those areas jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer well welcome to my world rich you basically asked me to describe my job so let s start with brexit first of all as you ve mentioned unfortunately we benefit from brexit because the volatility that government actions impose on companies force them to manage their risk and we re in the risk management business so there s really an overarching positive impact on our revenues and income that said as you know we ve long felt that we shouldn t consolidate all our businesses geographically and we have a trading and clearing operation in the u k and we also have a trading and clearing operation in the eu and we put both of them on common technologies so that we have to move business around it s really just a database move inside of our company and not a physical move and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks that s something we can do over a weekend that said there s a lot of political back and forth going on including now revisiting tax issues on the tax issues specifically this has been going on for over a decade it s remanded to the courts now the eu courts in 21 months or so the u k theoretically is no longer bound by the eu courts so i don t know that it s going this is going to have any practical impact other than another negotiating ploy that s going on over a complicated relationship between the u k and the eu as it relates to brexit it s something that we everybody and our whole industry has lived with forever but ice has always maintained the optionality to move contracts and to locate business where our customers want to be and if certain things would have to move or be relocated in order to map and minimize the impact of that we certainly would do that we ll take our cue from the industry with respect to the u s and the members exchange let me just set the table if i could because for some reason there seems to be an incredible amount of concern about this press release you have to go back to a decade or so when we ve had the automation of trading particularly in the equities world we had the flash boys book in the flash boys phenomenon and as a result of that we saw the sec a couple of years ago order the exchanges to do what they called a tick pilot which was essentially widen out or narrow the spreads of certain stocks to see how they would trade and really what that is doing is affecting the behavior of the high frequency traders that make their income by trying to capture the bid offer spread that pilot has finished and the data s being analyzed and you next see the sec trying to promulgate something called a fee pilot it s not that well named in my mind because it actually doesn t impact the fees or the capture rate of the exchanges but it changes theoretically over a number of different buckets the amount of rebate that can be paid to high frequency market making firms and brokers there are a lot of people in our industry that are looking at the retail equity market and saying the next leg of that stool if one follows the sec s actions maybe to investigate and change the way retail chain for order flow operates and which i think you know that retail order flow that comes through retail brokers is largely sold directly to high frequency market makers it never goes to exchanges and what we saw is a group of high frequency market makers that participate in the retail space organized up all of the retail brokers that they pay these fees to and try to quickly move to set up an exchange that we believe is to try to get in front of what may be the trend of eliminating and changing their business model now for us at the new york stock exchange unfortunately we don t see any of that retail order flow we don t believe that that the behavior impacts us at all in fact to the extent that those orders are not executed on after they re sold to the market makers the exhaust which are basically people consider to be toxic because these are bids and offers that are off market are routed to an exchange that is not us so we have very little impact with what s going on over there that said we believe that we support what they re doing and we ll not fight to what they re doing because we think it has still benefits to the new york stock exchange first of all we don t compete for any retail order flow and if the idea is that they re no longer going to be able to sell order flow directly to market makers and it s going to have to be public competition to the retail consumers for the best bid offer we would like to compete for that and if there s going to be a new exchange they think they can compete for we believe we could compete for we have among the lowest cost of trading all in cost of trading anywhere cheaper than dark pools cheaper than the newer exchanges that have formed up and we believe that the new exchange is going to have to cover its cost for us it s where we ll be incremental and we believe we could offer low cost trading that would be accretive to ice shareholders and very very competitive to the end user for the bid offer secondly a new exchange is going to continue to fragment order flow even if there are even if there s no business there bids and offers that are sent there are going to have to be viewed that s going to increase the capacity the network capacity needed to manage that that means the data spend wallet of end users is going to go up not down and we run networks and we can compete to provide that increased capacity that s in fact a big part of the growth of this business so we see the wallet going up and lastly one of the techniques that the sec uses to promulgate these changes is to essentially order the exchanges to adopt rules instead of going through a large public rule making where which takes a long time and have a lot of comments and difficulty getting through oftentimes the sec will just order the exchanges to adopt the rule given that we have rule making capability so this is the case for example in a consolidated audit trail the exchanges were ordered to build a consolidated audit trail by filing individual rules at each exchange that would allow that to happen there s a lot of complaints in the market over who got the vote on that consolidated audit trail for example people that were not exchanges didn t get a vote now we know the reason that the buy side and the sell side would like to have a vote is they want to make sure that they don t have to pay for it or that they can at least cap the costs in the consolidated audit trail case there is no budget it is an unlimited spend it is one of the most technically difficult projects that has ever been attempted in our industry managing billions and billions of data point that have consumer information that can be captured time stamped on an atomic clock and can be readily searchable for trends is a daunting challenge and it has been a huge spend on behalf of the exchanges so we would welcome others to come in and help to fray those costs and have a vote in that matter because they also would be pregnant with the obligations of that matter the recent exchanges have been fighting people having votes is that they don t have the underlying obligation so long story short we see that we may have an opportunity to compete for retail order flow we believe there s going to be an increase data wallet spend and we believe that this could finally align interest in the industry and so in that regard i don t see why in any event anyone should consider it a negative impact on our company i think it will ultimately accrue positive thank you for listening to that one winded answer but that is my role questions and answers operator the next question will come from ken worthington of jpmorgan please go ahead ken worthington j p morgan analyst hi good morning on the data side your asv is up 6 your revenue guide for 2019 is up 3 5 to a little under 6 can you help us bridge the gap between the two clearly fx is a part but i think some of the inflation scott gave show that it was really a small part so what are the other factors in the gap between asv and the data revenue guide and is baml where is baml in these figures now on the organic side and where is it not scott hill chief financial officer so ken first of all the guidance range we gave constant currency is roughly 4 to 6 year over year so just to take any concerns or questions out regarding what a constant currency guide is in those dollar terms if you think about asv at 6 if you remember that s 90 of our revenue as i said in my prepared remarks in 2018 our overall data business grew 5 our asv revenue grew 6 and so the elements that aren t inside asv things like nms session fees et cetera haven t been and we don t expect will become big growth drivers in the overall business so i actually think if you take the absolute value asv and you consider it as 90 of our revenue it gives you it pushes you right into the middle of our range so i feel like we re set up very well to deliver another year of solid growth in the data business the mix of that s going to look a little different the pricing and analytics business as i mentioned has moved up from 4 5 to over 5 to 6 5 and i think s headed to 7 this year connectivity on the other side capacity growth has been tremendous over the last couple of years i think that will likely slow a little bit this year as customers consume that capacity but again you re seeing that content coming through the additional capacity in pricing and analytics grow but connectivity itself is likely to be closer to a 1 to 2 growth and then exchange data is going to be in the middle of those two with our futures and exchange data continuing to be in strong demand some additional value capture from oil products that we were able to add to our energy packages and so overall i feel like 2019 sets up to be a very good year and i actually think the asv aligns perfectly with what the guidance suggests operator the next question will come from dan fannon of jefferies please go ahead dan fannon jefferies analyst thanks good morning one more question on the data just looking back at your the pie chart from the investor data broke down the kind of mid to high single digit growth and the components of that can you talk about the breakdown between pricing new customers incremental consumption kind of those the various buckets that you would outline and kind of how that fits today as you look at 19 where we re looking pretty much squarely at like a mid single digit number versus that mid to high scott hill chief financial officer yes thanks for the question so the interesting thing about that model is there are parts of the business where as you look at 19 expectation it fits perfectly there s a very good balance in the pricing and analytics business which i just said i think s going to go around 7 for the year new products your reference data products indices by the way ken the answer to your question is the bank of america merrill lynch indices are fully organic this year everything is because there weren t data acquisitions last year so all our growth in 19 will be organic but we ve got new products that are driving growth new customers the mifid two introduced us to a lot of small and medium sized european customers who are now buying the breadth of our products not just things like the liquidity indicator that solved an existing need existing customers buying more of those mifid two products that really drove great growth in europe that you ll look at the back of the flag and see that our mix to europe has actually moved back to 20 where it was 21 22 back when we had trade dipped below 20 now it s back those new customers buying more but then those new products existing customers in the u s are buying because they need liquidity indicators and best execution indicators and so that s driving growth and then again we are seeing a contribution from price i ll note one thing in that model if you pull it out it included roughly a point of growth from m a and we don t have that this year if you look back over the last couple of years and exclude the businesses we divested our inorganic growth if you will was close to 7 so i look at 2019 as a year where we re going to deliver very solid growth with the 10 element that relates to m a not present at all and then a very strong balance across pricing across new customers across new products et cetera in a fairly even contribution again inside pricing and analytics if you look at exchange data that really is our existing customers buying more on the future side and growth in the number of customers consuming those products and on the connectivity side even though i think it will slow versus where it was we continue to see capacity growth which again is existing customers buying more with in fact an actual price reduction there because as they buy the larger ports the actual price per gig comes down a little bit so it mixes across the elements but i think that revenue model is still very indicative other than again in 2019 we don t have the point contribution from m a operator the next question will come from alex blostein of goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning just a question around the i guess just thinking of the business so maybe get an update on initiatives you guys have lined up for 2019 and credit trading on the back of the platforms that you purchased i think on the last call maybe the call before that you talked about that being call it 100 ish million kind of trading annual run rate where does that stand today and what are some things you guys are working on to get that going higher jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer let me have ben jackson answer that for you ben jackson president analyst thanks alex so our platforms had a very strong q4 when you look at tmc and bondpoint as a lot of you know volatility came back to u s corporates and munis in the fourth quarter and we were a beneficiary of that where volume on bondpoint and tmc was up over 9 over the prior quarter and 20 over the prior year and in notional terms what was traded we were up 12 over the prior quarter and 50 over the prior year and note that i was highlighting there that notional is greater than volume which means the average trade size is also increasing on the platform so one of the things i ve talked about on prior calls is that odd lot trading so trades of north of 100 bonds per trade has continued to increase and last year we saw at bondpoint a 50 increase on an annual basis of odd lot trading and 23 increase on tmc the other thing i d highlight is you ve got to remember we ve owned these platforms for a short period of time so bondpoint we ve had for about a year tmc about six months and our integrated effort is well under way just in the last few weeks we ve combined our business and technology teams across tmc bondpoint creditex into one team now called ice bonds and we re executing with a single mission direction leveraging technology across the group for efficiencies and scales so we re starting to realize some of what i have mentioned on prior calls is getting the operating income of those businesses in line with where we see our other trading businesses the only thing i d say is you ve got to take a step back because buying those businesses wasn t about just fixed income execution and isolation it s really about providing our customers a complete integrated comprehensive solution to real challenges that there are in fixed income when you combine real time and end of day pricing we re the market leader providing for 3 million instruments around the world not only end of day prices but real time prices with our reference data business where we re providing reference data the golden record of the terms and conditions for bonds for 13 million instruments a leader in that space we have index expertise and fixed income that came onboard with the ice bank of america merrill lynch index business that s growing fast as mentioned in the commentary we also have analytics leadership in the fixed income space where customers trust us with 1 trillion in assets to run through our analytical platforms to understand the return attribution to identify the next optimal trade opportunity to identify liquidity risks that they have in their portfolio et cetera and last but not least you add onto that the choice of execution protocols that we have from central order book and streaming protocols that s core to the businesses that we bought and that s the most difficult protocols to establish when you have to manage 100 million price updates a day on bondpoint 77 million price updates on tmc you have securities that you can provide customers that on 10 000 securities you can provide markets that have 250 bonds up on the best bid and best offer at any given point in time we have 23 000 securities with two way markets you have to manage best execution manage connectivity manage latency all these are real challenges in building out those streaming protocols and we have that well established in our business in addition i ve highlighted that we re building out our cue and auction capabilities that already represents 20 of the volume on those platforms and will be instrumental as well when the etf hub project comes to life later this year that i ve also talked to this group about and the etf hub project gives us an opportunity to be at one of the hottest and highest growth area in the fixed income space which is passive investing which has had a 30 cagr over the last 10 years that gives you a little bit of a flavor of the initiatives that we have coming down the pipe operator the next question will come from michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks good morning scott just on the on some of the guidance on the expenses just in terms of like some of the buckets that you gave just anywhere like 30 million 35 million on tech investment for new growth and then the 20 million 25 million on bakkt just wanted to get your sense on like what are those maybe initiatives what are the expected returns or like revenue growth associated with some of those expenses whether it s a 19 or further out scott hill chief financial officer yes so it s a good question and hopefully you found the guidance pretty consistent with what we ve done in prior years and as i look at kind of the average expectations i think they re in terms of 2019 expense i think they re pretty consistent as well with two adjustments and i think right now you guys on average are expecting us to be around 21 60 55 or 60 we told you that we went to work on the businesses we acquired last year and i ve already taken out 15 million of costs there which if you would just use the run rate would be new news and then additionally as you point out we did note that we would be investing based on our first quarter run rate 20 million to 25 million and i said we d keep you updated on that as we move through the year specifically with regards to the revenue and the technology investments i think those will continue to support revenue growth that likely overall is going to be in kind of that mid single digit range in total that s all subject to volatility but i definitely think those investments just as they did in 17 and 18 will support continued revenue growth i think bakkt is really an investment and i ll hand it over to jeff to talk a little bit about it that s more about the future and revenue and market opportunities that we see in the future and less about 2019 top line jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer yes bakkt is a unique structure for us and that we ve actually set it up as a separate company with a separate name its own management team and separate capitalization so right now ice is the majority investor in the company i expect that we ll do other rounds of financing we ll make a decision as it goes forward whether we stay majority or allow it to spin three of us we believe that what ice has if you step back and look at us is we have obviously trading clearing we have settlement capabilities warehouse and custody management capabilities large treasury operations banking connectivity and a global infrastructure that is in many many jurisdictions regulatory distinctions around the world with a massive cyber overlay that infrastructure has attracted a lot of very very interesting companies that have come some that have invested in bakkt some are just working with bakkt to try to tap into that infrastructure for some new use cases that will involve blockchain and digital assets and other things that we can provide these people obviously we ve announced the our work with starbucks and microsoft we have very very large retail franchises global connectivity to end users that we hope will be brought into that ecosystem and could create a very very valuable company out of that initiative if our business plan plays out so it s a bit of a moonshot bet and it s been organized in a manner that is very different than the way ice typically does businesses bakkt has its own offices its own management team and et cetera and then we ve entered into agreements with it to provide services as i ve described over that bakkt over that ice overlay so we ll see how it goes they re well along in building out an infrastructure that i think you ll see launch later this year and i ll let bakkt talk more about how it wants to go about an what the business and use cases are its revenue model et cetera as it unfolds ben jackson president analyst yes and then the other only thing i d add is in addition to separate teams separate office it s separately funded we and our partners have put cash aside to fund this business and so while it won t generate revenue in the current year it also doesn t impact our leverage that s already funded it doesn t impact our capital returns we increased the dividend 15 we ve already bought back over 115 million of shares in the quarter and so it is funded in a sense even though it s incremental expense on top of what you would have anticipated it is funded by cash that we and our partners have already put aside operator the next question will come from kyle voigt of kbw please go ahead kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good morning just one on m a over the past few years more of the m a for ice has been targeted on deals that are more bolt on in nature so i guess my question s really on the large scale m a and the exchange space i think you ve previously cited uncertainty around brexit uncertainty more broadly about the regulatory environment as an impediment to that occurring in the future along with the political environment but it seems that we ve gotten some clarity at least on the brexit side for clearing like can you give us an update on whether you still see the regulatory environment and this uncertainty more broadly as an impediment to large scale m a in the sector jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer i think the sort of leading aspect to your question i think is correct is that things are clearing up from a regulatory standpoint from a market structure standpoint people have the large exchange groups have sort of stepped their footprints and it becomes more obvious where other acquisitions should flow in my mind in our industry we ve seen obviously the formation of large exchange groups like ice and our peers we ve also seen a consolidation in traders particularly high frequency trading has consolidated and we ve seen a consolidation in brokers order flow tends to go to a more limited number the mifid impact of providing analysis and analytics in your space has concentrated people so we ve been seeing a concentration across the entire financial services market that we serve you could sort of date in there as well a number of large data companies formed up so i do think that there will be continued m a in our space and maybe more obvious as to where these large companies will touch one another that said m a for us have to be disciplined we ve done a lot of m a that s been opportunistic large m a has been opportunistic when it s been obvious that we should get together with somebody that s set into our model that where we target returns above our cost of capital and make sure that these deals work with shareholders and as you know we ve been very disciplined on our synergy cases and we hold ourselves to high regard to deliver the synergies that we promised and so m a is not easy as companies get larger but all that said i do believe that some of the impediments are clearing ben jackson president analyst yes and just in the event you missed it on my first slide to validate jeff s point on the financial discipline that we ve executed on our past deals our return on invested capital is now back to 9 in total it s 300 basis points above our cost of capital and if you look at kind of outside idc it would ve been back at 10 and so when we say we re committed to doing deals that generate 10 returns you see it in the results on our overall return on invested capital which again as jeff said is that capital base has grown moving that made will continuously higher which we ve done requires us to continue to grow profit which we ve done operator the next question will come from ben herbert of citi please go ahead ben herbert citi analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the question just wanted to go back to the data and particularly pricing and analytics just within fixed income how do you feel positioned to continue to accelerate growth there i mean could we see more of that as you further integrate the ecosystem you ve built or i know you gave the m a guidance for 19 but i mean is there an opportunity do you think to be a bit more acquisitive in the fixed income side ben jackson president analyst ben it s ben i think one of the place i d start with is some of the commentary that i ve mentioned before in that our strategy when we ve looked at fixed income is we took a different approach to it than many others where we looked at what is the comprehensive solution that people need to solve the real issues in fixed income issues like how do i get a fair price how do i figure out for someone that doesn t trade all that often what is the price of that instrument how do i keep on top of all of the vast ocean of reference data i need to understand in trading that how do i find people that when i identify a trade i want to do how do i find somebody that has inventory that indeed wants to trade and then on the execution side being able to offer a number of different protocols for someone to execute the thing i d highlight that really pulled that i think is a good sign that we re heading down the right path year is that etf hub project that i mentioned because it really in order to deliver that you have to have all those pieces and we re uniquely positioned to do that and when you think about it for the first time later this year when we launch the etf hub again one of the hottest areas of growth in the fixed income market for the first time if you re an authorized participant or a market maker and you want to create or redeem a share of an etf you re going to be able to for the first time connect to a single portal and in that single portal you ll be able to connect to multiple issuers as opposed to having 12 different interfaces that you re dealing with to interface with these with the issuers second you ll be able to gather the index constituents for each issuer s etfs so think of all the hundreds of etfs that they have multiply it by the number of issuers that s all going to be able to be done in a single portal third you ll be able to view that days basket constituents to be able to create or redeem a share every day those constituents change for each one of those funds and each one of those issuers so you can see the problem compounds on itself as you think about it and the way that things are done today fourth you ll be able to gather market data data from us that we re the leading price provider in the space to be able to understand what are the trading levels of the constituents and the baskets that could be created or redeemed in that day next you ll be able to negotiate what is acceptable to submit through a create or redeem in order to do that you have to have instant messaging capabilities which we have a well established instant messaging capabilities to be able to underpin this and last but not least you ll be able to execute via our streaming protocols our rfq our auctions as well as third party venues to choose to connect through this portal to me that s a pretty powerful sign of a place in the market that s growing very fast where market participants are pulling us into it because they see us uniquely positioned with the combination of assets that we have to solve this problem and to help the passive investing fixed income space go to that next level of growth operator the next question will come from brian bedell of deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell deutsche bank analyst thanks very much just scott on the data revenue guidance on the constant currency basis from 4 to 6 what do you see as the biggest drivers between the difference of the 4 to 6 is it mostly in pricing or actually new customers and then if i could just ask one a couple of timing questions just on ben i think you said launching the rfq and etf hub later this year when you think that might start contributing from a revenue perspective if that s later this year or 2020 and then just one on timing of nymex development jeff that thanks for your answer prior on that do you think that is the members exchange is something that actually gets up and running and can begin to affect the markets later this year or is that more of a 2020 type of event scott hill chief financial officer yes so i ll start i think there were 3 questions embedded in there the 4 to 6 look i went into last year and i gave you guys a fairly tight data guidance and said we have good visibility into it which i still believe is the case but i think that got interpreted to something like 99 5 certainty in february and so the range is a little wider this year just acknowledging what happened in 18 there were some places where we had some erosion that we didn t expect on the downside in the desktop business some audits that we didn t anticipate in certain quarters as we move through the year and so the reality is that all of those things worked out to a year where we grew the business 5 and as i mentioned asv revenues actually grew 6 but there were some churn that ran through the stock because the 2 million or 3 million difference in any given quarter and a 15 million or 20 million difference on 2 billion of revenue for the year and so i thought it was prudent to try and take some of the volatility out around people who are trying to guess that 1 million on 500 million in the quarter as i said on the call i feel very confident that if you look at the asv number that s going to point you right to the middle of our range and then inside that it s going to be driven by growth in pricing and analytics so ben s laid out a very compelling case for our overall fixed income investment but that s a bit that is effectively the idc business that used to grow 2 to 3 and i m telling you it s going to grow 2 5 times faster than that just a few years later and the asv supports that and there s a lot of momentum in the products that we ve got so i feel very good about the business i think the only thing you should interpret in the widening of the range is just a little bit more hey yes it could be plus or minus 1 versus plus or minus 0 5 last year jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer and brian i ll pick up on the rfq etf hub questions that you had so on rfq we have that capability now so in your question you said is that going to be coming later this year you have to remember from being a longtime exchange and clearinghouse market operator in a number of different asset classes we have expertise in the rfq auction space in many of our markets so we leverage a lot of that expertise and we re able to get those rfq capabilities established on both bondpoint and tmc very rapidly so that capability and functionality is there now and now it s about leveraging our network and our distribution capabilities to get that out which we re very well able to do as we have brought those businesses together with our creditex business that i ve mentioned and also leveraging all of the touch points we have in the fixed income community through our ice data services business for the etf hub that will launch later this year that s our targeted time frame with our steering committee we have completed the requirements definition around that we have the design well under way we have a lot of the most of the major issuers that are onboard helping us with this as well as the major aps and market makers that are helping and assisting with that design and that has enabled us to really lock that down and now we re looking at later this year so you ll see contribution on those we re targeting 2020 and lastly on the members exchange i guess i m not aware that there s management or anybody working on anything but that s really not their obligation to discuss it with us but that said if i was in their position if i wanted to get the market fast i d probably just copy verbatim somebody else s rule book and probably there s a one year ish process one maybe two of course if i copy somebody else s rule book it doesn t give you anything that s unique that exists and i would suspect that there s going to be a lot of scrutiny around the very issue that many pondents are talking about which is are the members going to try to buy us their business toward the exchange rather than seek the best price for their customers in the marketplace and that come along way in the last few years in terms of disclosure and nobility of that behavior but it s not completely done yet so i suspect there ll be a fair amount of conversation and review of just how is order flow intended to be routed with all that said nothing moves fast in the regulatory world and i can tell you that i m watching bakkt try to stand up its regulatory footprint and things are not moving necessarily fast right now in the united states operator the last question for today will come from chris allen of compass point please go ahead chris allen compass point analyst good morning guys i think most of my questions have gone answered i just had a quick numbers question just on the other revenues which are boosted by 5 million in fines in 3q up sequentially again in 4q i m just kind of wondering what s been driving that over the course of the year and kind of the outlook there scott hill chief financial officer so the other revenue chris is where we ve got the revenues associated actually with the interest we earned on our clearinghouse deposit and so as the fed has moved rates up and the balances have grown and they tend to grow at year end people like to part cash at our clearinghouses at year end that s what drove it up and so depending on what the rate environment is as we move through 19 you could see a similar dynamic if rates were constant it will all correlate to the actual levels of collateral cash collateral specifically that to some that s held at our clearinghouse nothing more than that operator this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to jeff sprecher for any closing remarks jeff sprecher chairman and chief executive officer thank you kerry thank you all for joining us on the call and we look forward to really a guided up year again for 2019 and we ll talk to you in the next quarter operator duration 62 minutes call participants warren gardiner vice

20 year of eurozone and gold the old continent is dying the euro is on the brink of collapse this is what you can often hear in the press but is that really the case we invite you to read our today s article about the development of the eurozone in the last twenty years and find out what are the real prospect of the euro and what does it imply for the gold market in december we celebrated 40 years of market reforms in china in january there was another important anniversary 20 years of the euro area so let s move from east asia to europe analyzing the economic situation of the eurozone and its implications for gold after years of negotiations and preparations the euro was launched on january 1st 1999 initially the shared currency was only virtual and the national currencies were still legal tenders used in circulation for ordinary citizens little changed however the exchange rates between national currencies were locked at fixed rates against each other while the european central bank took control over their monetary policy the euro notes and coins entered the circulation three years later the first members included austria belgium finland france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain greece joined the club in 2001 thought it should not have done as it turned out later since then seven more countries slovenia cyprus malta slovakia estonia latvia lithuania entered the eurozone at the beginning everything was running smoothly but then the financial crisis hit the eurozone heavily revealing significant defects in its architecture the fatal flaw is that there is a currency union with the several independent fiscal policies it was quite perverse as the great recession erupted in america however the us with its unified fiscal and political system overcame the crisis relatively quickly on the contrary the eurozone suffered a prolonged depression as the financial crisis morphed into the sovereign debt crisis only when mario draghi famously pledged the ecb would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro the market turmoil calmed the truth is that the europe s monetary union is still unfinished as there is neither a true banking union nor a capital market union this is because the euro was the political project from the beginning not an economic one it was never an optimal currency area but the idea was that the euro would push european countries toward deeper integration making wars impossible as economists we are thus a bit skeptical of the prospects of the common currency and the whole bloc indeed as the chart below shows the eurozone performed worse than the us the former economy grew 31 4 percent by q3 2018 compared to 50 5 percent for the latter chart 1 real gdp growth in the eurozone blue line and in the us red line from q1 1999 to q3 2018 as an index where q1 1999 100 however the pace of growth was also lower than in the us before the introduction of the euro and the common currency did not prevent the whole bloc from growing although the performance differed among the countries actually the euro s performance has been demonized its performance has not been as poor as one could expect given the moderate growth in the gdp and all those gloomy headlines just look at the chart below which presents the eur usd exchange rate since the creation of the euro chart 2 eur usd exchange rate from january 1999 to december 2018 as one can see the euro s value against the us dollar was initially 1 1812 from then to the end of 2018 it dropped to 1 1456 or 3 percent not so bad given that fact that it is used in several economically distinct countries what are the implications for the gold market quite important as it turns out please look at the chart above once again although the correlation is not perfect it s clear that the performance of euro which is the second widely used reserve currency in the world is significantly linked to the gold prices it s true that the eurozone faces many problems including still weak banking system or the rise in populism but investors should acknowledge that the euro area is more robust today than it was at the start of the greek sovereign debt crisis for example the european policy makers established the rescue fund and launched the banking union moreover despite the populist revolution almost 75 percent of the eurozone s population support the euro even in italy almost 70 percent supports the common currency and funny enough when the risk premium increased italy s new government also started to express more sympathy towards the euro all this means that the euro is out of the danger zone at least in the short run actually the slowdown of the u s and china s expansion could push investors towards the euro denominated assets especially when the ecb starts finally hiking its interest rates if that happens and the euro strengthens against the us dollar in the second half of 2019 the price of gold may go up thank you if you enjoyed the

improvement was primarily due to an increase in graphite electrode pricing the weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes rose to 9 937 per metric ton mt in 2018 including 9 950 per mt in the fourth quarter during 2018 graphite electrode demand and pricing remained positive due to a combination of growth in electric arc furnace steel manufacturing long term reductions in electrode manufacturing capacity and limited supply of petroleum needle coke the primary raw material for graphite electrodes net income for 2018 increased to 854 million or 2 87 per share compared to 8 million or 0 03 per share in 2017 likewise fourth quarter 2018 net income increased to 230 million or 0 79 per share compared to 56 million or 0 18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted ebitda from continuing operations also climbed to 1 2 billion in 2018 compared to 96 million in 2017 fourth quarter adjusted ebitda from continuing operations climbed to 326 million compared to 57 million in the prior year period higher graphite electrode revenues were the primary driver of higher net income and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations cash flow from operations increased to 837 million in fiscal year 2018 up from 37 million in 2017 fourth quarter cash flow from operations increased to 224 million in the quarter up from 3 million in the prior year period this increase was primarily due

required by law whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise non gaap financial measures in addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with gaap we have provided certain financial measures that are not in accordance with gaap ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations are non gaap financial measures we define ebitda from continuing operations a non gaap financial measure as net income or loss plus interest expense minus interest income plus income taxes discontinued operations and depreciation and amortization from continuing operations we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as ebitda from continuing operations plus any pension and other post employment benefit opeb plan expenses impairments rationalization related charges initial public offering expenses acquisition and proxy contest costs non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar related party tax receivable agreement expense stock based compensation and non cash fixed asset write offs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is the primary metric used by our management and our board of directors to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we monitor adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplement to our gaap measures and believe it is useful to present to investors because we believe that it facilitates evaluation of our period to period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature allowing comparison of our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods unaffected by differences in capital structure capital investment cycles and fixed asset base in addition we believe adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and similar measures are widely used by investors securities analysts ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities we also monitor and present to investors the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations because we believe it is a useful and widely used way to assess our leverage our use of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments including any capital expenditures to augment or replace our capital assets adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect expenses relating to our pension and opeb plans adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect impairment of long lived assets and goodwill adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect initial public offering expenses or acquisition and proxy contest costs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect related party tax receivable agreement expenses adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect rationalization related charges stock based compensation or the non cash write off of fixed assets and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure in evaluating ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the reconciliation presented below our presentations of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be construed as suggesting that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non recurring items when evaluating our performance you should consider ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations alongside other financial performance measures including our net income

compared to 551 million in 2017 net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 also increased to 533 million compared to 192 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the improvement was primarily due to an increase in graphite electrode pricing the weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes rose to 9 937 per metric ton mt in 2018 including 9 950 per mt in the fourth quarter during 2018 graphite electrode demand and pricing remained positive due to a combination of growth in electric arc furnace steel manufacturing long term reductions in electrode manufacturing capacity and limited supply of petroleum needle coke the primary raw material for graphite electrodes net income for 2018 increased to 854 million or 2 87 per share compared to 8 million or 0 03 per share in 2017 likewise fourth quarter 2018 net income increased to 230 million or 0 79 per share compared to 56 million or 0 18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted ebitda from continuing operations also climbed to 1 2 billion in 2018 compared to 96 million in 2017 fourth quarter adjusted ebitda from continuing operations climbed to 326 million compared to 57 million in the prior year period higher graphite electrode revenues were the primary driver of higher net income and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations cash flow from operations increased to 837 million in fiscal year 2018 up from 37 million in 2017 fourth quarter cash flow from operations increased to 224 million in the quarter up from 3 million in the prior year period this increase was primarily due to higher net income full year 2018

described in the risk factors section of our quarterly reports on form 10 q and other filings with the sec these factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with

as of the date on which the statements are made we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward looking statement except as required by law whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise non gaap financial measures in addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with gaap we have provided certain financial measures that are not in accordance with gaap ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations are non gaap financial measures we define ebitda from continuing operations a non gaap financial measure as net income or loss plus interest expense minus interest income plus income taxes discontinued operations and depreciation and amortization from continuing operations we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as ebitda from continuing operations plus any pension and other post employment benefit opeb plan expenses impairments rationalization related charges initial public offering expenses acquisition and proxy contest costs non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar related party tax receivable agreement expense stock based compensation and non cash fixed asset write offs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is the primary metric used by our management and our board of directors to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we monitor adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplement to our gaap measures and believe it is useful to present to investors because we believe that it facilitates evaluation of our period to period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature allowing comparison of our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods unaffected by differences in capital structure capital investment cycles and fixed asset base in addition we believe adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and similar measures are widely used by investors securities analysts ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities we also monitor and present to investors the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations because we believe it is a useful and widely used way to assess our leverage our use of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments including any capital expenditures to augment or replace our capital assets adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect expenses relating to our pension and opeb plans adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect impairment of long lived assets and goodwill adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect initial public offering expenses or acquisition and proxy contest costs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect related party tax receivable agreement expenses adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect rationalization related charges stock based compensation or the non cash write off of fixed assets and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure in evaluating ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the reconciliation presented below our presentations of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be construed as suggesting that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non recurring items when evaluating our performance you should consider ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations alongside other financial performance measures including our net income loss and other gaap measures

american economic sanctions have been the worst crime against humanity since world war two america s economic sanctions have killed more innocent people than all of the nuclear biological and chemical weapons ever used in the history of mankind the fact that for america the issue in venezuela is oil not democracy will surprise only those who watch the news and ignore history venezuela has the world s largest oil reserves on the planet america seeks control of venezuela because it sits atop the strategic intersection of the caribbean south and central american worlds control of the nation has always been a remarkably effective way to project power into these three regions and beyond from the first moment hugo chavez took office the united states has been trying to overthrow venezuela s socialist movement by using sanctions coup attempts and funding the opposition parties after all there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état united nations human rights council special rapporteur alfred de zayas recommended just a few days ago that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as a possible crime against humanity perpetrated by america over the past five years american sanctions have cut venezuela off from most financial markets which have caused local oil production to plummet consequently venezuela has experienced the largest decline in living standards of any country in recorded latin american history prior to american sanctions socialism in venezuela had reduced inequality and poverty whilst pensions expanded during the same time period in america it has been the absolute reverse president chavez funnelled venezuela s oil revenues into social spending such as free 6 healthcare education subsidized food networks and housing construction a mural in caracas reads the courageous people will defend venezuelan oil in imperialism photo afp in order to fully understand why america is waging economic war on the people of venezuela one must analyse the historical relationship between the petrodollar system and sanctions of mass destruction prior to the 20th century the value of money was tied to gold when banks lent money they were constrained by the size of their gold reserves but in 1971 u s president richard nixon took the country off the gold standard nixon and saudi arabia came to an oil for dollars agreement that would change the course of history and become the root cause of countless wars for oil under this petrodollar agreement the only currency that saudi arabia could sell its oil in was the us dollar the saudi kingdom would in turn ensure that its oil profits flow back into u s government treasuries and american banks in exchange america pledged to provide the saudi royal family s regime with military protection and military hardware it was the start of something truly great for america access to oil defined 20th century empires and the petrodollar agreement was the key to the ascendancy of the united states as the world s sole superpower america s war machine runs on is funded by and exists in protection of oil threats by any nation to undermine the petrodollar system are viewed by washington as tantamount to a declaration of war against the united states of america within the last two decades iraq iran libya and venezuela have all threatened to sell their oil in other currencies consequently they have all been subject to crippling u s sanctions over time the petrodollar system spread beyond oil and the u s dollar slowly but surely became the reserve currency for global trades in most commodities and goods this system allows america to maintain its position of dominance as the world s only superpower despite being a staggering 23 trillion in debt with billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground and with the world s largest oil reserves venezuela should not only be wealthy but her people the envy of the developing world but the nation is essentially broke because american sanctions have cut them off from the international financial system and cost the economy 6 billion over the last five years an anti imperialist mural in caracas photo reuters without sanctions venezuela could recover easily by collateralising some of its abundant resources or its 8 billion of gold reserves in order to get the loans necessary to kick start their economy in order to fully understand the insidious nature of the venezuelan crisis it is necessary to understand the genesis of economic sanctions at the height of world war two president truman issued an order for american bombers to drop fat man and little boy on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki killing 140 000 people instantly the gruesome images that emerged from the rubble were broadcast through television sets across the world and caused unprecedented outrage the political backlash forced u s policy makers to devise a more subtle weapon of mass destruction economic sanctions the term weapons of mass destruction wmd was first defined by the united nations in 1948 as atomic explosive weapons radioactive material weapons lethal chemical and biological weapons and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above sanctions are clearly the 21st century s deadliest weapon of mass destruction in 2001 the u s administration told us that iraq had weapons of mass destruction iraq was a terrorist state iraq was tied to al qaeda it all amounted to nothing in fact america already knew that the only weapons of mass destruction that saddam had were not nuclear in nature but rather chemical and biological the only reason they knew this in advance was because america sold the weapons to saddam to use on iran in 1991 what the u s administration did not tell us was that saddam hussein used to be a strong ally of the united states the main reason for toppling saddam and putting sanctions on the people of iraq was the fact that iraq had ditched the dollar for oil sales the united nations estimates that 1 7 million iraqis died due to bill clinton s sanctions 500 000 of whom were children in 1996 a journalist asked former u s secretary of state madeleine albright about these un reports specifically about the children america s top foreign policy official albright replied i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it clearly u s sanctions policies are nothing short of state sanctioned genocide over the last five years sanctions have caused venezuelan per capita incomes to drop by 40 percent which is a decline similar to that of war torn iraq and syria at the height of their armed conflicts millions of venezuelans have had to flee the country if america is so concerned about refugees trump should stop furthering disastrous foreign policies that actually create them under chavez venezuela had a policy of welcoming refugees president chavez turned venezuela into the wealthiest society in latin america with the best income equality president chavez funnelled venezuela s oil revenues into social spending photo afp another much vilified leader who used oil wealth to enrich his people only to be put under severe sanctions is muammar gaddafi in 1967 colonel gaddafi inherited one of the poorest nations in africa however by the time he was assassinated gaddafi had turned libya into africa s wealthiest nation perhaps gaddafi s greatest crime in the eyes of nato was his quest to quit selling libyan oil in u s dollars and denominate crude sales in a new gold backed common african currency in fact in august 2011 president obama confiscated 30 billion from libya s central bank which gaddafi had earmarked for the establishment of an african central bank and the african gold backed dinar currency africa has the fastest growing oil industry in the world and oil sales in a common african currency would have been especially devastating for the american dollar the u s economy and particularly the elite in charge of the petrodollar system it is for this reason that president clinton signed the now infamous iran libya sanctions act which the united nations children s fund said caused widespread suffering among civilians by severely limiting supplies of fuel access to cash and the means of replenishing stocks of food and essential medications clearly u s sanctions are weapons of mass destruction not so long ago iraq and libya were the two most modern and secular states in the middle east and north africa with the highest regional standards of living nowadays u s military intervention and economic sanctions have turned libya and iraq into two of the world s most failed nations they want to seize libya s oil and they care nothing about the lives of the libyan people remarked chavez during the western intervention in libya in 2011 in september 2017 president maduro made good on chavez s promise to list oil sales in yuan rather than the us dollar weeks later trump signed a round of crippling sanctions on the people of venezuela on monday u s national security adviser john bolton announced new sanctions that essentially steal 7 billion from venezuela s state owned oil company at that press conference bolton brazenly flashed a note pad that ominously said 5 000 troops to colombia when confronted about it by the media bolton simply said president trump stated that all options are on the table america s media is unquestionably the most corrupt institution in america the nation s media may quibble about trump s domestic policies but when it comes to starting wars for oil abroad they sing in remarkable unison fox news cnn and the new york times all cheered the nation into war in iraq over fictitious weapons of mass destruction whilst america was actually using sanctions of mass destruction on the iraqi people they did it in libya and now they are doing it again in venezuela democracy and freedom have always been the smoke screen in front of capitalist expansion for oil and the western media owns the smoke machine economic warfare has long since been under way against venezuela but military warfare is now imminent trump just hired elliot abrams as u s special envoy for venezuela who has a long and torrid history in latin america abrams pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the iran contra affair which involved america funding deadly communist rebels and was the worst scandal in the reagan era abrams was later pardoned by george bush senior america s new point man on venezuela also lied about the largest mass killing in recent latin american history by u s trained forces in el salvador there is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d état a un human rights council rapporteur alfred de zayas pointed out that america s aim in venezuela is to crush this government and bring in a neoliberal government that is going to privatise everything and is going to sell out a lot of transitional corporations stand to gain enormous profits and the united states is driven by the transnational corporations ever since 1980 the united states has steadily devolved from the status of the world s top creditor country to the world s most indebted country but thanks to the petrodollar system s huge global artificial demand for u s dollars america can continue exponential military expansion record breaking deficits and unrestrained spending america s largest export used to be manufactured goods made proudly in america today america s largest export is the u s dollar any nation like venezuela that threatens that export is met with america s second largest export weapons chief amongst which are sanctions of mass destruction garikai chengu is an ancient african historian he has been a scholar at harvard stanford and columbia university contact him at the article first appeared in counterpunch
in the late 1970s the residents of st louis mich found their community in the middle of a superfund site an area of land and water deeply contaminated by velsicol formerly michigan chemical years later with the cleanup largely failing a citizen taskforce took on responsibilities of rebuilding in civic empowerment in an age of corporate greed michigan state university press 2012 professor edward c lorenz evaluates several case studies in community development perhaps the solution to rising damaging corporate irresponsibility in this excerpt from the book s introduction lorenz begins the argument that communities are the agents of civic reform while innumerable historic examples exist of abuse of individual power and excessive self interest early twenty first century global financial crises illustrate that such abuses can impact large numbers of people and communities individual excess transitioned into a fundamental societal problem when its pathologies were magnified in corporations no longer properly controlled by either civic processes or cultural norms as the new century s financial crises unfolded a common error of analysis focused on relatively recent changes in law or policy that encouraged imprudent behavior such as the repeal of bank regulations in the previous decade the problems that became evident in the fall of 2008 had been brewing in american business and civil society for decades and were grounded not merely in contemporary leadership mistakes however grievous but in much longer term civic economic and environmental ideologies and practices there is no better way to see this than through a case study of a group of firms that at one time or another were linked to fruit of the loom politically and economically they often modeled exploitation if not contempt for local communities their workers and their investors environmentally the former chemical subsidiary velsicol left a multistate legacy of carelessly dumped chemical and radioactive wastes rather than be distracted by flagrant recent financial misjudgments this case study reveals the need for widespread and systematic reforms ranging from u s institutional leadership practices to renewed citizen empowerment if the sources of the problems are to be addressed the case of fruit of the loom exposes two primary sources of the economic and cultural maladies of the new millennium as well as effective ways of curing them first the firm s history illustrates how poor corporate and civic leadership can negatively affect workers and residents of host communities the natural world and ultimately the economic viability of companies themselves advocates of sustainable capitalism have called these three dimensions of corporate impact the triple bottom line velsicol s behaviors which first appeared confined to egregious environmental practices demonstrated that disregard for any of the three dimensions likely will undermine continued success in the other two the business media as well as the scientific and technical professionals who worked for and with the firm blindly dismissed early concerns with the company s environmental impact or later the movement of fruit s jobs out of historic host communities as inevitable adjustments to allow the company to remain competitive the firm s bankruptcy in late 1999 proved the error of such compartmentalized economics reviewing the history of this company is especially helpful because of its links to some of the most flawed leaders in finance and government as the national economy unraveled in 2008 and 2009 even casual observers of u s leadership recognized fruit s collaborators as failures whether junk bond promoters such as michael milken insurance schemers at aig or officials of the federal reserve all had helped fruit flounder yet had survived its collapse for another decade the core danger of the 2008 09 collapse as with the earlier problems in savings and loans was not the loss of jobs and wealth but that the response would be the use of short term public subsidies to allow failed leaders and practices to continue the public therefore urgently needs to review the longer term history of the behaviors that underlay the crises rather than focus only on mistakes tied to mortgages or auto technology the study of fruit of the loom and the companies that became part of its complex structure shows for example that the insurance giant aig did not merely speculate carelessly in the subprime mortgage market but speculated more generally in other high risk insurance schemes examining the history of fruit of the loom also shows the long term consequences of deregulation of the financial sector and promotion of excessive debt financing while detrimental to the firm s workers host communities natural environment and outside investors these schemes transferred massive amounts of wealth especially savings accumulated over many years of productive business activity to the private accounts of speculators much as the 2008 09 bank bailout transferred public subsidies to the private accounts of bank owners second beyond the details of corporate skullduggery and administrative incompetence revealed by the fruit of the loom case the firm s history especially that of the velsicol subsidiary chronicles the evolution of an ideology and methodology for exploiting the environment and people firms like velsicol relied heavily on the power arising from professional expertise and effectively used it to control citizen objections to their egregious behavior as with so many mid twentieth century u s manufacturers respect for the leaders of fruit of the loom arose from a long history of innovation and entrepreneurship within components of the fruit empire the firm s experts pioneered the production of ubiquitous products such as underwear and the window envelope and made technological advances in aluminum casting and fluorescent lighting a nobel laureate praised one of its chief scientists community development leaders celebrated the philanthropy of its owners yet several of the firm s great philanthropists equally symbolized the pursuit of naked self interest environmentally the history of the firm exemplifies what thomas berry called the central human issue and the central earth issue of the twenty first century that after centuries of industrial efforts to create a wonderworld we are in fact creating wasteworld a nonviable situation socially the history of fruit demonstrates how separation of corporate ownership and leadership from the communities in which the firm operated encouraged the transfer of wealth from the producers it also imposed excess risk on the workers and their workplace exorbitantly enriching managers and their institutional collaborators finally the firm s behavior illustrates the timeless need for civic institutions to adopt and enforce regulations to protect communities and the natural world from pillage and abuse with the rise of what political scientists labeled interest group liberalism in the middle of the century fruit exemplified how firms undermined even corrupted civic capacity they retrained citizens to pursue individual interests in jobs and cheap consumer goods rather than seek the more amorphous but much more important long term public interest the leadership at fruit of the loom and its affiliates created numerous problems that parallel fundamental troubles in the u s policymaking process while some link these difficulties to the reagan administration s advocacy of deregulation and neoliberalism this study shows that those problems had earlier manifestations more deeply rooted in the dominant american theory of political economy the company s controversial abuses of the environment and workers began in periods often marked by progressive regulatory regimes this investigation suggests that the widely shared free market ideology that dominated both political parties in the second half of the twentieth century facilitated these abuses the transition to an era of deregulation did not correspond to intensification of these wrongs in fact some progress in addressing the firm s problems occurred after the appearance of reaganomics the fruit case is important because it clarifies that neither the liberal nor neoliberal ideologies behind the dominant u s policy process effectively protects the public interest and it also suggests a procedural approach and supporting ideology that do identify and defend that common good the story of the firm s contamination and later financial collapse did not end with a fully negative result in st louis michigan the only community where the firm left multiple highly contaminated sites and one where the local plant was shuttered and demolished citizens modeled a response that might well be copied by those facing similar fates not only did st louis citizens join together to aggressively confront the firm and docile regulators but they displayed concern and support for the other communities and global civic culture threatened by the firm and its allies elsewhere they concluded that if a humane policy process marked by restraint and integrity is to emerge in the world communities familiar with the failure of current corporate and civic leadership must learn from their local experience but act globally confronting related abuses of the natural world workers communities and investors fruit of the loom and velsicol chemical two examples of corporate irresponsibility two cases may serve to substantiate that corporate irresponsibility and the ensuing damage originated years before late twentieth century deregulation both cases show the variety of destructive impacts that resulted from the absence of civic responsibility among corporate leadership one primarily costing jobs the other contaminating the natural world the first example occurred at a factory of west point stevens the large apparel firm acquired by fruit of the loom in 1988 this company like the subsequent example demonstrates how firms that passed in and out of the fruit of the loom empire were adversely affected by that experience west point stevens especially the old j p stevens part of the firm had been infamous for hostility to organized labor in the 1960s and 1970s stevens fought a protracted battle with the amalgamated clothing and textile workers union actwu during what some would characterize as the height of progressive u s liberalism stevens held off the actwu organizing campaigns for two decades a confrontation immortalized in the oscar winning movie norma rae the movie which appeared in 1979 described the successful labor organizing activity of crystal lee jordan at the o j henley plant in roanoke rapids north carolina in fact it took nineteen months after the release of norma rae before the company signed a comprehensive union agreement a few weeks before ronald reagan won the white house for the next two decades during the peak of what many consider anti progressive neoliberalism the union endured what doomed the actwu was not hostility from the reagan administration but the excesses of corporate raiders who perfected a scheme that permitted speculators with modest means such as fruit of the loom s bill farley to acquire companies he procured fruit in 1984 by borrowing billions and then attempted to pay down his debt using assets of its various affiliates such as west point while farley s efforts to acquire west point stevens transpired during the era of deregulation he as so many of his junk bond compatriots refined the techniques long before 1980 while 1980s deregulation of banking and the stock market facilitated such transactions the rise of institutional investors provided the capital needed by the deregulated market roanoke rapids suffered because these investors focused only on short term growth in stock value resulting from debt financed takeovers of cautious old firms investors like bill farley understood that companies with a large market share and a reputation for innovation could be milked for short term profits if new investment were halted and production moved to low wage countries a firm raided for its cash and trademark could be sold shortly after purchase with much of the acquisition debt following the firm like an albatross for plants such as the roanoke rapids facilities of west point stevens multiple debt financed leveraged buyouts burdened them with pressure for reduced investment in technology and wages in the mid 1980s west point pepperell had borrowed to buy out stevens and then in 1988 farley borrowed 1 6 billion to buy west point the massive indebtedness that grew from these consolidations cursed the surviving firms with unsustainable interest payments the subsequent reduction in technical investment initiated a continuous decline in global competitiveness at one point during his takeover of west point farley s cash flow covered only 70 percent of his interest payments what had been west point s comfortable productivity advantage over foreign competitors disappeared and the firm could only compete by moving production to places where reduced labor costs compensated for low productivity to pay the soaring debt farley squandered assets not only from west point but from highly profitable subsidiaries such as his aluminum casting operation doehler jarvis as the empire collapsed around him farley lost control of fruit of the loom a few months before it entered bankruptcy however the indisputable tragedy of such mismanagement was the closure in spring 2003 of facilities such as the norma rae factory in north carolina the purpose of investigating these cases is to validate the long term nature of the problems at fruit of the loom it was not decimated by 1980s era deregulation or by other short term policy changes such as new trade laws these were not causes but effects of a long term rise of self interested irresponsibility among business leaders institutional investors policy experts and the media which celebrated rather than critiqued the behaviors the norma rae factory did not close in 2003 because of a labor battle it folded after two decades of labor peace because of the incompetence of corporate leaders and the disinterest of the company s investors in actual production this situation did not originate in the 1980s it emerged earlier in what this book contends is a version of u s liberalism that welcomed excessive focus on self interest the second case is that of velsicol chemical a company whose owners egregiously impacted the environment in their pursuit of self interest velsicol chemical and its predecessors had a long history of environmental degradation and explicit contempt for critics of their irresponsibility contrary to those who concentrate only upon the deleterious effect of deregulation in the 1980s velsicol faced its first effective regulation after 1980 and made its worst environmental impacts in the early 1970s the era often identified as the pinnacle of modern environmental policy the history of velsicol is important because it shows that the problems inherent in the political economy of the last century were not rectified by new government environmental regulations some corrective action only occurred when citizens were willing to identify the public interest and to demand accountability from civic institutions and civil society with and without federal environmental laws velsicol defied public law and regulators for decades velsicol had been linked to massive fish kills in the mississippi river yet escaped responsibility because of its effective lobbying company leaders convinced local community leaders in an era of prosperity that jobs were more critical than environmental stewardship after the appearance of rachel carson s silent spring velsicol joined by petrochemical leaders and their collaborators initiated an attack vilifying carson and her allies while one could argue that the attacks on silent spring came before modern environmental regulation the firm s most infamous environmental catastrophe occurred in the spring of 1973 at the height of federal environmental regulation and shortly after creation of the u s environmental protection agency epa velsicol s st louis michigan factory mistakenly shipped tons of a highly toxic fire retardant made of polybrominated biphenyls pbbs in place of an animal feed supplement resulting in pbb s entry into the food chain the incident reveals the failure of the regulatory state to prevent accidents remediation of the consequences of the pbb accident took place under the superfund law officially the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla passed by the lame duck congress in december 1980 after the election of ronald reagan superfund authorized the epa and state partners to identify the worst hazardous waste sites the national priorities list and establish a mechanism to assure funding for their cleanup when the company settled claims after the pbb blunder agreeing to close and contain contaminants at the st louis facility the small town had three superfund sites the former plant site a dumpsite in the middle of a golf course and the former county landfill in the 1980s and 1990s decades supposedly characterized by deregulation superfund evolved with strengthening amendments in 1986 and later reform efforts empowering communities to resist corporate opposition to vigorous enforcement while some communities took advantage of support for informed civic engagement in the regulatory process the media increasingly became an accomplice of corporate interests for example in 2003 after the loss of 50 000 u s jobs and bankruptcy cbs radio provided fruit s lobbyist john albertine with a forum to defend deregulation similarly the detroit news published a series on the twentieth anniversary of velsicol s contamination of the food chain ignoring the long term peer reviewed epidemiological studies documenting a number of serious health problems despite this evidence the news editorialized the pbb case is especially interesting because it was one of the first of a long string of chemical scares caused by rising environmentalist concerns about industrial pollution as mr tobin noted nearly all of those scares have turned out to be medical busts the study of fruit of the loom documents how ideology tended to blind journalists and many applied scientists on the one hand they tended to approach all technical issues with a general faith in scientific progress seeing use of pesticides for example as inherently better than past primitive procedures additionally the persistent faith in individualism and the free market implanted a bias in favor of unregulated progress the detroit news account of the pbb legacy and dr albertine s comments on deregulation both arise from trust in the ability of market forces not only to allocate resources but also to determine the public interest this faith has origins in the early history of the united states and in its excess form is distinctly american confidence in the quest of self interest burdened the united states with special challenges in protecting human and natural resources the exploitation of people or the environment had to become extreme before civil society accepted restrictions on market freedom the disasters at places like st louis or roanoke rapids inescapably resulted from what the great austrian economist joseph schumpeter called the creative destruction that inevitably arose from the success of creative entrepreneurs as scholars of the abolition movement have recorded the united states long had difficulty determining the balance between the self interest of the slave owner and the slave similarly although excessive dumping of poisons into the environment at donora pennsylvania in 1948 were condemned the economic benefits of emitting tiny amounts of endocrine disruptors were not censured despite the costs of altered reproductive behavior the policy process habitually rejected development restraint overturning local regulations as takings of individual rights albert hirschman explained how the american experience moving to a continent vacant of all but indians who were easily pushed aside and forgotten instilled in the civic culture a sense that the challenges arising from excessive individualism were forgotten by going west or otherwise abandoning devastated communities even when americans claimed to be guided by higher principles these values were blatantly phrased in individualistic or libertarian terms as the new millennium approached with the frontier vanished the nation nostalgically renewed the traditional liberal faith in individualism contemporary neoliberals claimed that innovation required the rejection of efforts to force protection of the amorphous community development interests they merged fatalism with fear to condemn any deviation from the principles of laissez faire political economy nobel prize winning economists such as gary becker rationalized growing income inequality not as an affliction or predicament but as proof of the value of education under the concept of human capital formation they converted the mission of schooling especially higher education from imparting wisdom into a hedonistic quest for wealth in the brutal global economy becker and his associates avoided examining the dubious contributions of leaders at firms like fruit of the loom who procured excessive compensation while failing to manufacture products efficiently in nations with strong civil societies the unprecedented productivity of the u s free market provided powerful reinforcement for an economic ideology justifying minimal regulation of the environment and employment leaders emerged in politics and the professions who no longer regarded the economy as a subsystem of the larger civil society but as the total system this trend was especially true in agriculture and its growing use of the latest science including velsicol s pesticides to produce abundant and nearly identical foods citizens became consumers directed not to worry about the wider or longer term consequences of production methods but to enjoy cheap abundance as a leading agricultural economist john ikerd observed to the extent that neoclassical economics includes any remaining element of happiness it most clearly is hedonistic in nature rather than eudaimonic economists commonly refer to overall well being as the ultimate objective of economic activity and in contemporary psychology the terms well being and hedonism are essentially equivalent the current pursuit of economic wealth is a pursuit of individual hedonistic sensory pleasure and the pursuit of individual wealth within this context inevitably encourages the exploitation of others for individual gain and thus degrades the integrity of personal relationships in the last decades of the twentieth century the reappearance of staggering income differences the decline in political participation and the weakening of independent institutions such as churches that previously sanctified the habits of the heart compelled many to worry about the american prospect individualism spread not only from boardrooms to colleges and universities it also thrived in the churches undermining their leavening role that tocqueville saw as nurturing those civic habits of the heart many churches shifted their message from the transcendent and the sacred to individual adjustment personal therapy and the blessing of success the media popularized other movements toward hedonism as did modern public relations practices that promoted unregulated individualism and rationalized its egregious conduct communitarianism as an alternative to damaging entrepreneurship since the early republic some of the great works of social analysis and literature have noted the tension between the excesses of individual freedom and the need to define and protect community for example after touring the united states during the 1830s alexis de tocqueville produced a classic assessment of these tensions in a large federal democracy he understood that all societies walked a fine line between the twin scourges of anarchy and oligarchy on both sides a few powerful or violent leaders emerged bringing oppression exploitation and at its worst pillage and rape to the many after observing the young u s democracy tocqueville concluded his visit hopeful that the u s political culture controlled the worst tendencies inherent in individual freedom through its habits of the heart these habits included a distinctive mix of commitment to republican principles and personal self restraint reinforced especially by the country s vigorous and competing churches although people in the united states sought individual success without hesitation or shame they qualified that pursuit by explaining almost all the actions of their lives by the principle of self interest rightly understood tocqueville added the principle of self interest rightly understood produces no great acts of self sacrifice but it suggests daily small acts of self denial by itself it cannot suffice to make a man virtuous but it disciplines a number of persons in habits of regularity temperance moderation foresight self command and if it does not lead men straight to virtue by the will it gradually draws them in that direction by their habits in 1985 habits of the heart shifted from tocqueville s concept to become the title of a best selling study of the decline of community and the rise of individualism in america habits of the heart was neither the first nor the only investigation of growing concern about personal interest what came to be called communitarianism produced numerous studies during the last third of the twentieth century that critiqued the abandonment of rightly understood as a modifier for self interest and its replacement with naked or radical of course even before the communitarians the general culture had described the extreme pursuit of wealth at all costs as greed and listed it as a deadly sin a number of leading business scholars had expressed concern with the negative consequences of entrepreneurship as much as they celebrated the innovation william kapp once summarized his research as presenting a detailed study of the manner in which private enterprise under conditions of unregulated competition tends to give rise to social costs which are not accounted for in entrepreneurial outlays but instead are shifted to and borne by third parties and the community as a whole when the management guru peter drucker examined the topic in the 1980s he likewise emphasized the need for observing warning signs of entrepreneurship gone wrong rather than focusing on success stories the prevailing justification for entrepreneurial creative destruction was progress communities like st louis in the late twentieth century experienced a contrary fate they witnessed job loss and environmental pollution arising from earlier enterprise with no replacement innovation only abandonment superfund cleanups led by communities the fruit of the loom case is worthy of study because in one community st louis the only town with three of the firm s highly contaminated sites citizens awakened and found their habits of the heart at the turn of the new millennium they organized to challenge irresponsible corporate leadership and the media and experts who defended such behavior the uniqueness of their action is visible through a review of the problems both environmental and economic in many of the other communities that hosted company facilities a number of these communities also tried to confront the closures and contamination left by the company only to fail st louis took advantage of all possible structures and processes to sustain corrective efforts the community s story can be emulated and that makes the story worth telling reforms of superfund administered under the reagan administration and the first bush administration provided an initial structure and funding which empowered st louis citizens once empowered however they continued to insist on a wider role for citizens in policymaking than those reforms envisioned the community s contemporary response began in 1997 after epa and state officials returned to town in 1997 to report that earlier superfund remediation had failed within weeks outraged residents took advantage of the new reforms of superfund to create a community advisory group cag to advise the epa the pine river superfund citizen task force and to secure a modest amount of funding a technical assistance grant tag the tag allowed the citizens to hire their own experts to secure second opinions on technical and scientific issues when the task force started in 1998 it only raised some technical challenges to the government and companies by the end of the next year it sought large funding for a sophisticated health study and in 2000 filed a 100 million claim against fruit of the loom in bankruptcy court the details of that history are at the core of this book providing a model to address the problems from modern corporate irresponsibility and individual excess partnering with a local college for free technical expertise the task force did not stop with aggressive legal tactics slowly it pioneered ways to directly challenge elite expertise in and out of government and in the press early in the millennium cag leaders forced the department of justice to hold three hearings in the community on environmental settlements with the local polluters at the second of these the local community expanded its focus beyond its region inviting people from memphis tennessee who faced velsicol contamination there to come to the st louis hearing this step inaugurated the community s awareness that local groups needed to join together to confront national problems created by irresponsible global leadership the challenge that remained was to link with communities outside the united states where firms such as fruit of the loom have found few requirements to report their impacts on what john elkington has called the triple bottom line people plant and profit relying on weak international regulatory mechanisms the leadership of firms can exploit workers abuse the environment and ignore investor protections consequently in 2007 and 2008 the task force pioneered an approach to global corporate irresponsibility long advised by policy experts to think globally and act locally local environmental activists usually focus on reviewing general environmental issues and then apply those lessons to their specific circumstances by implication the local groups lack the expertise or resources to shape the national or global policy process in 2006 07 the pine river task force learned it was being outmaneuvered in complex policy negotiations by the perceived wisdom developed by global experts and the mechanisms they controlled for justifying policy conferences peer reviewed technical publications and global forums the catalyst for the task force s new strategy materialized when global petrochemical lobbyists began to undermine the global consensus on the restricted use of ddt after the new york times published a story in its science section that argued for use of ddt against malaria in africa and critiqued the waste of funds on superfund cleanups of ddt in the united states the cag determined that it needed a global response the pine river group teamed with alma college to sponsor the eugene kenaga international ddt conference in march 2008 they captured the endorsement of the society for environmental toxicology and chemistry and the international society of environmental toxicologists bringing together african and first world health experts to directly challenge the world health organization and urge support for the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants case studies and solutions this study is guided by the assumption that the case method is an appropriate way to understand the functioning of the national policy process and the vibrancy of an ideology such as neoliberalism in the social sciences there is debate about the value of case studies as one political scientist observed most researchers who work with quantitative methods are averse to doing case studies they presume that case studies cannot test or inspire theory because they suffer from selection bias only work built on large data sets and analyzed dispassionately is acceptable the goal is to create unifying theories based on such theorizing neoliberal political economists have long proposed that regulation inhibits innovation since the late 1970s they have had an opportunity to test their theories beginning with the transportation deregulation of the carter administration and intensifying under president reagan and his successors the country has experienced exceptional levels of economic growth since deregulation began a neoclassical economist can say based on data for the total economy that rational analysis proves that much of the old regulation was bad they boast of the precision of the laws of market economics proven valid by mathematical models a few argue against this methodology nancy cartwright of the london school of economics has warned economists simply do not know enough to fill in their law claims sufficiently the gaps in mathematical models reveal the need for alternative approaches such as the case method used in this study almost a century ago pierre duhem the french mathematician writing about seemingly more precise physical theory extolled the value of studying specific cases between an abstract symbol and a concrete fact there may be a correspondence but there cannot be complete parity the abstract symbol cannot be the adequate representation of the concrete fact while the limits of our theories may be minimized in much of the natural and social sciences our legal system is quite conscious of them kim scheppele professor of comparative law at the university of pennsylvania observed social scientists of a statistical bent often dismiss as anecdota the sort of experiences that had while lawyers and judges often distrust the statistics that social scientists provide because the statistics can t ever be said to be true in a particular case nonetheless the statistical backdrop makes it harder to argue that each accident taken alone is really as bizarre as it sounds to the judge or the lawyer accidents are possible because each case is unique but to the social scientist one could have law without accidents because from the bird s eye view of the patterns very little is truly unpredictable when taken in the aggregate although on the national level theories about deregulation seem correct the case for individuals can be quite different as the country has decreased regulation in the last quarter century the nation has experienced fresh economic activity yet most studies of income distribution show growing inequality during the era without careful analysis of the impact upon specific subgroups in the population macroeconomic data crunching can mask negative impacts upon the majority of the population behind massive benefits arising for a few additionally short term economic gains for a few may fail to measure the long term legacy of unsustainable resource use abandoned communities egregious social dysfunction and individual injustice such conditions may be rampant in a place with immense aggregate economic growth such as the u s mexico border region the fundamental error arises from forgetting that people function not with what scheppele called a bird s eye view but with a very human one they do not only scan the world from the sky to get the big picture they land and feel the complexity on the ground one of the challenges in assessing ideologically driven movements such as neoliberalism is the difficulty of understanding actual as opposed to theoretical impacts the epistemological difficulty with analyzing neoliberalism is that it subsumes the political under the economic work culture even family relations can be reduced to market issues as when reference is made to the labor market yet many people consider work as a source of meaning for life a vocation similarly many citizens assume policymaking is a process of providing equity or justice not merely profits if jefferson was right that one of the three core purposes of government is to promote happiness neoliberalism is woefully inadequate centered on life devoted to economic maximization in real communities numerous citizens assess civic efficacy with standards beyond economic efficiency including equal enjoyment of the environment david rosenbloom captured this complexity of good public policy by saying it must balance three nearly contradictory concerns what he called the managerial the political and the legal the neoliberals fixate on the managerial emphasis upon economic efficiency this approach relies on experts who view individuals impersonally and emphasize the scientific method and rationalism to achieve knowledge by contrast the political approach depends on elected representatives and their agents to address the concerns of society seeing individuals primarily as parts of groups and communities civic leaders ascertain citizen needs and expectations through elections lobbying and other forms of interaction with constituents this is a messy process for on most issues only an intense minority on both sides of a debate has an opinion the third position is explained by scheppele as a civil society based on law citizens expect case by case adjudication reacting to people as discrete individuals with rights who demand procedural due process no matter how inefficient the pbb accident can be approached in each of these three ways from the managerial perspective studies of accidents reveal how often in comparable situations companies and their employees make mistakes the actuarial tables of insurance companies grow from this process however the politician cannot respond to angry constituents by saying it was bound to happen to someone just accept it no the residents of the contaminated watershed or the workers or the farmers expect their political representatives to respond to their problems regardless of the odds finally the judge must decide if the injury from the accident to a specific individual warrants application of a legal sanction neoliberals envision citizens taking the first approach trusting the occasional accident to be essential for economic growth people living in real places not ideologically isolated neoliberal think tanks want the three approaches balanced and applied at the same time unlike a washington lobbyist the citizen grasps that the regulation of self interest is superior to the deregulated economic growth promised by neoliberalism the pbb accident introduced a known carcinogen into the bodies of approximately eight million people worse pbb is not the contaminant that makes the velsicol site in michigan one of the most expensive superfund cleanups massive ddt dumping caused the current remediation but that is not the end of the firm s environmental legacy in filings with the u s justice department in 2002 velsicol admitted responsibility for 165 other sites at least two of which rival the cleanup costs of the one in michigan however they are not the sole disasters that unfolded at the fruit of the loom empire at one point in the late twentieth century fruit s leadership controlled u s businesses employing over 75 000 people by 2004 that employment had fallen to 12 800 while a modest number of those jobs survived abroad human rights groups challenged their value furthermore the leaders of fruit of the loom and its predecessors and descendants repeatedly manipulated corporate finances costing thousands of investors and pensioners hundreds of millions of dollars that these problems happened repeatedly in many places roanoke rapids clarksville memphis and toone tennessee toledo ohio and elsewhere not just st louis proves that the pbb mistake was not simply an accident but a warning of what should have been prevented building sustainable communities this study begins and ends with advocacy of building sustainable communities by promoting alternative forms of policymaking and responsible leadership the evidence from this case study attests to the urgency of the task that john albertine could be a leader at fruit of the loom and still be solicited by the media to comment on regulation demonstrates the need for a renewed civic consciousness and commitment to integrity and sustainability while the word is used too frequently including in the context of this book sustainability means at a minimum that the present generation has the obligation to pass on to future generations an average capital stock of goods services knowledge raw materials that is equivalent to today s a stronger version assumes that some natural resources and ecological processes are critical they cannot be depleted below a certain level without dramatic ramifications while people economic institutions and technological tools and practices change building a sustainable community embraces permanence and not short term exploitation good stewards of such a community struggle to reject the short term and destructive while laboring to promote the general welfare by preserving resources maintaining public law or encouraging vigorous civic life the hope in producing this book is that it will motivate readers to organize their communities and inspire them to promote sustainable public policies one step toward sustainability is to keep rosenbloom s three approaches in balance at its core this study documents the consequences of poor leadership at velsicol its last parent fruit of the loom and other firms linked to them their negative impact upon management practices finance employment and the environment was so damaging to humans as well as to the natural world that this story cries out for a conscious response it proves the need for renewal of civic life as a defense against those who were formerly called robber barons despite the complacent neoliberal demands for less regulation this case makes it clear that that ideology is fatally flawed the pattern for this new civic vitality complies with tocqueville s habits of the heart the community advisory group process of the epa modeled this approach without glorifying a rather minor governmental procedural change the cag was one example of empowered citizens a rare species at the start of the new millennium in america the cag at the velsicol site in michigan regularly objected to legal interpretations and decisions that failed to acknowledge the equity implicit in protecting the environment for future generations in the mid twentieth century political scientists grant mcconnell and theodore lowi warned that u s civil society was in peril because justice had come to be considered as the product of a deal between powerful interests this study concludes with an appeal for emphasis upon rosenbloom s third approach restoring public law to its prominence a core ingredient of a sustainable society is widely respected and fairly enforced public law as a corrective to the emotions and fears they believe are emboldened by modern environmental regulation one school of modern legal scholars calls for injecting natural and social science expertise to the law chicago s cass sunstein has modeled this solution advocating precise scientific calculations of risks and benefits he assumes that with enough data the experts can determine accurately the perils of alternative government decisions while tempting to an academic no amount of research can detect precisely all risks since the long term ones may be assessed incorrectly or remain obscure to contemporary scientists there are innumerable precedents of more general failures of what james scott of yale university terms highmodernist planning thus this study advocates that the experts serve as consultants to an active citizenry in 1978 as the velsicol problems escalated in michigan an environmental aide to governor william milliken an expert employed by a thoughtful public figure of the era voiced concern about local citizens input into the environmental policy process in a letter to a county commissioner he said i have reservations about the kind of citizen committee that was proposing we have learned from past experience that it s awfully easy to frighten the public to a degree which may be unwarranted about toxic chemical problems considering that the expert dominated process yielded a 38 million solution that not only failed to contain the pollution but exposed inhabitants to additional toxins for at least another quarter century the citizens could not have done worse this study teaches that the most basic principle of democracy is right the collective citizenry must control the leaders even their highly trained experts the average citizen is not always correct and there clearly is the need for professionals employed in the civil service to monitor policy implementation however experts and self interested individualists also can be wrong and can be more dangerous if mistaken than a single ordinary citizen whatever the merits for specific environmental policy reinvigorated civic engagement is essential for the good of civil society in order to escape hirschman s pathological excuse of going west the united states needs a corrective to excessive individualism the st louis case especially when contrasted to the other communities harmed by fruit of the loom demonstrates processes and structures to control neoliberal excess and its professional allies in the media and the natural and social sciences this case therefore highlights the endless need to control robber barons and also to regain control of the policy process and mark it with restraint and integrity this study does not end as a pessimistic account of the triumph of neoliberal cynicism but with descriptions of a community empowerment process that has had at least modest success such empowerment resembles other historical examples as this investigation concludes the st louis michigan example is linked hopefully not presumptuously to the battle for humanistic civic life throughout the modern world beginning with the renaissance that linkage illustrates the value of pondering the struggles of the past that pitted special interests against the public good and more importantly restores confidence that communities can achieve a good society as citizens seek to restore expectations and methodologies that support their vision of the long term public interest they can perceive that this is an old fight that must be renewed periodically to restore control over elite economic leaders and their accomplices it is about civic empowerment to direct innovation and enterprise toward the creation of a good society this study celebrates the historic strengths of the american system such as the multilayered federal policy structure with a preference for public decisions which most impact daily lives legislated at the local level another attribute has been the distrust of the corruption and hunger for power of far away experts beginning with the minions of george iii this examination does not reject the civic tradition rather it challenges the twentieth century policy innovation that empowered professionals linked to special interests at the expense of those with a vision of the long term public interest as frank fischer phrased the current debate already talk of democracy all too often serves as little more than a thinly veiled guise for elite government the question is can the democratic process be rescued from the increasingly technocratic elitist policy making processes that more and more define our present age max weber one of the great defenders of the virtues of the modern bureaucratic state but also a perceptive critic of its vices warned citizens to find mechanisms to assert their values while celebrating vigorous local participation in technocratic policymaking this study is not guided either by simplistic adulation of local wisdom or a bias against either business or national political leadership local people often can be foolish primitive superstitious and bigoted they seldom possess the expert knowledge of modern professionals whether physicians accountants or economists nor do they understand global and national political imperatives as do better trained leaders yet this study maintains that local weaknesses must be balanced by concern with the potential immorality of the specialist or the corruption of the washington official the only checks on experts and insiders is either a benevolent dictator or a vigorous public policy process that allows outspoken or outraged citizens to say no the locals can do a lot of irrational things but those may be not nearly as evil in intent or consequence as the health problems spawned by the irresponsible chemists at velsicol or the theft of worker and investor wealth by the devious accountants in the pocket of fruit of the loom s officials an unqualified local manager may cost a handful of his neighbors work when his incompetence causes his business to fail such behavior pales by comparison to the impact of the leadership at fruit of the loom whose actions caused 65 000 workers to lose their jobs and more to surrender their pensions health insurance and investments welcoming business creativity has given the united states its great wealth permitting most residents to live more affluent lives than almost anyone else in the world this study is not oblivious to that achievement in fact many communities adversely affected by the behavior of fruit of the loom wish they had an innovative entrepreneur to bring good jobs to their hometowns nothing written in this study seeks to inhibit innovation some of which inevitably results in failures and errors the cases examined here are not examples of random business failures inevitable in a free economy they are not random accidents such as the unavoidable odds that for every mile driven by millions of drivers some misjudgments will lead to injury and death these cases are more analogous to the accidents of the chronically drunk the public response is no fault insurance for the random driver errors and criminal prosecution for the severely impaired however there have been no criminal prosecutions of leaders involved in the events chronicled here with the exception of one set of charges against velsicol s officials punished by token fines after the firm hired one of the best connected law firms in the country to guide it to victory their success in enriching themselves at the expense of their workers is reason to cease protecting the recklessness of the civically and socially impaired that our media consults them as economic experts rather than exposes their disingenuousness suggests the extent of collusion in their actions and ideology this story intends to encourage corrective actions and embrace of an ideology that envisages reform of our failing civic processes this excerpt has been reprinted with permission from civic empowerment in an age of corporate greedby edward c lorenz published by michigan state university press 2012
content hosted by iono fm nompu siziba the zimbabwean economy is in dire straits inflation has started ratcheting up again with levels of 50 now being bandied about it s said that over 80 of zimbabweans are unemployed while public servants are poorly paid people s incomes are not rising in line with inflation and this is having serious socioeconomic impacts on that society zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa was out in europe looking for aid it s not clear what he managed to secure in the meantime his finance minister says his reform programme is on track and zimbabwe will recover in due course advertisement continue reading below well to break down the zimbabwe story i m joined on the line by veteran freelance journalist barry d wood who has been covering that country for over three decades barry thanks very much for joining us what s happening on the ground in zimbabwe in terms of food availability on the shelves and affordability and did the fuel price increase earlier this year dramatically reduce demand for it and those long snaking queues barry wood hello nompu it s a delight to talk to you i think the answer to your question is that it s a disaster it s as bad as any economy i ve seen you asked about food yes there is some availability but the people don t have enough money to purchase it you ve had a 67 increase in the food price today there are shortages of bread in harare and in bulawayo that is a real problem you had a few questions there why don t you repeat one of the key ones and i ll address that nompu siziba yes i think you ve answered all of them there is food availability you say but people can t afford it they don t have enough money the third question was really around the fuel price the extent to which that has contracted demand in that economy barry wood yes that s very important because just about two and a half weeks ago we had this more than doubling in the fuel price and that was indeed intended both to produce revenue for the government in excise tax and to alleviate the fuel queues which it did they had stretched on for kilometres causing great frustration that had its intended effect in terms of getting rid of the queues mainly because people could not afford to buy fuel so you are finding people having to pay more to ride the minibuses and they are having to park their cars because they don t have enough money to buy fuel and indeed there are still people coming across from botswana from mozambique from south africa to fill up their tanks because they use the black market rate for the currency and then use that to buy fuel that is cheaper than it is at home so it s an awful mess nompu siziba we know that zimbabwe has been suffering from liquidity issues for a long time what essentially has been the basic problem and what role have technology services like econet played in helping to overcome the issue barry wood let me talk about the econet for just a moment and talk about the problem of currency you don t have monetary stability anybody whether a family an individual or a company requires stability so they can make plans and use their money if they have some sensibly listeners will know that in 2008 9 the zimbabwe currency imploded so that it had the world s highest rate of hyperinflation hyperinflation is defined as inflation of more than 50 a month read zimbabwe inflation hits 50 as zanu pf big wigs milk crisis so they went to the us dollar now that might have been a mistake because the dollar went up in value that priced zimbabwean exports out of its export market then about three or four years ago they introduced this bond note business the bond note was introduced at 1 1 it wasn t called the zimbabwean dollar because the zimbabwean people knew enough about the previous zimbabwean dollar they wouldn t use it well the bond note held its value for a while but now it s no longer 1 1 it is 4 1 then you have this rather ridiculous system called rtgs which is real time gross settlement that is a financial account a bank transfer so you could say that zimbabwe has three monies and people have to scramble to try to make sense of it you mentioned liquidity nompu indeed there aren t enough us dollars because they have a trade deficit they have a fiscal deficit and the bond notes have collapsed in value nompu siziba finance minister mthuli ncube has a reform programme in place with some supporting it saying zimbabwe will have to go through the necessary pain in the short term some of the pain that you ve just described what is the reform programme all about and at what juncture does it seek to resolve the foreign exchange problem advertisement continue reading below barry wood right if you go back to the coup against robert mugabe november 17 people were so hopeful and you suddenly had a lot of freedom that you didn t have under mugabe people were hopeful of a better life when ncube was brought in he s an eminent economist highly respected he has taught at wits he has been the chief economist at the african development bank people had high hopes for him but people i talk to in harare are very disappointed he spends too much time on twitter he has had great difficulty in making the transition from being an academic economist to a policy maker yes he has a reform programme he wants a new money but of course saying so caused people to think hold it the new money is coming this bond note must be really worthless so that caused the bond note to go down even further what is his programme he wants to open the economy he can t open the economy unless he has financial reserves to back up the new currency that he says will be introduced in 2019 you can t get international support as long as people are being beaten in the street and killed for protesting this is the conundrum this is why no one nompu is optimistic in the short term about the zimbabwean economy nompu siziba that was going to be my next question about the crackdown and the violence and even the deaths we heard that at least 12 people died following the protest when the fuel price increases were announced obviously that is not going to augur well for confidence among the likes of the imf the international monetary fund are they really going to put their money with a regime which is still brutalising its people you ve addressed that i guess so is there any optimism on your part after president mnangagwa invited members of the opposition to meet with him today to map out a framework read zimbabwe president invites opposition leaders for talks barry wood that s a nice first step a very good first step but i m afraid the crisis has reached such a proportion that there is more required there probably has to be a national government of some sort you see ncube is not going to be able to make these reforms work let alone bring in any currency unless he has international monetary support coming to him in real hard currency that may not be used but if it s there it communicates to the people that there is going to be monetary stability well the problem is the americans who have a veto power in the international monetary fund have a list of sanctions against individuals including the president and the vice president and the crackdown which you mentioned and i ve been on the phone to harare today there s been more crackdown and a brutal beating of a demonstrator the army and the police you could say are really brutal at this present moment so there is no prospect of an international monetary fund loan there is no prospect of anything more i come to your question about econet which is run by strive masiyiwa who is in exile an expatriate zimbabwean based in london and by the way he is feared by the government and the government doesn t like him he keeps the economy going with econet and ecocash meaning that if you ve got a liquidity crisis and of course zimbabweans do you can put some kind of credit on your phone and buy things on your phone it s a brilliant system and it has worked but it s only a band aid nompu siziba barry time has caught up with us but thank you very much for the insight we are going to speak to you more often in the year to catch up on what s going on in zimbabwe we are very very grateful take care barry wood it s my pleasure

leaked wikileaks doc reveals us military use of imf world bank as unconventional weapons this u s coup manual recently highlighted by wikileaks serves as a reminder that the so called independence of such financial institutions as the world bank and imf is an illusion and that they are among the many financial weapons regularly used by the u s government to bend countries to its will by whitney webb february 07 2019 information clearing house in a leaked military manual on unconventional warfare recently highlighted by wikileaks the u s army states that major global financial institutions such as the world bank international monetary fund imf and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are used as unconventional financial weapons in times of conflict up to and including large scale general war as well as in leveraging the policies and cooperation of state governments the document officially titled field manual fm 3 05 130 army special operations forces unconventional warfare and originally written in september 2008 was recently highlighted by wikileaks on twitter in light of recent events in venezuela as well as the years long u s led economic siege of that country through sanctions and other means of economic warfare though the document has generated new interest in recent days it had originally been released by wikileaks in december 2008 and has been described as the military s regime change handbook what s happening with venezuela wikileaks publication of us coup manual fm3 05 130 unconventional warfare provides insight dos department of state ic intelligence community uwoa uw operations area arsof us army special operations forces pic twitter com ez0tgqhesw wikileaks wikileaks january 28 2019 wikileaks recent tweets on the subject drew attention to a single section of the 248 page long document titled financial instrument of u s national power and unconventional warfare this section in particular notes that the u s government applies unilateral and indirect financial power through persuasive influence to international and domestic financial institutions regarding availability and terms of loans grants or other financial assistance to foreign state and nonstate actors and specifically names the world bank imf and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd as well as the bank for international settlements bis as u s diplomatic financial venues to accomplish such goals are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter the manual also touts the state manipulation of tax and interest rates along with other legal and bureaucratic measures to open modify or close financial flows and further states that the u s treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac which oversees u s sanctions on other nations like venezuela has a long history of conducting economic warfare valuable to any arsof uw campaign this section of the manual goes on to note that these financial weapons can be used by the u s military to create financial incentives or disincentives to persuade adversaries allies and surrogates to modify their behavior at the theater strategic operational and tactical levels and that such unconventional warfare campaigns are highly coordinated with the state department and the intelligence community in determining which elements of the human terrain in uwoa are most susceptible to financial engagement the role of these independent international financial institutions as extensions of u s imperial power is elaborated elsewhere in the manual and several of these institutions are described in detail in an appendix to the manual titled the financial instrument of national power notably the world bank and the imf are listed as both financial instruments and diplomatic instruments of u s national power as well as integral parts of what the manual calls the current global governance system furthermore the manual states that the u s military understand that properly integrated manipulation of economic power can and should be a component of uw meaning that these weapons are a regular feature of unconventional warfare campaigns waged by the united states another point of interest is that these financial weapons are largely governed by the national security council nsc which is currently headed by john bolton the document notes that the nsc has primary responsibility for the integration of the economic and military instruments of national power abroad independent but controlled though the unconventional warfare manual is notable for stating so openly that independent financial institutions like the world bank and the imf are essentially extensions of u s government power analysts have noted for decades that these institutions have consistently pushed u s geopolitical goals abroad indeed the myth of world bank and imf independence is quickly eroded by merely looking at the structure and funding of each institution in the case of the world bank the institution is located in washington and the organization s president has always been a u s citizen chosen directly by the president of the united states in the world bank s entire history the institution s board of governors has never rejected washington s pick this past monday it was reported that president donald trump nominated former bear stearns economist david malpass to lead the world bank malpass had famously failed to foresee the destruction of his former employer during the 2008 financial crisis and is likely to limit world bank loans to china and to countries allied or allying with china given his well established reputation as a china hawk in addition to choosing its president the u s is also the bank s largest shareholder making it the only member nation to have veto rights indeed as the leaked unconventional warfare manual notes as major decisions require an 85 supermajority the united states can block any major changes to world bank policy or the services it offers furthermore the u s treasury secretary former goldman sachs banker and foreclosure king steve mnuchin functions as the world bank s governor though the imf is different from the world bank in several respects such as its stated mission and focus it too is largely dominated by u s government influence and funding for instance the imf is also based in washington and the u s is the company s largest shareholder the largest by far owning 17 46 percent of the institution and also pays the largest quota for the institution s maintenance paying 164 billion in imf financial commitments annually though the u s does not choose the imf s top executive it uses its privileged position as the institution s largest funder to control imf policy by threatening to withhold its imf funding if the institution does not abide by washington s demands as a consequence of the lopsided influence of the u s on these institutions behavior these organizations have used their loans and grants to trap nations in debt and have imposed structural adjustment programs on these debt saddled governments that result in the mass privatization of state assets deregulation and austerity that routinely benefit foreign corporations over local economies frequently these very institutions by pressuring countries to deregulate their financial sector and through corrupt dealings with state actors bring about the very economic problems that they then swoop in to fix guaidó hits up imf given the close relationship between the u s government and these international financial institutions it should come as little surprise that in venezuela the u s backed interim president juan guaidó has already requested imf funds and thus imf controlled debt to fund his parallel government this is highly significant because it shows that top among guaidó s objectives in addition to privatizing venezuela s massive oil reserves is to again shackle the country to the u s controlled debt machine as the grayzone project recently noted venezuela s previous elected socialist president hugo chávez broke ties with the imf and world bank which he noted were dominated by us imperialism instead venezuela and other left wing governments in latin america worked together to co found the bank of the south as a counterbalance to the imf and world bank however venezuela is far from the only country in latin america being targeted by these financial weapons masquerading as independent financial institutions for instance ecuador whose current president has sought to bring the country back into washington s good graces has gone so far as to conduct an audit of its asylum of journalist and wikileaks publisher julian assange in order to win a 10 billion bailout from the imf ecuador granted assange asylum in 2012 and the u s has fervently sought his extradition for still sealed charges ever since in addition last july the u s threatened ecuador with punishing trade measures if it introduced a measure at the un to support breastfeeding over infant formula in a move that stunned the international community but laid bare the willingness of the u s government to use economic weapons against latin american nations beyond ecuador other recent targets of massive imf and world bank warfare include argentina which awarded the largest imf bailout loan in history just last year that loan package was unsurprisingly heavily pushed by the u s according to a statement from treasury secretary mnuchin released last year notably the imf was instrumental in causing the complete collapse of the argentinian economy in 2001 sending a poor omen for last year s approval of the record loan package though it was released over a decade ago this u s coup manual recently highlighted by wikileaks serves as a salient reminder that the so called independence of these financial institutions is an illusion and that they are among the many financial weapons regularly used by the u s government to bend countries to its will and even overthrow u s disfavored governments whitney webb is a staff writer for mintpress news and has contributed to

accelerating to 25 growth in the quarter which translated into 22 constant currency revenue increase in addition to ongoing strength in our u s outbound digital business we are also making great progress in increasing westernunion com penetration and growth in key european markets including france the uk and germany for our entire money transfer business revenues increased 1 in constant currency transactions however increased 4 in the fourth quarter and cross border principal volume grew 8 in constant currency terms so underlined metrics are summed ph business solutions showed improvement with revenue s increase in 5 constant currency led by strong growth in europe we again delivered good performance in the payments area of b2b including the education vertical this quarter however we also had good growth in foreign exchange services aided by customer hedging related to increased foreign exchange volatility the bill payments businesses positive mix results with argentina results in u s dollar terms continuing to be heavily impacted by negative currency translation from a profit perspective margins were solid at 19 2 for the quarter and 20 1 for the year as effective cost management and our wu way lean programs contributed to stability operating cash flow for the u s came in as projected as we generated over 800 million and we returned over 740 million to

progress on this initiative in 2018 i mentioned the strong results we experienced with westernunion com which exceeded 0 5 billion in revenue last year our digital expansion efforts to drive future growth also continued to ramp up as we launched approximately 20 new westernunion com or mobile app markets over the last year particularly in asia latin america and the middle east consumer can now access our online or mobile services to initiate transactions in more than 60 countries plus many territories and our digital penetration covers markets that represents approximately 75 of global remittance market principal we believe this will give us additional future revenue growth opportunities for our digital business in addition we embedded digital money transfer services into more third party platforms such as safaricom in kenya and added large principal transfer products for our westernunion com services in the uk we also continue to expand our bank account payout services as you now have the capabilities to send to nearly 100 countries and territories reaching billions of accounts and we are seeing strong growth in account payout transactions the combination of our extensive retail footprint and our growing digital presence and account payout network creates a very strong proposition for consumers providing them the ability to send and receive in whichever method and currency they prefer around the world looking at our progress with new cross border payment opportunities in october we announced our collaboration with amazon in which we utilize our global platform to process international e commerce payments under this agreement amazon customers in various markets will have a new way to pay in person at our retail agent locations over the last few months we have launched pilots for this service in 10 markets mainly in asia and south america coverage in this market is now being increased and we are working with amazon on the expansion roadmap for additional countries in the future turning to our operational efficiency accomplishments the wu way continue to help us run the company better we implemented more than 40 lean deployments last year trained more than 6 000 employees on lean processes and achieved approximately 70 million in run rate savings from wu way driven efficiency programs these savings help fund investment in growth initiative technology and core proficiency such as gdpr in 2019 we will continue to push forward these strategies on a macro level there is uncertainty on economic growth in many parts of the world as well as foreign exchange headwind and geopolitical concerns but we expect stable financial performance in 2019 our business is very diverse with 20 000 corridors and no one no one country outside the u s represent more than 7 of our revenues historically our customers have been resilient even in challenging economic times our transaction and principal trends were how to exit exiting 2018 and we expect that to continue we believe the pricing environment will remain stable and do not expect major pricing changes in 2019 overall our 2019 outlook calls for ph low single digit constant currency revenue growth and operating margin of approximately 20 and continuing strong cash flow generation and return of funds to shareholders but we ll give you more information on the 2019 outlook in a few minutes and right now i would like to turn the call over to him to provide more details on the fourth quarter results raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thank you hikmet as i review 2018 financial results i will focus primarily on the fourth quarter the similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules fourth quarter revenues of 1 4 billion declined 3 or increased 2 on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period currency translation net of the impact from hedges reduced fourth quarter revenues by approximately 69 million compared to the prior year primarily due to continued declines in the argentine peso the decline in the peso negatively impacted total revenue by 4 percentage points while the effects of inflation on our argentina businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately 2 percentage points and the consumer to consumer segment which represented 80 of company revenues in the quarter revenue declined 1 or increased 1 constant currency while transactions grew 4 total c2c cross border principal increased 5 or 8 on a constant currency basis while principal per transaction was flat or increased 3 constant currency the spread between c2c transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 5 with a negative 2 impact from currency mix had a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points in the quarter while pricing had a negative impact of 1 compared to the prior year period the 1 pricing impact primarily reflects actions taken in the middle east earlier in the year excluding the middle east the net pricing change for the rest of the world was positive both for the quarter and the full year turning to the regional results north america revenue was flat on both a reported and constant currency basis while transactions grew 2 the u s to mexico corridor delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter but this was offset by continued declines in the u s domestic money transfer business in the europe and cis region revenue increased 1 or 2 on a constant currency basis led by france and spain while transactions in the region increased 8 revenue in the middle east africa and south asia region declined 7 on a reported basis or 6 constant currency while transaction growth improved to 3 as the previously avoided ph price reductions are delivering good results and driving volume latin america and caribbean region continue to deliver strong consequently revenue growth driven by argentina ecuador peru and brazil revenue in the region was flat in the quarter or increased 16 constant currency while transactions grew 11 in the apac region revenue declined 9 or 8 constant currency and transactions were down 4 with australia china and new zealand contributing to the decline westernunion com continue to deliver strong growth as revenue grew 21 or 22 constant currency on transaction growth of 25 westernunion com represented 12 of total c2c revenue in the quarter and for the full year business solutions revenues increased 3 or 5 on a constant currency basis and represented 7 of company revenues in the quarter other revenues which consist primarily of our bill payments businesses decreased 11 in the quarter or increased 10 on a constant currency basis and represented 13 of total company revenues pago facil walk in business in argentina continued to grow transactions and local currency revenue aided by inflation but declined in u s dollar terms while our speedpay u s electronic bill payments revenue also declined in the quarter the depreciation of the argentine peso negatively impacted other reported revenue by 21 percentage points in the quarter while argentina inflation is estimated to have positively impacted other reported and constant currency revenues by approximately 11 percentage points turning to the margins and profitability our consolidated gaap results reflect some significant special items primarily in the prior year so i am providing the adjusted metric comparisons to better reflect the fundamentals of the business the adjusted metrics in the current quarter exclude the impact of tax expense related to changes for the accounting of the u s tax act i refer you to our press release tables for a detailed listing of the adjustment item amounts for the prior year quarter and full year the consolidated operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19 3 up from 18 in the prior year on an adjusted basis the adjusted operating margin expansion was driven by lower bad debt marketing and incentive compensation expenses which were partially offset by higher other corporate expenses and technology spending foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of 4 million in the current quarter compared to a negative impact of 7 million in the prior year period we achieved approximately 10 million of incremental savings from wu way initiatives in the fourth quarter which gave us approximately 45 million of incremental savings for the full year on an absolute basis we achieved approximately 70 million of savings from wu way for the year ebitda margin was 24 2 in the quarter which compared to 22 5 in the prior year period on an adjusted basis the gaap effective tax rate was 9 8 in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis the tax rate was 6 3 compared to 14 3 in the prior year period the decrease in the adjusted tax rate was primarily due to discrete items in the current year period as we previously stated certain of the impacts related to the tax act enacted in december of 2017 we provisionally estimated and additional effects we recorded during each quarter in 2018 in the fourth quarter changes in our estimates related to the tax act resulted in an 8 million tax expense the accounting for the tax act was completed during the fourth quarter so there will not be any additional adjustments going forward adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was 0 49 which compared to 0 41 in the prior year period the increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to the increased operating profit margin a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding partially offset by lower reported revenues the c2c margin was 23 3 which compared to 21 5 in the prior year period the margin increase was driven by lower bad debt marketing and incentive compensation expenses which were partially offset by higher technology spending business solutions operating margin was 5 4 in the quarter compared to negative 3 2 in the prior year period the increase in operating margin was primarily due to high technology and other operating expenses in the fourth quarter of last year business solutions ebitda margin was 16 2 which compared to 8 1 in the prior year period operating margin for the businesses included in other was 1 8 in the quarter which compared to 7 9 in the prior year period the year over year margin decline was primarily due to lower revenue and higher corporate expenses as certain corporate expenses including spending for m a and other strategic action activities are recorded within other turning to our cash flow and balance sheet cash flow from operating activities was 821 million for the full year which includes the negative impact of approximately 200 million related to payments from special items capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately 91 million at the end of the quarter we had cash of 973 million and debt of 3 4 billion we returned 133 million to shareholders in the quarter including 84 million in dividends and 49 million of share repurchases which represented approximately 3 million shares the outstanding share count at quarter end was 441 million shares and we had 544 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires in december of this year turning to our outlook we expect stable financial performance in 2019 despite a slowing global economic environment similar to 2018 we expect a low single digit constant currency revenue increase excluding any benefit related to argentina inflation due to the strength of the dollar against the argentine peso and major european currencies we expect reported revenue growth to be in a range of a low single digit decrease to a low single digit increase operating profit margin is expected to be approximately 20 as we continue to focus on cost efficiencies and lean management implementations to offset investments and some negative impact from foreign exchange we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 17 to 18 in 2019 including negative incremental impact from the u s tax act beat provision we have identified and are in the process of implementing structural actions to mitigate the adverse impact of beat for the future the 2019 rate outlook includes partial benefits from our mitigation efforts as they rolled out during the year we currently expect the effective tax rate in 2020 to be lower in the mid teens level reflecting the full effect of mitigation due to the increase in tax rate this year our 2019 outlook anticipates full year earnings per share to be in a range of 1 83 to 1 95 while cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately 1 billion as we have mentioned previously we are currently considering various strategic alternatives for certain of our business units but do not have anything to announce at this time and there is no assurance any transaction will occur if we were to complete a divestiture during the year our outlook would need to be adjusted to reflect the related revenues and profits that would be removed as well as the impact of any use of proceeds so to summarize we delivered our full year adjusted financial outlook in 2018 and made good progress on key strategic initiatives we continue to generate solid cash flow and return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases in 2019 we expect stable business solid margins and continued strong allocation to shareholders operator we re now ready to take questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question will come from tien tsin huang of jpmorgan tien tsin huang jpmorgan analyst hi good afternoon thanks for all the details so just on i ll start on the dot com business you mentioned acceleration you mentioned new countries i m curious if you have an outlook for 2019 and what is it driven by is it again more country expansion or are you just getting more penetration within your existing countries thanks hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director hi tien tsin good afternoon i think both we will continue to do that because our u s outcome digital business is very strong and these are done by our inaudible existing customers but these are been here for a longer time and as you know we are also in the european union countries longer time with out westernunion com transaction so that s going to continue but we are also very excited finding new customer segments in our new countries and once you launch a country it takes the time with the marketing activities and european ph customers but the growth rates are very promising uk ph in q4 also with a 25 transaction growth which is also very encouraging and we are just starting in middle east and asia with our expansion i think that s really encouraging numbers so that gives us additional channels and still these customers are new to us additional customers doesn t cannibalize our existing business tien tsin huang jpmorgan analyst okay and just my follow up quickly just i wanted to ask on wu way i heard the 70 million in savings but how where are you now in terms of potentially seeing better revenue production from wu way where the investments going maybe just a quick update there hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yes i think we are still very excited about the wu way initiatives i think there s still room from efficiency side also from growth opportunities how we implement that our focus is definitely on digital growth and we do when we launch in a new country we do launch it with wu way initiatives the amazon pay for our platform to amazon the collaboration with amazon was done all by a wu way and that has been launched in 10 countries now and we are just starting to promote that in the 10 countries and there from the efficiency side i still believe there is some room and we gave our guidance about 20 margin for 2019 and while we do this efficiency program we do invest also on the growth that will going to continue to happen and we are wu way is definitely the way we operate raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer and tien tsin on the 70 million that is our full run rate we don t plan to call out any further savings there but we will keep driving for a lean and operating efficiencies and keep reinvesting in the business tien tsin huang jpmorgan analyst understood thank you guys hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you operator the next question will come from bryan keane of deutsche bank bryan keane deutsche bank analyst yes hi guys thanks for taking my questions wanted to ask about the regions in the north america region i see transactions accelerated in the quarter at least year over year from 1 to 2 but constant currency revenues went down a couple points and then eu and cis similar transactions remain the same at about 8 but the constant currency revenues dropped a couple of points just curious what s causing that and is that the mix that you called out there raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yes brian hi this is raj in north america what you re seeing on the revenue side is is it grow over from higher foreign exchange spreads we had in the previous year fourth quarter and some of those spreads were reversed during the course of the year but transaction growth as you mentioned continued to accelerate so that s good our u s outbound business actually did quite well we had 7 transaction growth there which has been accelerating during the course of the year but some of the pricing and mix impacts had the impact that you re referring to and then in europe and cis the dot com business overall grew very well during the course of last year and in the fourth quarter and also our dmt business in france so those had some mix impacts the slowdown in the fourth quarter is again related to higher fx spreads that we had earlier in the year in those markets that we reversed that part of those so transaction trends have been quite healthy and just some of the mix in pricing impacts are having the revenue impact that you re seeing there bryan keane deutsche bank analyst okay got it and then hikmet just thinking about the new opportunities you re talking about for cross border is there a way to quantify that in terms of a revenue opportunity those could produce hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director we don t give that revenue guidance there but i believe there is a new opportunity additional customers like we did with westernunion com these customers like the offering our platforms to third party like safaricom or amazon pay are really new customers that we didn t offer that and that s the only way they can do transactions because if you are in brazil a local currency owner is it in the form card or it is cash you can t do international transactions because you can t use your credit card international credit card there s no international credit card but the people want to buy online want to buy global and pay local and that s really our platform which we developed over years enabled that technology wise compliance wise and settlement wise do that so we are very excited about that and amazon is definitely a partner but there are other also opportunities to expand our platform to new our payments capabilities paying in local buying global it s definitely something we are excited about bryan keane deutsche bank analyst okay great thanks for the color guys hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator and the next question comes from darrin peller of wolfe research darrin peller wolfe research analyst hey guys thank you just when you go into the mix impact hey on the c2c segment that drove the two points of difference between transaction growth and revenue growth and i think you mentioned one point pricing can you just explain a little more around the mix you re talking about and then when we think of 19 outlook just if that s going to persist that kind of a mix impact is going to persist raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah hi darrin the mix is something that we don t really try to forecast it s difficult to forecast it really is related to where the growth is coming from it s mostly geographic mix around the world so what it means optionally is that we re getting faster growth and lower revenue per transaction corridors and that s what you re seeing coming through it varies a little bit this time it was minus 2 and that has to do with product mix but mostly it s a geographic mix issue that s showing up there so it s not something that we try to forecast overall but our revenue outlook envisions whatever might happen there darrin peller wolfe research analyst okay i guess just a higher level question then i mean we re seeing very strong growth of the dot com business continue and to your point accelerate and i guess it just feels like at some point there should be an inflection where it s big enough to more than offset some of the headwinds that you ve seen whether it s on mix or its pricing and potentially something that starts to align more with the volume growth on cross border or even the transaction growth on cross border you re seeing which is higher than revenue when did can you give us a little idea as to when you think that could really start to show and materialize so that the digital side is big enough for you but it offsets other areas raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer well digital or wu com business is it s obviously much larger than it was a few years ago was over 500 million last year but it s still only 12 of consumer revenues so it s going to i don t know when that inflection point is clearly digital we still see very strong growth opportunities retail we think will be a flattish type grower maybe well single digit but we have had negative growth in some of our other areas which is really what s dragging us down wu is accelerated which is good but our bill payments businesses were negative particularly speedpay and so we need to get better overall performance there if we could get to mid single digit type of growth and that gives us good flexibility and what we can do overall so not just digital digital certainly has to be there but other components of our business also have to perform a little bit better than they have been darrin peller wolfe research analyst right so is there anything just i ll leave it there is there anything more you think that s possible to do from a restructuring standpoint beyond those potentially the b2b business we ve talked about maybe it s the sort of domestic money transfer anything else that can be done around restructuring that could help the overall growth profile in more near term manner thanks again guys hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think yes i mean we re are looking constantly about to structural opportunities growth areas and on the efficiency margin part obviously in the retail money transfer business as raj discussed earlier i think it s going to we have a good market there and it s going to be flattish but the growth will come from digital environment then the totally the 12 of our revenue it s the largest by far in the digital money transfer environment and so the countries we rolled out they will come also adding additional customers so i think if you really keep the customers on the retail side and add customers from the digital side our c2c business is quite solid and will drive the growth i think we have to really look at our payments part payments business and on the payments part the volatility last three months helped us in the b2b business but that student pays the payments business c2b business going very well and we are building on that we have to seek some the b and c and the domestic business and speedpay domestic business has been a challenge right and that has an overall impact to our company s performance and the domestic business has been something we are focused not to turn around darrin peller wolfe research analyst okay alright guys thank you hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thanks raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thanks darrin operator and the next question comes from james schneider of goldman sachs james schneider goldman sachs analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my question the latin american region is one that continues to put up very good revenue growth for you i think you talked about the u s outbound mexico in particular can you maybe kind of i ll call out a any other countries or geographies that really contributed to that what initiatives you have going into other countries and then b to what extent that was helped by the addition of wu com in those quarters raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer hey jim this is raj the latin america revenue growth is really the outbound growth from latin america if that s what you re referring to now is driven that we mentioned by argentina ecuador through results so we ve had a quite healthy growth in some of those other markets even though argentina was impacted on a reported basis by the currency devaluation there other markets have been doing quite well in that region so the conditions are quite good we it s a relatively small piece of our overall revenues like ours 9 of total c2c revenues so we ve seen continued good performance there at least on a constant currency basis and in terms of dot com it s certainly a focus that we have in terms of expanding dot com presence in latin america so that s really what we re focused on hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think jim generally c2c business has been stable especially the cross border cities the business is stable latin america as raj said it is a smaller part of our business but we had also strong growth in despite besides u s outbound also in europe uk germany and france have been going very well but we also see now good transaction growth in the middle east as you recall jim last year we implemented some promotions there now they are showing good returns i think that s also a good sign and shows how stable our businesses is so digital growth is definitely driving the top line but there are also very stable number in the retail money transfer business james schneider goldman sachs analyst that s helpful thanks and then maybe as a follow up some of your payments peers have kind of noted a notable slowdown in cross border travel and i understand most of your trends are driven by migration though which are longer term things are you seeing anything in the business as you start q1 that gives you a little bit of pause in terms of a potential macro slowdown and to what extent is that baked into your guidance hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director macro environment is definitely challenging but as you look at our business we are in 200 countries we have 20 000 corridors so we clearly are a portfolio particularly a play in our case right so we do actually don t see big changes on economical environment in the retail money transfer business on the online on our dot com business even strong growth continue to happen the strong growth and q4 exit was very good especially as i mentioned earlier in transaction and in principal amount the brazilian constant currency principal was about 8 growth in q4 and so i think the environment is stable however there is some concerns global concerns on the economical environment james schneider goldman sachs analyst thank you operator next we have a question from james faucette of morgan stanley james faucette morgan stanley analyst thank you very much inaudible wu com and as you are expanding into markets and corridors what are you having to do from a pricing perspective to encourage and attract volumes and how should we think about the pricing opportunities that over time that s my first question raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer hi jim this is raj agrawal when we expand into new markets we really look at the digital business has been new incremental revenues to us so we go into any new market making sure that we price competitively with whatever else might be available in terms of similar service now we have a very unique service offering because the majority of our revenues payout from payout at retail location even though they may be digitally initiated so we do try to price competitively and it doesn t really carry the legacy of the retail business so it s new incremental business to us we price it very competitively we try to get the business and it s really about marketing and acquiring new customers more than anything else in terms of it s not really driven by the pricing we re going to make that a competitive offering and then we just need to tell consumers about the offering james faucette morgan stanley analyst got it and then 2019 outlook you guided to roughly 20 margins 2018 carrying different parts of the year you re a bit above this funnel so can you talk through what would be the puts and takes that would allow you maybe to put back above 20 sequentially in 2019 raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean we comfortable with our 20 margins it could be a little bit above little bit below it just depends on how things play out if you look at the pieces we are investing in the growth opportunities like digital like the relationship we have with amazon we re also investing back in regulatory items like privacy in other areas and then when we are in a low growth environment like we are and we have negative fx impact it s more challenging to get leverage on our cost structure so we do need to get better revenue growth overall to be able to drive better margins which is our objective but for this year we re comfortable with the 20 level james faucette morgan stanley analyst thank you very much raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator the next question comes from jason kupferberg of bank of america merrill lynch jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey thanks good afternoon guys just wanted to start on c2c i know the constant currency revenue growth there i think came in at 1 a little bit below recent trend and the comp is kind of tough in q1 and so i just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the near term trajectory on c2c in constant currency terms raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah again we don t give outlook on a specific business unit jason but we if you just think about the pieces retail business is likely to be a flattish type grower and digital we continue to see good growth opportunities there and it s going to become a bigger and bigger piece so i think the consumer business overall will be solid and stable jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer and wu way is about getting good growth in the other areas that the consumer business should be relatively stable the underlying transaction terms have been good so we ve had some variation due to pricing and mix factors last year in the fourth quarter but overall the underlying metrics have been solid jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then just in terms of sensitivity in 2019 guidance i mean if we just think about some of the macro uncertainties out there hypothetically if there was to be let s say a hard brexit is that would that be a material issue for western union as there been any risk adjustment in the 2019 forecast for that scenario i mean it just seems like it s a decent size remittance market overall so wanted to get your perspective raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah from an operational standpoint we are very well positioned we re ready to operate under a number of different scenarios and you can t predict exactly what the outcome will be economically i don t know exactly what to expect but i would say overall for europe we ve assumed a slightly softer environment but from an operational standpoint we re ready to go regardless of what scenario plays out that s right hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah again we believe that we are prepared we ve been working on that i think operational and customer wise we don t see any issues here and just from the risk side i mean as i mentioned earlier none of our countries are bigger than 7 of our revenue outside the u s so we are operating in 20 000 corridors and i believe that we are very well positioned despite the economical challenges globally we are well positioned to respond and we believe that we are going to have a stable 2019 jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you for the thoughts raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from ashwin shirvaikar of citi ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst hey guys i guess my question is on operating margin raj you mentioned lower bad debt is this some action you ve taken maybe big data analytics type of stuff what s needing to this can you comment raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer no i would say ashwin that that s really a one off item we have that special items i d say that helped us on the bad debt side but overall from a bad debt standpoint we do a pretty good job of managing some of it is certainly using data analytics but generally we managed the risk in our business quite well and most of our business is on a good funds model so there s not really too much that we have to deal with there so i think we are in a good shape the bad debt was primarily high bad debt expense in the prior year quarter so the comparisons were just favorable ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst got it got it and then the other question with regards to the cross border principal growth i was just kind of wanted to delve a little bit deeper into that what s driving that is it sustainable is it specific geos channels is it any is it reflective of any immigration related concerns people send back money to their home countries anything detail on that hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director i think from general overall business we had a good u s to mexico business is doing well i would say that our principal amount the middle east turning around as i mentioned earlier the transactions growth has been good so it impacts the principal amount also and european business has been stable also as you know we have some issues in the u s domestic money transfer business but that s not the cross border principal and generally the cross border principal has been in a good environment and the market growth has been healthy i think the people are using cross border transfer and thank god they are using western union and going to continue to use western union ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst sounds like geo mix then thanks operator and our next question is from jennifer dugan of suntrust jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi i m on for andrew jeffrey looking at the b2b and other revenue growth both appear very healthy but the margins in both were a bit weaker can you just go into some of the dynamics there raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah the in the b2b business you re looking at the third quarter comparison and margins third quarter to fourth quarter jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yeah raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yes in the b2b business we just benefited in the third quarter from timing of expenses so that was really distributed timing i would say the overall margin for the full year were around 6 for the b2b business or ebitda margin close to 17 which is more representative of the overall margins there and then in the other revenues or other area of our business we did have lower overall revenues in that business but we also had other corporate expenses because certain corporate expenses that are for strategy m a costs fall into the other part of our business we just that s where we record them so that impacted the margins as well jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great and then one other thing i want to talk a little bit more i know you ve mentioned some of the tech investments around digital and some of these opportunities with amazon in addition to some of the regulatory expenses but looking more at the tech investments what is the timeline for some of these investments timeline to getting them done and then the return timeline raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer well the digital investments will be ongoing our strategy there is really to drive growth and expansion all over the world so we re going to it s a continual effort to improve the features and functionality in our platforms we re launching new sites all the time and so that investment will continue for the digital expansion we re also leveraging our platform for new opportunities like the amazon relationship so there is some spending that goes with that so we continue to invest in the technology area and that s really the drive long term growth and expansion and so that s really our strategy hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director i think on sorry i think from also if you are already in a country like u s or europe with the digital which we invested already it s really winning new customer expanding in the marketing wise really making promotions on the digital and if you launch new country there were we do investments and as raj mentioned earlier we want to be in 200 countries like we are in our retail money transfer business we want to be also with our digital business in 200 countries and we are expanding that that s one of our biggest competitive advantages connecting 200 countries with 200 countries and using our payout network in retails with 50 000 locations but also billions of accounts we can drop money really momentarily very fast in accounts directly in more than 100 countries so that investment is going and you could see in the numbers the growth numbers are coming from digital investments jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great thank you hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator the next question comes from ramsey el assal of barclays ben budesheim barclays analyst hi everybody this ben budesheim ph on for ramsey i just had a question on the u s outbound you ve mentioned that has grown quite nicely and accelerated over the course of the year and i guess i m just wondering what s going right is it more digital revenues kind of taking more becoming bigger piece of the whole or taking share or can you kind of parse that out a little bit for us raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah it s a number of things that are going well there there is some pricing and mix impact that s impacting the revenues overall but the transaction growth has been accelerating dot com u s outbound and our digital business has been going very strong and u s to mexico was also very strong and that was being offset by some other things but those two areas have been very strong in our price positioning for u s outbound is very competitive to other offerings and so i would say it s a combination of those two things a cross border wise u s outbound to other countries has been doing quite well for us and there is some impacts on revenues from mix in pricing but otherwise it s the transaction terms and principle terms have been healthy ben budesheim barclays analyst okay great and then just on the tax rate you had mentioned that you expected become down a little bit in 2020 can you give us any sense of like the timing over the course of 2019 will there be some like a step down quarter by quarter or it will be a little more unpredictable any color you can give there would be great raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah we are very pleased with the solution that we re putting in place for the beat issue that came about as part of u s tax reform that was really causing unwarranted double or triple taxation on a portion of our u s outbound business so we are implementing a solution it s going to be implemented during the course of this year i don t have a quarterly tax rate to give you but certainly it s going to be implemented during the course of this year and next year we see our tax rate falling back down to the mid teens level for really the foreseeable future given the current tax environment there we re in so we are very pleased with that outcome ben budesheim barclays analyst thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator and the next question comes from vasundhara goel of kbw vasundhara govil kbw analyst hi thanks for taking my question i guess my first question was on the free cash flow guidance i guess you guys are guiding to slightly better free cash flow even though revenue that are expected to be flattish and margin stable so what s driving that better conversion raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer well in our operating cash flow is for about 1 billion in 2019 and last year in 2018 we had 200 million of special type items that we paid for and that s why the operating cash flow last year was just over 800 million so that s the primary difference overall in the operating cash flow vasundhara govil kbw analyst got it and then in terms of the eps outlook what are you guys including in terms of contribution from share buybacks and more broadly could you talk a little bit about your appetite for m a and how it fits into your capital allocation priorities are you looking at deals actively and if so what type of targets are would you be interested in raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah we don t give a specific amounts for share buyback or the impact eps but if you look at last few years we ve been buying between 400 million and 500 million of stock each year we basically been returning 100 of our free cash flow back to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends and so i expect that we re going to be active again in 2019 and then in terms of m a strategy we re always looking for the right kind of acquisition that fits within our cross border payment strategy we would love to do the right kind of digital type of acquisition but it has to be at the right price and it has to really whatever we do has to advance the ball for us we have a great platform we have great capabilities so whatever we do has to really give us some additional capabilities that fit strategically within our strategy vasundhara govil kbw analyst thank you very much raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator next we have a question from tim willi of wells fargo timothy w willi wells fargo analyst hi thanks and good afternoon a couple of questions on digital and then one on amazon but in terms of thinking about digital and the impact around the margin discussion if i do the math correctly right now it appears that the digital channels is effectively driving all of the revenue growth in c2c would that be correct if i just think about its contribution and its revenue growth rate to digital sort of this all growing channel for c2c while sort of the traditional business you can sort of call it flattish or slightly down is that correct first of all raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah digital is going to be the key growth driver timothy w willi wells fargo analyst okay raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer always for us so we use that in the market long term timothy w willi wells fargo analyst okay so if we think about like at 12 i know that there is always lots of moving pieces around margins and scale and investing and expanding that franchise but is there a way to think it like just conceptually that by the time digital is at 20 or 25 of revenue for that c2c is that a way to think about the inflection point about letting the scale and the growths of digital and that what should be inherently pretty attractive margin start to show through i know you ve always said it s profitable it s just not at the same sort of level so rest of the business but i think you ve always sort of said at some point it should be a higher margin business just any updates on that thought process over the next several years raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean tim it s a great question we are in heavy investment mode in that business if you separate the marketing and technology which is a much heavier concentration than the rest of our business we are spending in marketing technology for the long term growth of this business and so today the margins are lower than the rest of the company and that continues to be the goal until we get broad expansion all around the world with digital but when you look at the contribution margin on a percentage basis and i think we ve mentioned this before the incremental margins are actually similar in both the retail and the digital business and it depends on how much money you re sending in the quarter that s involved but the profitability of a transaction in from a percentage basis is actually quite similar to our retail business so it can be a very profitable business we could drive the profitability up overnight if you wanted to but that s not really the strategy we have it really continues to grow our business to 200 countries and territories and then at some point it will be a better contributor to our overall profitability and especially if we have more account channels account to account capabilities that we re building there that will also help the overall margin profile timothy w willi wells fargo analyst yeah make sense i fully understand it just sort of curious if there s a way we could sort of think about a mile of marker there okay it s a 1 billion of revenue we should really start thinking about digital having a positive upward impact on margins but i can understand there s a lot of to go on between point a to point b when you get there my follow up was just on amazon i think over the years again you guys have struck partnerships and trying to leverage this vast network and your brand and your competencies around cross border and risk management some weighs mixed results some have announced that i don t think necessarily there s been a ton of those follow through i guess we point to you over the years but obviously amazon to amazon so i guess i m just sort of curious when you think about this partnership relative to other agreements that have been struck over to many years how you feel or how this evolution may be different and this potentially could be something where hey this actually has really worked and had an impact it really leverage the brand and the network of western union better than other times hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think we are very excited about this opportunity with bigger with largest global online marketplace right i mean and i think amazon wants to get to new customer segments and really offer their product to the new customer segments and they have the product and using our platform our platform is unique we invested over years and we are very proud of our platform not many companies have licenses to operate in 200 countries and we do have it not many companies can settle in 137 currencies acting 137 currency we have it and that technology that regulatory environment puts us in a unique position to offer our platform to amazon now it s a new product as you know it s nobody did that earlier we are the first doing this in partnership with them we are testing it it s very promising it s a 600 billion market for online shopping and i think that s millions of customers don t have an access on that and we hope that our platform will help amazon to offer their products to new customer segment timothy w willi wells fargo analyst great thanks very much for the time hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thanks tim okay laura i will take the final question operator okay the final question will come from bob napoli of william blair bob napoli william blair analyst thank you i appreciate it first question just on the domestic money transfer business and i know that s been a challenge how big is that business now and how much is it declining and do you expect that to continue to decline over the next few years hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think as you bob hello how are you bob as you know that s quite challenging business because as a domestic money transfer business there is some pricing pressure and but there are some loyal customers still using that because they want immediate cash at our western union locations payout and these customers are loyal and staying it is about 8 of our c2c business and it s a declining business and but there are some loyal customers who use that sending money online for instance paying immediately in cash it s quite attractive for many customers raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah bob we don t disclose the growth rates on that but it was about 9 of c2c revenues in 2017 so it s down from 9 to 8 bob napoli william blair analyst okay thank you that s helpful then western union is invested in the education vertical i think in payments and you talked about payments hikmet being the healthy business for you can you give an update on the education vertical and what the opportunities are in that business and i think there are some good competitors out there as well hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah there are some competitors up there definitely but it s a great business for us we acquired globally universities and universities are attracting more and more foreign students for instance if i should was going to that in spain for instance there about 200 000 chinese students studying in spain alone that number puts things in perspective there are millions of millions of students going abroad and studying and they want to pay their tuition local currency and study abroad in their universities and we enable that now we are in few countries with our student pay we met mostly and unless asian ph countries but also we are expanding our university acquisition constantly to offer the product to the new segments i m particularly excited about the future of the western union once we build this c2b abilities we could do that also besides universities also to other verticals i think that gives us a unique position to do the cross border payments for many needs of many customers because we can handle 137 currencies bob napoli william blair analyst can you give us any feel for the size and growth rate of that business hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director we don t particularly break that business but the main growth on the b2b this quarter we had a good also trading business but main growth of the b2b comes from the payments part of the business and it s something that very good raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah just within b2b about half of the business comes from what we can refer to it payments and half of it comes from the basic apec services education vertical is one of the businesses within payments but we don t disclose specific size bob napoli william blair analyst great thank you appreciate it raj agrawal executive vice president chief

executive officer jeff jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you frank after five consecutive years of record earnings 2018 proved more difficult than we anticipated with inflation increasing dramatically luxury vinyl tile impacting other us flooring products and most of our markets slowing in this environment we selectively invested approximately 1 5 billion to enhance our long term performance primarily in new product categories and geographies with greenfield projects and acquisitions cost saving initiatives and buying back shares our industry has faced periods with volatile costs and shifts in consumer preferences before and we have always navigated through them to emerge stronger and a more competitive position and 2018 inflation in the us was primarily driven by increasing material costs escalating transportation and energy costs and constrained chemical supply the tight us labor market increased employee turnover which impacted both efficiencies and training costs our ability to offset these pressures was hindered by continuous inflation more competitive imports due to a stronger dollar and substitution of lvt for other alternatives in the us lvt is taking share from other flooring and it will become a significantly larger part of our portfolio our lvt manufacturing and import strategies are progressing and our margins will improve in the future in the us and europe we are adding more talent to our lvt operations to increase our production efficiency and differentiation in 2019 while we are managing through these conditions we are enhancing the long term value of our business in 2018 we acquired leading flooring companies in australia new zealand and brazil and in europe two flooring distributors and a specialized mezzanine company we entered the european porcelain slab and carpet tile markets we expanded our higher quality ceramic in eastern europe and initiated sheet vinyl production in russia and quartz countertop manufacturing in the united states much of the benefit from these capital investments will be realized in 2020 and beyond as we achieve higher volume mix and productivity turning to the fourth quarter results we generated sales of 2 4 billion up 3 as reported or 5 on a constant currency for the period our adjusted operating income was 241 million or 10 of sales with an adjusted eps of 2 53 as with our first year performance as with our full year performance the period was affected by significant inflation slowing markets and lvt impacting sales of other products even as we executed price increases in many products our business has experienced increased competition and greater pressures on pricing and mix in the period inflation continued to be a headwind across most categories as higher materials flowed through our costs we decreased our manufacturing production in the fourth quarter to adapt to market demand our start up costs in the period were higher than we projected with lvt production improving slower than anticipated our new countertop and sheet vinyl plants initiated manufacturing and our polish ceramic tile expansion was still starting up in the period we purchased about 274 million of mohawk stock reducing our share count by 2 3 million or the equivalent of 3 of our outstanding shares for more details on our segments i ll now turn the call over to chris wellborn w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic thank you jeff for the quarter our global ceramic segment sales increased about 5 as reported or 7 on a constant currency basis to 861 million with headwinds from inflation pricing pressures and lower growth in some of our markets adjusted operating income for the segment was approximately 87 million or 10 of sales in north america our ceramic business increased sequentially but remain challenged due to import pressures and transportation expenses to improve our margins we

well and we are focused on improving our mix and margins we are expanding our customer base and product offering with our dalgress large sizes which replicate porcelain at lower price points we have

position in one of the world s largest ceramic markets the brazilian market is strengthening and both our sales and margins are expanding we have ordered the first phase of new equipment to enhance eliane s operations and margins following the strategy we used to dramatically improve marazzi s profitability we re formulating strategies to optimize our combined brazil and mexico sales in central and south america in europe conditions softened as we went through the period with the italian economy deteriorating the most due to the political uncertainty our exports outside europe which are focused on commercial projects also slowed given these conditions we experienced greater pressure on margins as competition increased we reduced production rates in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so in the first period we are increasing our commercial sales force to boost sales of our premium technical ceramic in retail we are expanding our high end collections in unique thin wall tile products we are gaining traction with our large porcelain slabs which can be used for floors walls and countertops with the expansion of our european ceramic footprint we are increasing the specialization of our plants in italy spain poland and bulgaria to improve our competitive advantages for example we are moving production of our outdoor products to poland where we added new lines dedicated to this category we have increased the production and size capabilities at our bulgarian plant to enhance our sales in lower price points across europe in western europe we are creating a separate sales force specifically for these lower priced collections we anticipate introducing a patented easy insulation tile in europe later this year with these actions we expect to increase the utilization of our european assets as we move through the year the russian ceramic market has grown as the economy improved during the period our sales and profitability increased substantially although the weaker ruble significantly reduced our translated results to overcome inflationary pressures we enhanced our mix and expanded our volume we have installed two new production lines this year which will enable us to grow both our porcelain floor and wall tile business we are launching production of porcelain slabs which are used for floors walls countertops and commercial exteriors in 2019 we will commence production of sanitary ware to make us more complete provider of premium bathroom products to highlight our offering and enhance our brand we are expanding the number of large company owned flagship stores in major metropolitan areas in the fourth quarter our flooring north america segment sales were approximately 974 million decreasing about 3 with an adjusted margin of 9 including start up cost of 7 million the segment sales shipped slowed as we went through the period due to softer existing and new home sales weaker remodeling and inventory reductions by customers in some channels during the period we initiated further price increases to recover higher material and freight costs additionally we launched numerous initiatives to enhance efficiency reduce material cost and improve processes in the us market lvt sales continued to increase impacting the purchase of other flooring in november we announced paul de cock s appointment as president of the flooring north america segment to enhance our results he has changed the management structure to improve our marketing operations and innovation in each flooring product paul has two decades of experience in the industry and joined mohawk in 2005 with the eliane acquisition paul previously led the flooring business for our flooring rest of world segment early in his mohawk career he led our us hard surface business in the period carpet was impacted by the high cost of materials and hard surface alternatives we have increased carpet prices to better align with our costs in our premium smartstrand collections we introduced our new colormax technology which blends colorations with greater clarity and deeper saturation colormax was selected by retailers as the most innovative new product at the recent flooring trade show we also updated our entry level smartstrand collections to enhance their sales we expanded our patented air o unified soft flooring offering to strengthen our increasing

projects across all products many initiatives are being executed to enhance efficiency material cost quality and service we have reinvigorated the premium laminate category through the new investments we made to produce visuals that exceed real wood with previously unachievable water resistance and durability wood sales remain under pressure as we provide other alternatives with superior value propositions both our residential and commercial lvt sales grew substantially during the period as we implemented our sourcing and manufacturing strategy we are offering a premium pergo lvt collection which before introducing has great consumer brand recognition than any other lvt product in the market though we had anticipated even more improvement the speed of our lvt production increased about 20 over the prior period we re adding more engineering resources to further increase productivity formulations and yields long term we are confident that our investment in this technology will provide us with competitive advantages when it is operating at expected levels our flooring rest of world segment delivered fourth quarter sales of 614 million an increase of 12 as reported or 16 on a constant currency basis with acquisitions enhancing our results adjusted margin for the segment was 13 of sales including start up cost of 18 million as we progressed through the period we experienced softening market conditions in both europe and australia lvt sales continued their strong growth and we significantly outperformed the laminate market with our premium collections we have initiated laminate price increases to recover rising costs and currency changes our investments to expand laminate production in europe and russia have increased our market share by delivering differentiated visuals and waterproof features the new lines also supported margin expansion with improved mix and greater efficiencies the expanded production is enabling us to increase our sales in russia which has been constrained by capacity limitations our lvt sales continue to grow dramatically as our production rates increase some of our lvt introductions were postponed until later this period as we overcame technical problems that increased our costs during the fourth quarter we have seen about 15 speed improvements in lvt over the last quarter as our processes have been refined and we anticipate continued improvement in the year ahead the improved performance of the new line will allow us to add unique visuals and performance features to our collections in europe we are gaining

hard surface products distributed under our brand the volume and profitability of our insulation business is improving significantly our polyurethane insulation is taking share from other products as it did prior to prices rising from material constraints since the supply of raw materials has recovered our service levels have improved and pricing has become more competitive with other alternatives our board sales and margins for the year were the highest in the decade the investments we ve made have improved our offering and productivity with the softening economy in the fourth period we experienced sales and margin pressures we have implemented initiatives to increase sales and focus on value added products we re expanding the mezzanine flooring business we acquired last year as we leverage our existing manufacturing and sales organization now i ll pass the call to frank who will review our fourth quarter financial performance frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance thank you chris net sales for the quarter were 2 449 million and grew 3 as reported with the legacy business up almost 1 on a constant exchange rate basis flooring rest of world had the strongest growth with lvt and laminate products performing well both in rest of world and in our north american segment just as a heads up in 2019 the first quarter will have one additional day and then will have one less day in the fourth quarter of 2019 gross margin as reported was 26 4 or 27 1 excluding charges and was down from 32 3 last year inflation of 61 million lower productivity of 24 million higher start up of 17 million plant shutdowns of 15 million and unfavorable foreign exchange of 13 million offset increased volume of 18 million and price mix of 9 million sg a as reported was 17 7 or excluding charges 17 3 compared to 17 1 last year we had unusual charges of 27 million that primarily were related to the godfrey hirst and eliane acquisitions and plant consolidation in north america our operating margin excluding charges was 9 8 down from 15 1 last year inflation headwinds of 62 million along with the impact of increased start up of 18 million shutdown of 15 million and lower productivity of 23 million offset 9 million of improvement in price mix we also had a 7 million headwind from fx ebitda was 381 million in the fourth quarter and 1 7 billion for the full year our interest expense for the quarter was 14 million which compares to 7 million last year the increase was related to early extinguishment of high cost eliane debt our income tax rate improved to 19 2 from 27 2 last year due to the 2017 tax reform act we estimate a first quarter rate of approximately 22 5 to 23 5 and a full year rate of 22 to 23 for 2019 earnings per share excluding charges were 2 53 which was a decrease of 26 compared to last year turning to the segments our global ceramic segment had sales of 861 million fourth quarter sales increased 5 as reported with our legacy business up 2 on a constant exchange rate basis our russian business reported the highest growth and north america improved sequentially on a year over year basis in the quarter operating income excluding charges was 87 million with a margin of 10 1 down from 14 last year inflation of 30 million declining price mix of 6 million and increased shutdown costs of 8 million offset incremental productivity of 13 million and stronger overall volume in the flooring north america segment sales of 974 million decreased year over year by 3 with improvement in price mix of 26 million which was offset by volume weakness in soft surface product lines our operating income excluding charges in this segment was 86 million with a margin of 8 9 compared to 16 7 last year improvement in price mix of 20 million was offset by inflation of 36 million unfavorable productivity of 37 million and 7 million of production shutdowns as well as start up of 7 million we also had 17 million of lower volume in the flooring rest of world segment sales were 614 million an increase of 12 as reported with our legacy sales growing 3 on a constant exchange rate basis lvt had the strongest growth in this category operating income excluding charges was 78 million with the margin of 12 8 compared to 15 8 last year productivity and lower material costs were offset by 5 million of foreign exchange and another 5 million of lower price mix as well as higher start up of 13 million in the corporate and eliminations segments we had an operating loss of 11 million and in 2019 we are estimating a loss ranging between 35 million and 40 million jumping to the balance sheet receivables ended the quarter at 1 606 million with our days sales outstanding at 60 days in the quarter compared to 59 days a year ago inventories ended the quarter at 2 288 million with inventory days at 128 our inventory was up 340 million from the fourth quarter of last year with 70 of the increase from new businesses and acquisitions and 30 of the increase from chinese pre buy and inflation we lowered our legacy manufactured inventory in most categories as we ran production below sales during the quarter our fixed assets for the quarter ended up at 4 7 billion and included capital expenditures of 151 million with depreciation and amortization of 139 million for the full year capital expenditures were 794 million with depreciation and amortization of 522 million we are estimating capex for 2019 to be approximately 550 million to 580 million with depreciation and amortization estimated at 560 million looking at long term debt our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong total debt was 3 3 billion at the end of the quarter with leverage at 1 8 times debt to ebitda jeff i ll turn it back over to you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you frank as we enter 2019 many macroeconomic conditions around the world could impact our results economies have been slowing in most of our markets oil volatility is making our costs unpredictable and the housing markets in many regions are under pressure so our outlook is cautious because of these issues we expect our results to improve through the year in the first quarter we re reducing production rates due to softer environment in most of our markets higher price materials will flow through before we realize the benefits from recent changes the dollar strengthened relative to last year and will have a significant negative impact on the first period we continue to introduce innovative new collections implement price increases and improved manufacturing processes taking all of this into account our eps guidance for the first quarter of 2019 is 2 02 to 2 12 excluding any onetime charges our major product and geographic expansions are at various stages of ramping up as we progress through the year these investments will increase our sales and margins price increases will benefit our results our start up costs will decline and production levels will increase we will realize the potential of these projects in 2020 and beyond as volume and efficiencies increase today the business is strong with substantial resources a broader product portfolio and a more diverse geographic footprint we have a strong balance sheet extensive liquidity and historically low debt leverage in the short term we are taking the appropriate steps to manage through these market uncertainties and we are confident our investments and acquisitions will significantly enhance our long term business we ll now be glad to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question i was hoping you could shed some light on general industry dynamics in the us ceramics market with the 10 ebit margins you recorded which are going lower in the first part of 2019 i guess even if we say you re tracking above that because of the investment headwinds and destocking that are hurting results temporarily where do you think the competitors are from a profitability standpoint and where that marginal production cost is i m trying to understand that given your scale advantages at what point do you start to see the competitors alleviate some pressures that you re seeing on the price cost side jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the competitors we believe are already reducing their production rate significantly in the us market however about 50 or more of the us capacity is satisfied by worldwide supply base and is imported at the same time you have the 10 increase in tariffs from china which is the biggest supplier of imports to the country so you have a lot of dynamics going on we are raising our prices as we speak to recover some of the freight and margin loss we ve incurred so far michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay and then as a follow up you talked about deteriorating slowing sales in many markets can you just give us an update on what market you seemed stabilized since at the start of this year and what markets are continuing to slow down jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the so we see in europe the markets slowing across we have a large part of our sales in italy which is going into a recession and we have the russian market is improving in russia the mexican market decreased in 2018 it was running at double digits in our category in 2017 in 18 it was running negative we think a lot of it was caused by the interactions between the us and them but we see it improving in the us your guess on what s going to happen with the economy and housing is as good as mine this year michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you good luck operator your next question is from the line of stephen kim with evercore isi stephen kim evercore isi analyst thanks very much guys first question is about your lvt production and how or whether your plans have evolved since you started building the two major lines a couple of years ago the two new lines like for instance i m wondering is your intention to focus to new dalton line on like high end rigid lvt and source the rest whereas maybe previously you intended to produce both high end low end rigid or maybe you re planning to do flexible lvt on that line for the time being or is it basically just that your plan is essentially unchanged just merely delayed so whatever you can share about your thinking and how it may have evolved will be great an as for the rigid product you are currently making where is this product being sold today jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer see if i can answer all of those so in the united states our strategy hasn t changed the new line is focused on making rigid products and it will primarily make mid to higher end rigid products because we think we can utilize the full capacity doing that we change the thing that given that it was taking us longer than we hoped and the market was growing faster we changed the strategy in the middle of last year and we began importing more products so that we could satisfy larger parts of the marketplace and going into this year we ve raised our inventory substantially and lvt going into the year to support it and then we ve also announced that we said we re introducing a new pergo brand in that which today has a higher consumer brand than any other thing in the category we haven t sold the first piece of it yet and we re also going to put lvt in the dal tile product offering this year stephen kim evercore isi analyst okay got it that s helpful okay so then my second question relates to inventory i think you mentioned that you re sort of building the stuff that you re making in lvt the new lvt line is going into inventory right now i assume that means that you re going to be looking to launch this pergo product i guess probably in the home centers i m guessing and maybe other places too in 1q i m guessing so could we actually see inventory dollars down as soon as 2q this year and i mean on a year over year basis inventory dollars down or should are we going to have to wait until later this year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer first is that i assume that the chinese have a down period in the first of the year so you have to prebuy ahead of it the second is we are expecting our sales to go up so we re building inventories for those product categories before we have any sales and you have to build enough so that we can satisfy the customers third is the inventory is also going into all these new businesses we go keep talking about when you start them up you put in all the raw materials the inventories and you re building new products before the sales in those two so the inventories were all there frank you want to touch a little bit on where the inventory distribution is at this minute the inventory growth distribution frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance yes like i said in my comments about 70 of the 340 million of growth is in new businesses and acquisitions and the balance here in chinese prebuy or inflation and i think another point to make there is that we worked real hard to take our inventory manufactured inventory levels down by reducing production levels down below the sales levels and i think we ve done a pretty good job of keeping the manufactured inventories down in most categories jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the growth in all these different businesses you have to put the inventories ahead so i don t expect the inventory turns to be what we like them going into the second quarter because it s going to take a while to get all these businesses up even though the inventory is there to support much higher sales stephen kim evercore isi analyst okay so inventory probably won t be down year over year until maybe the back half of the year is kind of what i m hearing is that fair jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes the turns would be the turns right in the inventory stephen kim evercore isi analyst okay so the turns will be up got it in the back half all right thanks very much guys operator your next question is from the line of matt bouley with barclays matt bouley barclays analyst hi thank you for taking my questions jeff could you elaborate on the comment you made there around improving results through the year during 2019 is that a revenue growth or a margin comment are you anticipating i guess the margin declines to lessen just how exactly should we model improving results after the first quarter thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer to start out with the outlook which we said is cautious because of the economies and the housing which we re having difficulty projecting what s going to happen this year but we do expect improvements in the business as we go through with the expansion of the sales and the margins as we go through the year matt bouley barclays analyst okay understood and then secondly does these first quarter guidance anticipate any effect from the tariffs and i m assuming you wouldn t necessarily see an immediate impact but i guess beyond the first quarter obviously as you re sourcing from china how should we think about what the margin impact would look like or what you re planning around that thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t have any idea what additional tariffs will go in and not go in we don t know we haven t built anything into our plan but we ll have to adjust if they go in how we operate and how it impacts the marketplaces matt bouley barclays analyst okay thanks for the detail operator your next question is from the line of john lovallo with bank of america john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi guys thank you for taking my question the first question is just following up on matt s question maybe it looks like the first quarter implied operating margin could kind of be in the 8 5 to 9 range realizing that could be just conservatism on your part but the comments about things getting better or improving i mean should we be thinking about improvement just sequentially or should we be thinking about that on a year over year basis in terms of operating margin frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance we were talking about the year over year margin percentage improving sequentially third quarter fourth quarter john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it all right that s helpful and then if we think about some of the headcount and consolidation that you guys headcount reduction i should say and consolidation of the service centers that you guys talked about i mean clearly it makes a lot of sense from a cost perspective is there any risk though that of negative impact to your operations or was this really just kind of redundant capacity jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer what we did is in some of the major markets we have multiple stores in every corner of the metropolitan areas and we ve developed ways of getting the product to those customers with less store foot service center footprints in the area w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic yes and we don t really see a risk to that because we analyze each market by market and where we took the reductions we should be fine john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks guys operator your next question is from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions the first question i wanted to go back to the discussion around inventory and notwithstanding the uncertainty about whether or not tariffs go into effect at 25 in march just focus specifically at what s played out over the last couple of months you mentioned the chinese prebuy part of that is around the lunar new year part presumably for you guys and also maybe your competitors is really that they re also getting the in out of the tariffs can you just discuss on what you re seeing in terms of both competitor inventory levels and channel inventory levels from your customers in lvt jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i can t speak for my competitors because i have no idea but we are raising the inventories for all the reasons you just went through in some cases we re buying it ahead because of the pricing in some cases we re buying it ahead because of the increases and in some cases we re buying it ahead to expand our business and footprint and brands we re selling under in each cases so it s all of the above i would imagine the rest of the world is doing the same thing mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst and so do you see any potential channel issues in terms of too much inventory in the retail channel as you head into the spring w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i mean i can see what on the ceramic side we tend to build up in preparation for that chinese shutdown but then as you go through the quarter obviously your inventory goes down because you re not buying more from the chinese when they shutdown jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the imports in ceramics which we can see always go up dramatically the first of the year as people are putting in new products changing out old ones and building up their inventories and so what happens is the imports decline as you go through the year and they make adjustments in the second half coming out of it so you typically go in with a more optimistic view and you adjust in the second half of the year and you could see it in the import data mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it okay and then my second question jeff i was hoping if you could give us a little more color around paul s appointment in north america and just what specifically he s already changed out and if there s anything more radical in nature that he s considering as far as strategy there jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i guess a little background on paul paul has been in the industry his whole life he joined our business when we acquired eliane in 2005 at that point he came to the united states and he ran our united states hard surface business for a number of years and then he went back and he s been running the rest of world segment s flooring business since since he got here he s announced changes in the management structure where we ve had a more focused approach on each product category and with that we expect to have greater efficiencies and execution in each category at the same time we re going to enhance these sales synergies across the total segment as we go through and he s a majority of those things needed to be done have already been announced and executed mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you operator your next question is from the line of kathryn thompson with thompson research group kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst hi thank you taking my questions today the first is really more for lvt production more specifically in the us secondarily in europe as you think about tackling the new ceramic or stone type lvt product is this a type of product that you would attempt to manufacture domestically is it still a type of product that you would prefer to import and just really broadly speaking stepping back and looking at the forest for the trees how do you intend to tackle the fast growing different types of products coming out of lvt either manufacturing or more import jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there are two types of stone products one stone product is just changing the stone ceramic looks is just changing the visuals on the various types that are here which we have been doing the other and then there s a new product type that has a different core with it that s being made in china and we have not entered that one yet kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst okay do you is it your intention to get into that product this year or is this something jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer our strategy is to have both a sourced strategy and a manufactured strategy and if the business believes they re better off or they need something to source we won t hesitate to do it kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst okay great my second question just is on flooring north america you gave some great detail in the prepared commentary on some puts and takes on the margins but as we ve had a really two consecutive quarters with pretty steep declines year over year can you help us understand what things are more easily addressable and fixable and what ones will take a little bit longer to rectify so really kind of more inflation things that can catch up but others that are trickier like manufacturing thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean there s some i d say going forward there are different issues so the issues you have with the overall economies and pieces which we can t control which we re not sure exactly how they re going to evolve how we re going to have to react to you have issues in each category like ceramic where the stronger dollar has reduced the pricing in the marketplace the tariffs are raising the prices of the stuff coming out of china and at the same time our freight costs have been going up here which we ve absorbed last year we announced an increase at the end of the fourth quarter to try to recover both some of the margins as well as the freight costs to get them back in each of the different product categories and markets there s different dynamics in each you have on top of that all of these new investments we have are under utilizing the fixed costs because when we go into the new businesses it takes time to ramp them up which is why we said that a large part of these new profitability will be in 2020 and beyond because even if we start them up and get them there we have to get the customers to buy enough to get the profitability that we expect so it will improve through the year but until you hit these rates of utilization that we need in each one you won t be to the potential of what they can have kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst all right thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of susan maklari with credit suisse susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning my first question is just it seems like you did make some significant progress in the quarter in terms of price mix despite some of the macro weakness that we saw can you talk to just a little bit more color around that how sustainable it is and really how we should be thinking about it trending as we move through this year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i guess a few things one is in our carpet business with raw materials we would expect that as the inventories flow through that it will help the margins which should be about the second quarter we should start seeing that however i can say that the oil prices the predictions by people who know more than i do range from about 50 a barrel to 90 and so i have no way of predicting what they re going to be and we ll have to react as they go through the same thing you hear us we talked about in the introductory things about introducing a lot of higher value products in each category about try to driving the premium products and the question is going to be as we go through the thing we think we ll help the mix the question is going to be how the economies and volumes is going to be as we progress through the year and we re sure we ll improve it if we don t have any negative things we re not anticipating show up susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay and then my second question is just as we do think about your source as well as manufacturing strategy can you talk a little bit to the margin differentials with those products and how we should be thinking about the implications of that on the business jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the margin differential in the short term will probably be similar in the longer term we would expect the margins in our manufacturer to be higher susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay so we should be expecting that to come through more in 2020 then jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay all right thank you operator and the next question is from the line of john baugh with stifel john baugh stifel analyst thank you good morning i have two things quickly you gave us some color around production of lvt both in europe and the us was that a rigid comment only or is that all lvt and is there any distinction between the growth rates of the two jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think you asked a production question and a growth question i think let s start with the production piece the production the new lines will actually make either in the united states were primarily focused on well not primarily we re focused on rigid because there s enough volume to use it in europe which hasn t moved as fast we re actually producing significant amounts of flexible because the marketplace isn t moving as fast as rigid as it is here what was the second part john baugh stifel analyst so jeff your focus your production comment in the us about 20 sequential from third quarter was rigid jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer that s on the rigid john baugh stifel analyst that was rigid okay thank you and then secondly the home centers are changing out their floors a little bit on what they re offering could you discuss how that impacted you say last year and how you anticipate it impacting you this year with any focus on timing this year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer actually the timings be a subject ph on the home centers john you re talking about a particular category john baugh stifel analyst well we know they re deemphasizing carpet and to hard surface emphasis and i m just curious as to what you re seeing how that s impacting your business jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer listen they re trying to participate in all the flooring activities like everybody else at the same time they see the trend in lvt like products increasing so they re giving them more space and reducing some of the space in the other ones while they still try to optimize the other product categories and i would say that s probably similar for the entire marketplace w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i know they re also relying on our domestic expertise on the ceramic side and we re doing quite a bit of work with the home centers john baugh stifel analyst great thank you good luck operator your next question is from the line of phil ng with jefferies philip ng jefferies analyst hi guys rest of world flooring was a bright spot for you guys last year but you re seeing market conditions slow down a bit in australia and europe how should we think about growth in that market in 19 and margin step back to wood what drove that w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic well on the particularly on the godfrey hirst we ve integrated godfrey hirst into our organization the australian housing market has weakened as we expected and we re responding we re expanding our commercial carpet tile in that market we re sharing best practices with the united states and we re closing inefficient assets we re also bringing innovative products to the market and expanding our hard surface offering in that market jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the other sales in europe the sales are moderating as the economies are and we still have the highest growth in lvt and laminate we re increasing prices in laminate to offset inflation over there we re increasing our lvt sales with our expanding production we have more sheet vinyl capacity in europe because going forward we won t need it to supply the russian marketplace as we go through and we ve increased the capacity in high end laminate in both countries to allow us to expand those as we get through a lot of it is going to depend on how the economies evolve over there and we re expecting them to be a little slower this year philip ng jefferies analyst got it slower growth but you re still expecting growth at this point is that fair w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic it depends on which products markets and pieces as you go through i mean they re all going to be different philip ng jefferies analyst got it and then just given all the moving pieces you ve called out was raw mats ramping up new capacity jeff i think in the last call you mentioned that flat organic ebitda growth was probably not a bad way to think about 19 there s obviously been some puts and takes is that still a realistic goal or there could be some downside risk to that target at this point jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it depends where the economy is going what s happening i would say there s some downside risk to that given what we see in the housing markets and the general economies philip ng jefferies analyst okay all right thanks a lot appreciate the color operator your next question is from the line of michael rehaut with jpmorgan maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst hi this is actually maggie wellborn on for mike i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about sales mix by like channel and product within your segments during the fourth quarter and specifically did you see any shifts from the third quarter and how do you expect it to play out in the first quarter of 2019 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i guess the biggest shift we saw was from the housing sales slowing down and new and existing home sales in the us marketplace as it slowed down we felt the impact of it other things would be in italy they went into a recession so we saw the same thing we saw compression of the sales and then as things slow down you tend to see more price competition on the other hand in the united states market in some of our categories as we raised prices we saw some of the retailers trading consumers down to try to offset the higher prices in retail so that also created a mix change but i mean all the markets are unique in itself maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay thank you and then just another question you talked about increase in prices i was just wondering what is your level of confidence in your ability to realize those better pricing in the first quarter and into 2019 frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance again it s led by product by country the carpet industry along with our sales increased prices and they seem to be holding through the marketplace as we speak we ve announced an increase in ceramic which was helped by the increases in the tariffs and the large amounts coming in there so we re expecting to be able to get those through as we go through where you go through different markets in ceramic in mexico we ve raised the prices and we re expecting those to hold we are very aggressive in mexico and the lower price points last year because of the new capacity we ve put in and pushing it through the marketplace and on the other extreme you have italy where the volumes going down in the whole industry where there was new capacity put in the marketplace over the last year or so and the margins are being compressed and we re projecting the margins to be lower next year and i mean i don t know in russia we re increasing prices in the russian markets and expanding it the russian market has been a growth area for us and we see it continuing for this year also maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of stephen east with wells fargo stephen east wells fargo analyst thank you and good morning first you ve talked about curtailing production in the fourth quarter and the first quarter as you look at your business now do you expect you ll be curtailing production beyond the first quarter and if so how long do you all think it last at least what you re seeing right now jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we believe we ll be increasing the production rates to match sales going through the year we ve been producing under the sales rate in many of the product categories so the production rate should go up and help us stephen east wells fargo analyst got you okay and then i guess two things on the lvt how long do you think you all are at normal capacity utilization rates for a great type product is this a 19 event that you think you can get to or does that also stretch out into 20 and then just quickly on your guidance for the first quarter if you wouldn t mind just rank ordering what are the biggest issues in your guidance that you gave frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance the lvt we think that by the end of the year we should be operating the new lines at similar productivities and speeds as our older lines having worked through the technical challenges of it so we think going into 2020 we ll have the lines operating at the levels we at the productivity levels we expect and i forgot the second part of the question jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think stephen you were asking about the risk in the first quarter guidance is that what you were asking stephen east wells fargo analyst no just if you wouldn t mind frank just rank ordering the issues in your guidance that s down year over year a bit more than fourth quarter just trying to understand if you would rank order what the biggest drivers of that decline was frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance in the first quarter it would be the economy slowing in most markets it would be housing under pressure in some regions it would be the lower production rates due to the softer environment and it would be the higher price materials slowing through as some of the sales levels were softer in the fourth quarter it takes a little longer for the inventories to flow through stephen east wells fargo analyst okay got you all right thank you operator your next question is from the line of justin speer with zelman associates justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you first question for me just on the capacity utilization in these new plant you mentioned the 20 production speed where is it today and what is fully optimized in your definition jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the plants are running five days a week they re running at much lower speeds than we anticipate them getting to by the end of the year there are more interruptions from software hardware technical things that are being solved one after the other there is training going on with each one so we would expect that the production rates would increase the downtime would decrease dramatically the then you start working on things like the raw material inputs and how you reduce those and you start working on other things of how to improve the product offering with more technical innovations all have to happen as we go through the year we think when we get to the end of the year and go into 20 we ll be in a good position justin speer zelman associates analyst if you were to kind of like pull back and look it like you have a lot coming at you you ve got raw materials coming at you you ve got macro issues you ve got lvt outgrowth issues if you could kind of help if you could help us unpack how much of the revenue and profit in terms of margin drag from inefficiencies that are being expressed in 18 and potentially 19 and where when you get those optimized how much margin improvement you could potentially enjoy as you get those out help us unpack that because i think when you look at raw material i d say that was the bad guy in 18 the other moving pieces how much is just from being suboptimized jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there s multiple parts so one part is the start up costs so the start up costs were about 80 million in 17 and we ve said that start up costs in 18 will be 35 million to 40 million in the start up costs now besides that you have to get the productivity and the volume up and the volume when you get up to 80 85 the costs start dropping dramatically and the profits go up dramatically and then the second part is as you start filling them up you start selling more higher value products and lower value products you have and depending upon the marketplace and what it is the mix can be a big improvement as you go through once these things stabilize so i mean we re at all different places this new plant making countertops in tennessee i mean it s operating one shift now as it one shift as we train the people and go forward it s operating with very basic products and that s totally different than it s going to be next year as we get through so that s extreme on one side in the sheet vinyl plant in russia it s operating on two shifts as it and we re having to go find new customers who never bought sheet vinyl from us and we re doing that so the question on that one is more about the ramp up of it and how fast we can get cuts first ph to move versus technical problems and getting it started up for instance and each one of these is unique and different but it s balancing when you go into new things the good news is you re going at a new products and new geographies which is a big upside but everybody doesn t wake up the next day and say they ll buy everything you can make when you haven t been in the markets before so there s a lot of things that have to get laid out which is why you really have to think of it in long term pieces as they ramp up when they get ramped up and running full they ll all be running at the average of our margins for all of our businesses that s the potential now the question is is it going to happen in six months or two years in each one i can t tell you justin speer zelman associates analyst in view of the lvt kind of stopping and starting is there any change in the economics of that business relative maybe to 6 or 12 months ago you mentioned do you think margins would be better internally produced versus sourced but in a no tariff scenario are the fully landed economics still superior or at least as good as chinese imports jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer that s our plan justin speer zelman associates analyst and lastly the productivity initiatives the mix up and another productivity initiatives you mentioned how should we think about the incremental contributions from those across your business in 2019 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer you have to separate out the new projects from the existing ones and existing one is going to be more determined about the economies and the competition and what it takes to run the assets in the marketplace and we will have to adjust as they are if the markets are good the mix will be better if the markets are bad we ll sell more commodity stuff and the mix will go down so it depends on how the whole markets evolve over time in each product and each country justin speer zelman associates analyst can i sneak one more in lvt as a percentage of revenues where is that in terms of the flooring rest of world and flooring north america frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance well lvt once we have all the plants up and running and fully optimized we ll have manufactured sales in excess of 1 billion and then in addition to that we will continue our sourcing strategy like jeff mentioned earlier justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys operator your next question is from the line of keith hughes with suntrust keith hughes suntrust analyst thank you frank in the prepared comments did you in flooring north america did you say productivity was negative 37 million is that correct frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance i did keith hughes suntrust analyst in this said quarter where it s been pretty notable negative number can you just describe what is going on and what caused that frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance yes it was impacted this quarter again by lower manufacturing levels high employee costs and then ramping up of the new products new capital projects that we ve got going on it s going to continue keith to lag productivity will continue to lag in the first quarter with inefficiencies and higher costs but we are expecting to see improvements as we move through the year in there keith hughes suntrust analyst okay and definitionally in some of the other segments you called out the lower production the lower production volume as a separate item but it s lumped into this number here is that correct in flooring north america frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance no lower volume the margins associated with the standard margins associated with lower margin or volumes are included in the volume number but to the extent you ve got higher unabsorbed overhead for example that s going to show up in productivity keith hughes suntrust analyst okay so the shut you talked about some shutdown numbers that s something different is that correct frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance correct keith hughes suntrust analyst okay is that just plant closures or what is it that number to find out jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer well like in ceramic for example there s no plant closures but you may have lines down keith hughes suntrust analyst okay all right thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of david macgregor with longbow research david macgregor longbow research analyst yes good morning everyone can you just talk about order patterns you maybe seeing in commercial non res markets w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic well at least on the ceramic side where we ve seen the commercial business slowly improve jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer is that we re seeing so far in the first quarter it seems like it s strengthening a little bit for us in all the different markets so we ll have to see how it works david macgregor longbow research analyst is that really with respect to north america or is it jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer that s a north american comment david macgregor longbow research analyst right and is there anything to say about the european non res commercial w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i think we ve seen it at least in italy in ceramic it slowed a little bit than commercial had david macgregor longbow research analyst okay and then what were the most important takeaways for you from the the international surface event trade show frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance which trade show one more time david macgregor longbow research analyst vegas the the international surface event trade show jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer from what we hear from customers is that they are let s say cautiously optimistic really depending on what we see from the housing market david macgregor longbow research analyst all right thanks very much operator your final question comes from the line of lee nalley with suntrust lee nalley suntrust analyst yes thanks for squeezing ph me in just regarding the share repurchases it s not really big for you guys considering your cash flows but the 200 million roughly remaining should we just expect that to be deployed as quickly as possible considering where your stock price is jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we ll continue purchasing it over time and depending upon the market and what s going on we ll act differently lee nalley suntrust analyst okay and then so one follow up just thinking about balancing the repurchases and your leverage i guess how do you have a max target for your leverage or how high would you be willing to take your leverage jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer related to the stock purchase we have approval from the board to buy 500 million is the approval at this point so to do different we would have to go back to the board and get a different piece the leverage in the our total leverage i mean in our history of it not too distant past we ve been comfortable going over 3 times but we want to maintain our ratings with the rating agencies so we can continue to book to borrow money so under the right circumstances and being able to pull the leverage down we would leverage the company up some more lee nalley suntrust analyst okay thanks guys operator and we do have an additional question from the line of christophe van der with value square christophe your line is open christophe van der kelen value square analyst hi good morning thank you very much for taking my question i would like to hear whether you could break out carpet in us hi can you hear me okay great multiple speakers my question would be regarding carpet could you break that out how much there is and how big that is in the us and then also where do you see the carpet market going in the long term because carpet and rugs are somewhat of a declining market so i was wondering how market positioning itself in that market on the longer term and how you see that evolving in the long term thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the carpet category is approximately one third of our total business frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance global business jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer global business and it s been declining over time if you go back a while it was 100 of our business it s now one third we expand into other categories we would expect that the other categories would grow faster over time it would continue to decrease as a proportion of the total are there any other questions christophe van der kelen value square analyst okay and do you expect any further investments or will it really decline or do you expect to just go along jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the investments will be in line with what we think need to be competitive bring new products to the marketplace and increase our efficiencies but i would expect the investments in it to be lower than the other categories christophe van der kelen value square analyst thank you and on ceramics i heard rumors that there are closures in the dal tile stores could you elaborate a bit on that one because i was little bit surprised that i heard rumors that the ceramics market is suffering from the lvt i thought the ceramics would be quite resilient through the entrance of lvt jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer lvt has increased at a rate that s so high that it s impacted the sales of every product category in the flooring industry so they re all they ve all been lowered and lvt is taking 100 of the flooring increase of the entire category on our stores what we said was we ve reduced the number of stores in markets where we had a number of stores and we could maintain the business with lower cost by redistributing the same business to fewer entities and it s enabled us to reduce our sg a costs w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i would add that on the lvt so far it s been primarily as it relates to ceramic a u s phenomenon and countries like mexico brazil russia where labor is a lot less expensive we haven t seen that operator and there are no further questions i will turn the call back over to mr lorberbaum for any closing remarks jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you for joining us we think we re in a good position for the future and have a good day operator this concludes today s earnings conference call you may now disconnect duration 75 minutes call participants frank h boykin chief

business continues to produce stable results as our customers remained resilient despite slowing global economic growth in parts of the world this will remain strong with westernunion com transaction accelerating to 25 growth in the quarter which translated into 22 constant currency revenue increase in addition to ongoing strength in our u s outbound digital business we are also making great progress in increasing westernunion com penetration and growth in key european markets including france the uk and germany for our entire money transfer business revenues increased 1 in constant currency transactions however increased 4 in the fourth quarter and cross border principal volume grew 8 in constant currency terms so underlined metrics are summed ph business solutions showed improvement with revenue s increase in 5 constant currency led by strong growth in europe we again delivered good performance in the payments area of b2b including the education vertical this quarter however we also had good growth in foreign exchange services aided by customer hedging related to increased foreign exchange volatility the bill payments businesses positive mix results with argentina results in u s dollar terms continuing to be heavily impacted by negative currency translation from a profit perspective margins were solid at 19 2 for the quarter and 20 1 for the year as effective cost management and our wu way lean programs contributed to stability operating cash flow for the u s came in as projected as we generated over 800 million and we returned over 740 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends and share repurchases we are also very pleased to announce today a 5 increase in our quarterly dividend raising it to 0 20 per share or 0 80 on an annualized basis as we begin 2019 we remain focused on driving digital expansion and growth offering our cross border platform to new payment areas and generating additional operating efficiencies we made good progress on this initiative in 2018 i mentioned the strong results we experienced with westernunion com which exceeded 0 5 billion in revenue last year our digital expansion efforts to drive future growth also continued to ramp up as we launched approximately 20 new westernunion com or mobile app markets over the last year particularly in asia latin america and the middle east consumer can now access our online or mobile services to initiate transactions in more than 60 countries plus many territories and our digital penetration covers markets that represents approximately 75 of global remittance market principal we believe this will give us additional future revenue growth opportunities for our digital business in addition we embedded digital money transfer services into more third party platforms such as safaricom in kenya and added large principal transfer products for our westernunion com services in the uk we also continue to expand our bank account payout services as you now have the capabilities to send to nearly 100 countries and territories reaching billions of accounts and we are seeing strong growth in account payout transactions the combination of our extensive retail footprint and our growing digital presence and account payout network creates a very strong proposition for consumers providing them the ability to send and receive in whichever method and currency they prefer around the world looking at our progress with new cross border payment opportunities in october we announced our collaboration with amazon in which we utilize our global platform to process international e commerce payments under this agreement amazon customers in various markets will have a new way to pay in person at our retail agent locations over the last few months we have launched pilots for this service in 10 markets mainly in asia and south america coverage in this market is now being increased and we are working with amazon on the expansion roadmap for additional countries in the future turning to our operational efficiency accomplishments the wu way continue to help us run the company better we implemented more than 40 lean deployments last year trained more than 6 000 employees on lean processes and achieved approximately 70 million in run rate savings from wu way driven efficiency programs these savings help fund investment in growth initiative technology and core proficiency such as gdpr in 2019 we will continue to push forward these strategies on a macro level there is uncertainty on economic growth in many parts of the world as well as foreign exchange headwind and geopolitical concerns but we expect stable financial performance in 2019 our business is very diverse with 20 000 corridors and no one no one country outside the u s represent more than 7 of our revenues historically our customers have been resilient even in challenging economic times our transaction and principal trends were how to exit exiting 2018 and we expect that to continue we believe the pricing environment will remain stable and do not expect major pricing changes in 2019 overall our 2019 outlook calls for ph low single digit constant currency revenue growth and operating margin of approximately 20 and continuing strong cash flow generation and return of funds to shareholders but we ll give you more information on the 2019 outlook in a few minutes and right now i would like to turn the call over to him to provide more details on the fourth quarter results raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thank you hikmet as i review 2018 financial results i will focus primarily on the fourth quarter the similar information for the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules fourth quarter revenues of 1 4 billion declined 3 or increased 2 on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period currency translation net of the impact from hedges reduced fourth quarter revenues by approximately 69 million compared to the prior year primarily due to continued declines in the argentine peso the decline in the peso negatively impacted total revenue by 4 percentage points while the effects of inflation on our argentina businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by approximately 2 percentage points and the consumer to consumer segment which represented 80 of company revenues in the quarter revenue declined 1 or increased 1 constant currency while transactions grew 4 total c2c cross border principal increased 5 or 8 on a constant currency basis while principal per transaction was flat or increased 3 constant currency the spread between c2c transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 5 with a negative 2 impact from currency mix had a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points in the quarter while pricing had a negative impact of 1 compared to the prior year period the 1 pricing impact primarily reflects actions taken in the middle east earlier in the year excluding the middle east the net pricing change for the rest of the world was positive both for the quarter and the full year turning to the regional results north america revenue was flat on both a reported and constant currency basis while transactions grew 2 the u s to mexico corridor delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter but this was offset by continued declines in the u s domestic money transfer business in the europe and cis region revenue increased 1 or 2 on a constant currency basis led by france and spain while transactions in the region increased 8 revenue in the middle east africa and south asia region declined 7 on a reported basis or 6 constant currency while transaction growth improved to 3 as the previously avoided ph price reductions are delivering good results and driving volume latin america and caribbean region continue to deliver strong consequently revenue growth driven by argentina ecuador peru and brazil revenue in the region was flat in the quarter or increased 16 constant currency while transactions grew 11 in the apac region revenue declined 9 or 8 constant currency and transactions were down 4 with australia china and new zealand contributing to the decline westernunion com continue to deliver strong growth as revenue grew 21 or 22 constant currency on transaction growth of 25 westernunion com represented 12 of total c2c revenue in the quarter and for the full year business solutions revenues increased 3 or 5 on a constant currency basis and represented 7 of company revenues in the quarter other revenues which consist primarily of our bill payments businesses decreased 11 in the quarter or increased 10 on a constant currency basis and represented 13 of total company revenues pago facil walk in business in argentina continued to grow transactions and local currency revenue aided by inflation but declined in u s dollar terms while our speedpay u s electronic bill payments revenue also declined in the quarter the depreciation of the argentine peso negatively impacted other reported revenue by 21 percentage points in the quarter while argentina inflation is estimated to have positively impacted other reported and constant currency revenues by approximately 11 percentage points turning to the margins and profitability our consolidated gaap results reflect some significant special items primarily in the prior year so i am providing the adjusted metric comparisons to better reflect the fundamentals of the business the adjusted metrics in the current quarter exclude the impact of tax expense related to changes for the accounting of the u s tax act i refer you to our press release tables for a detailed listing of the adjustment item amounts for the prior year quarter and full year the consolidated operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19 3 up from 18 in the prior year on an adjusted basis the adjusted operating margin expansion was driven by lower bad debt marketing and incentive compensation expenses which were partially offset by higher other corporate expenses and technology spending foreign exchange hedges provided a benefit of 4 million in the current quarter compared to a negative impact of 7 million in the prior year period we achieved approximately 10 million of incremental savings from wu way initiatives in the fourth quarter which gave us approximately 45 million of incremental savings for the full year on an absolute basis we achieved approximately 70 million of savings from wu way for the year ebitda margin was 24 2 in the quarter which compared to 22 5 in the prior year period on an adjusted basis the gaap effective tax rate was 9 8 in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis the tax rate was 6 3 compared to 14 3 in the prior year period the decrease in the adjusted tax rate was primarily due to discrete items in the current year period as we previously stated certain of the impacts related to the tax act enacted in december of 2017 we provisionally estimated and additional effects we recorded during each quarter in 2018 in the fourth quarter changes in our estimates related to the tax act resulted in an 8 million tax expense the accounting for the tax act was completed during the fourth quarter so there will not be any additional adjustments going forward adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was 0 49 which compared to 0 41 in the prior year period the increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to the increased operating profit margin a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding partially offset by lower reported revenues the c2c margin was 23 3 which compared to 21 5 in the prior year period the margin increase was driven by lower bad debt marketing and incentive compensation expenses which were partially offset by higher technology spending business solutions operating margin was 5 4 in the quarter compared to negative 3 2 in the prior year period the increase in operating margin was primarily due to high technology and other operating expenses in the fourth quarter of last year business solutions ebitda margin was 16 2 which compared to 8 1 in the prior year period operating margin for the businesses included in other was 1 8 in the quarter which compared to 7 9 in the prior year period the year over year margin decline was primarily due to lower revenue and higher corporate expenses as certain corporate expenses including spending for m a and other strategic action activities are recorded within other turning to our cash flow and balance sheet cash flow from operating activities was 821 million for the full year which includes the negative impact of approximately 200 million related to payments from special items capital expenditures in the quarter were approximately 91 million at the end of the quarter we had cash of 973 million and debt of 3 4 billion we returned 133 million to shareholders in the quarter including 84 million in dividends and 49 million of share repurchases which represented approximately 3 million shares the outstanding share count at quarter end was 441 million shares and we had 544 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires in december of this year turning to our outlook we expect stable financial performance in 2019 despite a slowing global economic environment similar to 2018 we expect a low single digit constant currency revenue increase excluding any benefit related to argentina inflation due to the strength of the dollar against the argentine peso and major european currencies we expect reported revenue growth to be in a range of a low single digit decrease to a low single digit increase operating profit margin is expected to be approximately 20 as we continue to focus on cost efficiencies and lean management implementations to offset investments and some negative impact from foreign exchange we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 17 to 18 in 2019 including negative incremental impact from the u s tax act beat provision we have identified and are in the process of implementing structural actions to mitigate the adverse impact of beat for the future the 2019 rate outlook includes partial benefits from our mitigation efforts as they rolled out during the year we currently expect the effective tax rate in 2020 to be lower in the mid teens level reflecting the full effect of mitigation due to the increase in tax rate this year our 2019 outlook anticipates full year earnings per share to be in a range of 1 83 to 1 95 while cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately 1 billion as we have mentioned previously we are currently considering various strategic alternatives for certain of our business units but do not have anything to announce at this time and there is no assurance any transaction will occur if we were to complete a divestiture during the year our outlook would need to be adjusted to reflect the related revenues and profits that would be removed as well as the impact of any use of proceeds so to summarize we delivered our full year adjusted financial outlook in 2018 and made good progress on key strategic initiatives we continue to generate solid cash flow and return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases in 2019 we expect stable business solid margins and continued strong allocation to shareholders operator we re now ready to take questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question will come from tien tsin huang of jpmorgan tien tsin huang jpmorgan analyst hi good afternoon thanks for all the details so just on i ll start on the dot com business you mentioned acceleration you mentioned new countries i m curious if you have an outlook for 2019 and what is it driven by is it again more country expansion or are you just getting more penetration within your existing countries thanks hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director hi tien tsin good afternoon i think both we will continue to do that because our u s outcome digital business is very strong and these are done by our inaudible existing customers but these are been here for a longer time and as you know we are also in the european union countries longer time with out westernunion com transaction so that s going to continue but we are also very excited finding new customer segments in our new countries and once you launch a country it takes the time with the marketing activities and european ph customers but the growth rates are very promising uk ph in q4 also with a 25 transaction growth which is also very encouraging and we are just starting in middle east and asia with our expansion i think that s really encouraging numbers so that gives us additional channels and still these customers are new to us additional customers doesn t cannibalize our existing business tien tsin huang jpmorgan analyst okay and just my follow up quickly just i wanted to ask on wu way i heard the 70 million in savings but how where are you now in terms of potentially seeing better revenue production from wu way where the investments going maybe just a quick update there hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yes i think we are still very excited about the wu way initiatives i think there s still room from efficiency side also from growth opportunities how we implement that our focus is definitely on digital growth and we do when we launch in a new country we do launch it with wu way initiatives the amazon pay for our platform to amazon the collaboration with amazon was done all by a wu way and that has been launched in 10 countries now and we are just starting to promote that in the 10 countries and there from the efficiency side i still believe there is some room and we gave our guidance about 20 margin for 2019 and while we do this efficiency program we do invest also on the growth that will going to continue to happen and we are wu way is definitely the way we operate raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer and tien tsin on the 70 million that is our full run rate we don t plan to call out any further savings there but we will keep driving for a lean and operating efficiencies and keep reinvesting in the business tien tsin huang jpmorgan analyst understood thank you guys hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you operator the next question will come from bryan keane of deutsche bank bryan keane deutsche bank analyst yes hi guys thanks for taking my questions wanted to ask about the regions in the north america region i see transactions accelerated in the quarter at least year over year from 1 to 2 but constant currency revenues went down a couple points and then eu and cis similar transactions remain the same at about 8 but the constant currency revenues dropped a couple of points just curious what s causing that and is that the mix that you called out there raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yes brian hi this is raj in north america what you re seeing on the revenue side is is it grow over from higher foreign exchange spreads we had in the previous year fourth quarter and some of those spreads were reversed during the course of the year but transaction growth as you mentioned continued to accelerate so that s good our u s outbound business actually did quite well we had 7 transaction growth there which has been accelerating during the course of the year but some of the pricing and mix impacts had the impact that you re referring to and then in europe and cis the dot com business overall grew very well during the course of last year and in the fourth quarter and also our dmt business in france so those had some mix impacts the slowdown in the fourth quarter is again related to higher fx spreads that we had earlier in the year in those markets that we reversed that part of those so transaction trends have been quite healthy and just some of the mix in pricing impacts are having the revenue impact that you re seeing there bryan keane deutsche bank analyst okay got it and then hikmet just thinking about the new opportunities you re talking about for cross border is there a way to quantify that in terms of a revenue opportunity those could produce hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director we don t give that revenue guidance there but i believe there is a new opportunity additional customers like we did with westernunion com these customers like the offering our platforms to third party like safaricom or amazon pay are really new customers that we didn t offer that and that s the only way they can do transactions because if you are in brazil a local currency owner is it in the form card or it is cash you can t do international transactions because you can t use your credit card international credit card there s no international credit card but the people want to buy online want to buy global and pay local and that s really our platform which we developed over years enabled that technology wise compliance wise and settlement wise do that so we are very excited about that and amazon is definitely a partner but there are other also opportunities to expand our platform to new our payments capabilities paying in local buying global it s definitely something we are excited about bryan keane deutsche bank analyst okay great thanks for the color guys hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator and the next question comes from darrin peller of wolfe research darrin peller wolfe research analyst hey guys thank you just when you go into the mix impact hey on the c2c segment that drove the two points of difference between transaction growth and revenue growth and i think you mentioned one point pricing can you just explain a little more around the mix you re talking about and then when we think of 19 outlook just if that s going to persist that kind of a mix impact is going to persist raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah hi darrin the mix is something that we don t really try to forecast it s difficult to forecast it really is related to where the growth is coming from it s mostly geographic mix around the world so what it means optionally is that we re getting faster growth and lower revenue per transaction corridors and that s what you re seeing coming through it varies a little bit this time it was minus 2 and that has to do with product mix but mostly it s a geographic mix issue that s showing up there so it s not something that we try to forecast overall but our revenue outlook envisions whatever might happen there darrin peller wolfe research analyst okay i guess just a higher level question then i mean we re seeing very strong growth of the dot com business continue and to your point accelerate and i guess it just feels like at some point there should be an inflection where it s big enough to more than offset some of the headwinds that you ve seen whether it s on mix or its pricing and potentially something that starts to align more with the volume growth on cross border or even the transaction growth on cross border you re seeing which is higher than revenue when did can you give us a little idea as to when you think that could really start to show and materialize so that the digital side is big enough for you but it offsets other areas raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer well digital or wu com business is it s obviously much larger than it was a few years ago was over 500 million last year but it s still only 12 of consumer revenues so it s going to i don t know when that inflection point is clearly digital we still see very strong growth opportunities retail we think will be a flattish type grower maybe well single digit but we have had negative growth in some of our other areas which is really what s dragging us down wu is accelerated which is good but our bill payments businesses were negative particularly speedpay and so we need to get better overall performance there if we could get to mid single digit type of growth and that gives us good flexibility and what we can do overall so not just digital digital certainly has to be there but other components of our business also have to perform a little bit better than they have been darrin peller wolfe research analyst right so is there anything just i ll leave it there is there anything more you think that s possible to do from a restructuring standpoint beyond those potentially the b2b business we ve talked about maybe it s the sort of domestic money transfer anything else that can be done around restructuring that could help the overall growth profile in more near term manner thanks again guys hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think yes i mean we re are looking constantly about to structural opportunities growth areas and on the efficiency margin part obviously in the retail money transfer business as raj discussed earlier i think it s going to we have a good market there and it s going to be flattish but the growth will come from digital environment then the totally the 12 of our revenue it s the largest by far in the digital money transfer environment and so the countries we rolled out they will come also adding additional customers so i think if you really keep the customers on the retail side and add customers from the digital side our c2c business is quite solid and will drive the growth i think we have to really look at our payments part payments business and on the payments part the volatility last three months helped us in the b2b business but that student pays the payments business c2b business going very well and we are building on that we have to seek some the b and c and the domestic business and speedpay domestic business has been a challenge right and that has an overall impact to our company s performance and the domestic business has been something we are focused not to turn around darrin peller wolfe research analyst okay alright guys thank you hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thanks raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thanks darrin operator and the next question comes from james schneider of goldman sachs james schneider goldman sachs analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my question the latin american region is one that continues to put up very good revenue growth for you i think you talked about the u s outbound mexico in particular can you maybe kind of i ll call out a any other countries or geographies that really contributed to that what initiatives you have going into other countries and then b to what extent that was helped by the addition of wu com in those quarters raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer hey jim this is raj the latin america revenue growth is really the outbound growth from latin america if that s what you re referring to now is driven that we mentioned by argentina ecuador through results so we ve had a quite healthy growth in some of those other markets even though argentina was impacted on a reported basis by the currency devaluation there other markets have been doing quite well in that region so the conditions are quite good we it s a relatively small piece of our overall revenues like ours 9 of total c2c revenues so we ve seen continued good performance there at least on a constant currency basis and in terms of dot com it s certainly a focus that we have in terms of expanding dot com presence in latin america so that s really what we re focused on hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think jim generally c2c business has been stable especially the cross border cities the business is stable latin america as raj said it is a smaller part of our business but we had also strong growth in despite besides u s outbound also in europe uk germany and france have been going very well but we also see now good transaction growth in the middle east as you recall jim last year we implemented some promotions there now they are showing good returns i think that s also a good sign and shows how stable our businesses is so digital growth is definitely driving the top line but there are also very stable number in the retail money transfer business james schneider goldman sachs analyst that s helpful thanks and then maybe as a follow up some of your payments peers have kind of noted a notable slowdown in cross border travel and i understand most of your trends are driven by migration though which are longer term things are you seeing anything in the business as you start q1 that gives you a little bit of pause in terms of a potential macro slowdown and to what extent is that baked into your guidance hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director macro environment is definitely challenging but as you look at our business we are in 200 countries we have 20 000 corridors so we clearly are a portfolio particularly a play in our case right so we do actually don t see big changes on economical environment in the retail money transfer business on the online on our dot com business even strong growth continue to happen the strong growth and q4 exit was very good especially as i mentioned earlier in transaction and in principal amount the brazilian constant currency principal was about 8 growth in q4 and so i think the environment is stable however there is some concerns global concerns on the economical environment james schneider goldman sachs analyst thank you operator next we have a question from james faucette of morgan stanley james faucette morgan stanley analyst thank you very much inaudible wu com and as you are expanding into markets and corridors what are you having to do from a pricing perspective to encourage and attract volumes and how should we think about the pricing opportunities that over time that s my first question raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer hi jim this is raj agrawal when we expand into new markets we really look at the digital business has been new incremental revenues to us so we go into any new market making sure that we price competitively with whatever else might be available in terms of similar service now we have a very unique service offering because the majority of our revenues payout from payout at retail location even though they may be digitally initiated so we do try to price competitively and it doesn t really carry the legacy of the retail business so it s new incremental business to us we price it very competitively we try to get the business and it s really about marketing and acquiring new customers more than anything else in terms of it s not really driven by the pricing we re going to make that a competitive offering and then we just need to tell consumers about the offering james faucette morgan stanley analyst got it and then 2019 outlook you guided to roughly 20 margins 2018 carrying different parts of the year you re a bit above this funnel so can you talk through what would be the puts and takes that would allow you maybe to put back above 20 sequentially in 2019 raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean we comfortable with our 20 margins it could be a little bit above little bit below it just depends on how things play out if you look at the pieces we are investing in the growth opportunities like digital like the relationship we have with amazon we re also investing back in regulatory items like privacy in other areas and then when we are in a low growth environment like we are and we have negative fx impact it s more challenging to get leverage on our cost structure so we do need to get better revenue growth overall to be able to drive better margins which is our objective but for this year we re comfortable with the 20 level james faucette morgan stanley analyst thank you very much raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator the next question comes from jason kupferberg of bank of america merrill lynch jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey thanks good afternoon guys just wanted to start on c2c i know the constant currency revenue growth there i think came in at 1 a little bit below recent trend and the comp is kind of tough in q1 and so i just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the near term trajectory on c2c in constant currency terms raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah again we don t give outlook on a specific business unit jason but we if you just think about the pieces retail business is likely to be a flattish type grower and digital we continue to see good growth opportunities there and it s going to become a bigger and bigger piece so i think the consumer business overall will be solid and stable jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer and wu way is about getting good growth in the other areas that the consumer business should be relatively stable the underlying transaction terms have been good so we ve had some variation due to pricing and mix factors last year in the fourth quarter but overall the underlying metrics have been solid jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then just in terms of sensitivity in 2019 guidance i mean if we just think about some of the macro uncertainties out there hypothetically if there was to be let s say a hard brexit is that would that be a material issue for western union as there been any risk adjustment in the 2019 forecast for that scenario i mean it just seems like it s a decent size remittance market overall so wanted to get your perspective raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah from an operational standpoint we are very well positioned we re ready to operate under a number of different scenarios and you can t predict exactly what the outcome will be economically i don t know exactly what to expect but i would say overall for europe we ve assumed a slightly softer environment but from an operational standpoint we re ready to go regardless of what scenario plays out that s right hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah again we believe that we are prepared we ve been working on that i think operational and customer wise we don t see any issues here and just from the risk side i mean as i mentioned earlier none of our countries are bigger than 7 of our revenue outside the u s so we are operating in 20 000 corridors and i believe that we are very well positioned despite the economical challenges globally we are well positioned to respond and we believe that we are going to have a stable 2019 jason kupferberg bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you for the thoughts raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from ashwin shirvaikar of citi ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst hey guys i guess my question is on operating margin raj you mentioned lower bad debt is this some action you ve taken maybe big data analytics type of stuff what s needing to this can you comment raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer no i would say ashwin that that s really a one off item we have that special items i d say that helped us on the bad debt side but overall from a bad debt standpoint we do a pretty good job of managing some of it is certainly using data analytics but generally we managed the risk in our business quite well and most of our business is on a good funds model so there s not really too much that we have to deal with there so i think we are in a good shape the bad debt was primarily high bad debt expense in the prior year quarter so the comparisons were just favorable ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst got it got it and then the other question with regards to the cross border principal growth i was just kind of wanted to delve a little bit deeper into that what s driving that is it sustainable is it specific geos channels is it any is it reflective of any immigration related concerns people send back money to their home countries anything detail on that hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director i think from general overall business we had a good u s to mexico business is doing well i would say that our principal amount the middle east turning around as i mentioned earlier the transactions growth has been good so it impacts the principal amount also and european business has been stable also as you know we have some issues in the u s domestic money transfer business but that s not the cross border principal and generally the cross border principal has been in a good environment and the market growth has been healthy i think the people are using cross border transfer and thank god they are using western union and going to continue to use western union ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst sounds like geo mix then thanks operator and our next question is from jennifer dugan of suntrust jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi i m on for andrew jeffrey looking at the b2b and other revenue growth both appear very healthy but the margins in both were a bit weaker can you just go into some of the dynamics there raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah the in the b2b business you re looking at the third quarter comparison and margins third quarter to fourth quarter jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yeah raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yes in the b2b business we just benefited in the third quarter from timing of expenses so that was really distributed timing i would say the overall margin for the full year were around 6 for the b2b business or ebitda margin close to 17 which is more representative of the overall margins there and then in the other revenues or other area of our business we did have lower overall revenues in that business but we also had other corporate expenses because certain corporate expenses that are for strategy m a costs fall into the other part of our business we just that s where we record them so that impacted the margins as well jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great and then one other thing i want to talk a little bit more i know you ve mentioned some of the tech investments around digital and some of these opportunities with amazon in addition to some of the regulatory expenses but looking more at the tech investments what is the timeline for some of these investments timeline to getting them done and then the return timeline raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer well the digital investments will be ongoing our strategy there is really to drive growth and expansion all over the world so we re going to it s a continual effort to improve the features and functionality in our platforms we re launching new sites all the time and so that investment will continue for the digital expansion we re also leveraging our platform for new opportunities like the amazon relationship so there is some spending that goes with that so we continue to invest in the technology area and that s really the drive long term growth and expansion and so that s really our strategy hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director i think on sorry i think from also if you are already in a country like u s or europe with the digital which we invested already it s really winning new customer expanding in the marketing wise really making promotions on the digital and if you launch new country there were we do investments and as raj mentioned earlier we want to be in 200 countries like we are in our retail money transfer business we want to be also with our digital business in 200 countries and we are expanding that that s one of our biggest competitive advantages connecting 200 countries with 200 countries and using our payout network in retails with 50 000 locations but also billions of accounts we can drop money really momentarily very fast in accounts directly in more than 100 countries so that investment is going and you could see in the numbers the growth numbers are coming from digital investments jennifer dugan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great thank you hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator the next question comes from ramsey el assal of barclays ben budesheim barclays analyst hi everybody this ben budesheim ph on for ramsey i just had a question on the u s outbound you ve mentioned that has grown quite nicely and accelerated over the course of the year and i guess i m just wondering what s going right is it more digital revenues kind of taking more becoming bigger piece of the whole or taking share or can you kind of parse that out a little bit for us raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah it s a number of things that are going well there there is some pricing and mix impact that s impacting the revenues overall but the transaction growth has been accelerating dot com u s outbound and our digital business has been going very strong and u s to mexico was also very strong and that was being offset by some other things but those two areas have been very strong in our price positioning for u s outbound is very competitive to other offerings and so i would say it s a combination of those two things a cross border wise u s outbound to other countries has been doing quite well for us and there is some impacts on revenues from mix in pricing but otherwise it s the transaction terms and principle terms have been healthy ben budesheim barclays analyst okay great and then just on the tax rate you had mentioned that you expected become down a little bit in 2020 can you give us any sense of like the timing over the course of 2019 will there be some like a step down quarter by quarter or it will be a little more unpredictable any color you can give there would be great raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah we are very pleased with the solution that we re putting in place for the beat issue that came about as part of u s tax reform that was really causing unwarranted double or triple taxation on a portion of our u s outbound business so we are implementing a solution it s going to be implemented during the course of this year i don t have a quarterly tax rate to give you but certainly it s going to be implemented during the course of this year and next year we see our tax rate falling back down to the mid teens level for really the foreseeable future given the current tax environment there we re in so we are very pleased with that outcome ben budesheim barclays analyst thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator and the next question comes from vasundhara goel of kbw vasundhara govil kbw analyst hi thanks for taking my question i guess my first question was on the free cash flow guidance i guess you guys are guiding to slightly better free cash flow even though revenue that are expected to be flattish and margin stable so what s driving that better conversion raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer well in our operating cash flow is for about 1 billion in 2019 and last year in 2018 we had 200 million of special type items that we paid for and that s why the operating cash flow last year was just over 800 million so that s the primary difference overall in the operating cash flow vasundhara govil kbw analyst got it and then in terms of the eps outlook what are you guys including in terms of contribution from share buybacks and more broadly could you talk a little bit about your appetite for m a and how it fits into your capital allocation priorities are you looking at deals actively and if so what type of targets are would you be interested in raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah we don t give a specific amounts for share buyback or the impact eps but if you look at last few years we ve been buying between 400 million and 500 million of stock each year we basically been returning 100 of our free cash flow back to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends and so i expect that we re going to be active again in 2019 and then in terms of m a strategy we re always looking for the right kind of acquisition that fits within our cross border payment strategy we would love to do the right kind of digital type of acquisition but it has to be at the right price and it has to really whatever we do has to advance the ball for us we have a great platform we have great capabilities so whatever we do has to really give us some additional capabilities that fit strategically within our strategy vasundhara govil kbw analyst thank you very much raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator next we have a question from tim willi of wells fargo timothy w willi wells fargo analyst hi thanks and good afternoon a couple of questions on digital and then one on amazon but in terms of thinking about digital and the impact around the margin discussion if i do the math correctly right now it appears that the digital channels is effectively driving all of the revenue growth in c2c would that be correct if i just think about its contribution and its revenue growth rate to digital sort of this all growing channel for c2c while sort of the traditional business you can sort of call it flattish or slightly down is that correct first of all raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah digital is going to be the key growth driver timothy w willi wells fargo analyst okay raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer always for us so we use that in the market long term timothy w willi wells fargo analyst okay so if we think about like at 12 i know that there is always lots of moving pieces around margins and scale and investing and expanding that franchise but is there a way to think it like just conceptually that by the time digital is at 20 or 25 of revenue for that c2c is that a way to think about the inflection point about letting the scale and the growths of digital and that what should be inherently pretty attractive margin start to show through i know you ve always said it s profitable it s just not at the same sort of level so rest of the business but i think you ve always sort of said at some point it should be a higher margin business just any updates on that thought process over the next several years raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean tim it s a great question we are in heavy investment mode in that business if you separate the marketing and technology which is a much heavier concentration than the rest of our business we are spending in marketing technology for the long term growth of this business and so today the margins are lower than the rest of the company and that continues to be the goal until we get broad expansion all around the world with digital but when you look at the contribution margin on a percentage basis and i think we ve mentioned this before the incremental margins are actually similar in both the retail and the digital business and it depends on how much money you re sending in the quarter that s involved but the profitability of a transaction in from a percentage basis is actually quite similar to our retail business so it can be a very profitable business we could drive the profitability up overnight if you wanted to but that s not really the strategy we have it really continues to grow our business to 200 countries and territories and then at some point it will be a better contributor to our overall profitability and especially if we have more account channels account to account capabilities that we re building there that will also help the overall margin profile timothy w willi wells fargo analyst yeah make sense i fully understand it just sort of curious if there s a way we could sort of think about a mile of marker there okay it s a 1 billion of revenue we should really start thinking about digital having a positive upward impact on margins but i can understand there s a lot of to go on between point a to point b when you get there my follow up was just on amazon i think over the years again you guys have struck partnerships and trying to leverage this vast network and your brand and your competencies around cross border and risk management some weighs mixed results some have announced that i don t think necessarily there s been a ton of those follow through i guess we point to you over the years but obviously amazon to amazon so i guess i m just sort of curious when you think about this partnership relative to other agreements that have been struck over to many years how you feel or how this evolution may be different and this potentially could be something where hey this actually has really worked and had an impact it really leverage the brand and the network of western union better than other times hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think we are very excited about this opportunity with bigger with largest global online marketplace right i mean and i think amazon wants to get to new customer segments and really offer their product to the new customer segments and they have the product and using our platform our platform is unique we invested over years and we are very proud of our platform not many companies have licenses to operate in 200 countries and we do have it not many companies can settle in 137 currencies acting 137 currency we have it and that technology that regulatory environment puts us in a unique position to offer our platform to amazon now it s a new product as you know it s nobody did that earlier we are the first doing this in partnership with them we are testing it it s very promising it s a 600 billion market for online shopping and i think that s millions of customers don t have an access on that and we hope that our platform will help amazon to offer their products to new customer segment timothy w willi wells fargo analyst great thanks very much for the time hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thank you raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thanks tim okay laura i will take the final question operator okay the final question will come from bob napoli of william blair bob napoli william blair analyst thank you i appreciate it first question just on the domestic money transfer business and i know that s been a challenge how big is that business now and how much is it declining and do you expect that to continue to decline over the next few years hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah i think as you bob hello how are you bob as you know that s quite challenging business because as a domestic money transfer business there is some pricing pressure and but there are some loyal customers still using that because they want immediate cash at our western union locations payout and these customers are loyal and staying it is about 8 of our c2c business and it s a declining business and but there are some loyal customers who use that sending money online for instance paying immediately in cash it s quite attractive for many customers raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah bob we don t disclose the growth rates on that but it was about 9 of c2c revenues in 2017 so it s down from 9 to 8 bob napoli william blair analyst okay thank you that s helpful then western union is invested in the education vertical i think in payments and you talked about payments hikmet being the healthy business for you can you give an update on the education vertical and what the opportunities are in that business and i think there are some good competitors out there as well hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director yeah there are some competitors up there definitely but it s a great business for us we acquired globally universities and universities are attracting more and more foreign students for instance if i should was going to that in spain for instance there about 200 000 chinese students studying in spain alone that number puts things in perspective there are millions of millions of students going abroad and studying and they want to pay their tuition local currency and study abroad in their universities and we enable that now we are in few countries with our student pay we met mostly and unless asian ph countries but also we are expanding our university acquisition constantly to offer the product to the new segments i m particularly excited about the future of the western union once we build this c2b abilities we could do that also besides universities also to other verticals i think that gives us a unique position to do the cross border payments for many needs of many customers because we can handle 137 currencies bob napoli william blair analyst can you give us any feel for the size and growth rate of that business hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director we don t particularly break that business but the main growth on the b2b this quarter we had a good also trading business but main growth of the b2b comes from the payments part of the business and it s something that very good raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer yeah just within b2b about half of the business comes from what we can refer to it payments and half of it comes from the basic apec services education vertical is one of the businesses within payments but we don t disclose specific size bob napoli william blair analyst great thank you appreciate it raj agrawal executive vice president chief financial officer thanks hikmet ersek president chief executive officer director thanks bob mike salop senior vice president of investor relations thanks everyone for joining us today and wish you a

commenting on macron s taxing policy former world bank economist says he transforms public wealth into private wealth and shifts it upwards by slashing taxes for the rich and imposing new taxes on poor and middle class citizens reducing pensions unemployment health benefits etc peter koenig believes the move by the yellow vests is an opportunity for change which can indeed be spread to other countries in europe and the united states peter koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst he worked for over 30 years with the world bank and the world health organization around the world also he lectures at universities in the us europe and south america he is also a co author of the world order and revolution below is the full text of the interview q the protesting yellow vests want macron out of elysee how has macron turned to a figure intensely disliked by so many of his own people a the french were disgusted by president françois hollande emmanuel macron s predecessor hollande was nominally a socialist but he had no backbone and sold france out to neoliberalism actually hollande was the epitome of the non distinction of parties i e no matter what the party color the overarching ruling force throughout the western world had become neoliberalism in many cases bordering on neo fascism france was a case in point and was well prepared for what was to follow up came the new king macron who had no party and still has no party but a movement called en marche meaning more or less let s move forward from 2014 to 2016 macron was minister of economy and finance a period during which he prepared the very unpopular new labor law under which eventually workers might lose most of their accumulated labor rights could be hired and fired by industry without hardly any protection the law was finally implemented during macron s first year in office previously from 2008 coincidentally the year when the man made financial crisis began to 2012 macron was a successful investment banker at rothschild bank where he learned the ropes of international finance debt restructuring and in fact debt enslaving in hindsight it is clear that he was prepared for the presidency by the rothschild clan and the elite that is behind it campaigning from about mid 2016 to the 2017 elections he was propped up by the banking funded media he promised a new government of the people and for the people with his new movement en marche with the help of false flags i e the 14th july 2016 french national holiday massacre in nice he promised more security a permanent emergency law akin to martial law if he became president after this and previous false flags in paris people screamed for more security from terrorism largely unaware that it was state terrorism and with the help of internet facebook cambridge analytica propaganda campaign roi macron was elected in the second round on 7 may 2017 with according to the going democratic system a decisive margin but in fact with less than 25 of the eligible french electorate soon after his election victory he turned around disregarded his pre election promises which is not unusual for politicians in general but what distinguished macron from others he displayed an abject arrogance almost an outright disrespect or even disgust for the common people whom he promised to govern for started slashing taxes for the rich and imposing new taxes on poor and middle class citizens reducing pensions unemployment and health benefits and so on eventually the new so called eco gasoline tax was just about the legendary drop that brought the barrel to overflow and macron s popularity dropped to below 18 macron eventually rescinded the new fuel tax and other taxes as well as increased the minimum wage by 100 per month with an apologetic face which was clearly fake a gesture too little too late on public television plus in his televised speech he did not mention with one word the new most unpopular labor law he put through parliament where his movement has an absolute majority withdrawing that unpopular law may have just given macron the credit he missed and still misses but his capitalist backers would of course not allow such a profit infringing concession today the yellow vests and much of the french people want nothing less than macron s resignation q how do these unrests affect the economy a there are two sides of economics the one for the protesters and the french people per se is that they are unhappy with the continuous deterioration of the purchasing power of french wages and hard earned social benefits they require an outright reversal of the upward shift of capital from the working class to the elite a trend that is clearly visible not only in france but also in most other western countries especially the us if the yellow vests succeed that might mean an economic upheaval perhaps an economic revolution that could spread to other countries in europe and possibly beyond i trust that the french yellow vests are well aware of this and that their protests are calls for change way beyond the french borders and in fact it already shows as protests have started perhaps under other pretexts in hungary belgium the netherlands romania etc in germany chancellor merkel s days are counted who and what will follow her there is a tremendous social discontent in germany for reasons not much different from the ones in france falling purchasing power increasing poverty a large proportion of the german population mostly women works part time and many of them especially single mothers need at least two jobs to survive they escape the unemployment statistics the capital controlled media will not report and inform the people of the truth lying has been their bread and butter and this doesn t likely change unless the system changes this might mean exit from the euro and exit from the eu i e frexit the macro economic benefit for the country would be tremendous of course as with brexit the tremendous benefits for the people will not be reported either by the mainstream media because it would be a slap in the face of unfettered neoliberal capitalism to the contrary people are intimidated with threats of a looming disaster if their countries would break loose from the already defunct european union it would mean going back to the roots of economics i e basically re vamp the economy by local production for local markets with a local currency and a public banking system that works for the french people for the french economy and not for the shareholders in far away countries i e wall street and large european private banks people would be motivated to work for their country and their well being thereby boosting the local economy and local well being if greece would have taken this step in 2008 to 2009 when the man made crisis hit with a grexit so to speak greece would today be well recovering would be a prosperous country with a recovered social system and most particularly without a strangulating debt on the other hand if things stay the way they are now with macron s few half hearted concessions the cost to the french economy is estimated at about 8 to 10 billion euros who will pay for them this is the question as long as macron stays in power nothing will significantly change for the rich as he will not reverse the tax system they put him in the presidency so he transforms public wealth into private wealth and shifts it upwards this means the funds have to be found stolen somewhere like for example in the former french colonies which are still heavily under the yoke of the french central bank they cannot control their own reserves as their economies are hamstrung by the french economy a little known fact in other words if the situation stays as it is no radical breakthrough by the yellow vests the situation for the french economy may be worse or rather the official version will blame the protesters while the extra money is most likely being squeezed from the poor possibly in the former french colonies in one way or another q how do you see the future can such crisis be spread to other countries in the european union or even the us will that leave any room for transatlantic relations a the future is unpredictable indeed a clear case of dynamics how do the people and how do politicians react and how does this interaction between different interest groups affect the overall outcome you call it crisis i call it an opportunity yes the opportunity for change can indeed be spread to other countries in europe and why not to the united states some signs as i mentioned before are already on the horizon of course the controlling power the neoliberal everything goes capitalism will not just cave in they have too much at stake but there are also other forces playing along simultaneously for example asia is becoming stronger by the day with china s xi jinping s new silk road or belt and road initiative bri well under way since 2013 and gradually engulfing and covering eurasia and europe with a new way of trade transport infrastructure build up and a new economic system the global equation will be changed and changed for the better of the people in this sense macron is just a little boy a little king in a small country as compared to a large and long term movement towards a more equal global but multi polar economy if the yellow vests see beyond their own french interests if they see the big picture of a new economy which is already shaping up in the east they may be a valuable contributor and accelerator for change

executive officer jeff jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you frank after five consecutive years of record earnings 2018 proved more difficult than we anticipated with inflation increasing dramatically luxury vinyl tile impacting other us flooring products and most of our markets slowing in this environment we selectively invested approximately 1 5 billion to enhance our long term performance primarily in new product categories and geographies with greenfield projects and acquisitions cost saving initiatives and buying back shares our industry has faced periods with volatile costs and shifts in consumer preferences before and we have always navigated through them to emerge stronger and a more competitive position and 2018 inflation in the us was primarily driven by increasing material costs escalating transportation and energy costs and constrained chemical supply the tight us labor market increased employee turnover which impacted both efficiencies and training costs our ability to offset these pressures was hindered by continuous inflation more competitive imports due to a stronger dollar and substitution of lvt for other alternatives in the us lvt is taking share from other flooring and it will become a significantly larger part of our portfolio our lvt manufacturing and import strategies are progressing and our margins will improve in the future in the us and europe we are adding more talent to our lvt operations to increase our production efficiency and differentiation in 2019 while we are managing through these conditions we are enhancing the long term value of our business in 2018 we acquired leading flooring companies in australia new zealand and brazil and in europe two flooring distributors and a specialized mezzanine company we entered the european porcelain slab and carpet tile markets we expanded our higher quality ceramic in eastern europe and initiated sheet vinyl production in russia and quartz countertop manufacturing in the united states much of the benefit from these capital investments will be realized in 2020 and beyond as we achieve higher volume mix and productivity turning to the fourth quarter results we generated sales of 2 4 billion up 3 as reported or 5 on a constant currency for the period our adjusted operating income was 241 million or 10 of sales with an adjusted eps of 2 53 as with our first year performance as with our full year performance the period was affected by significant inflation slowing markets and lvt impacting sales of other products even as we executed price increases in many products our business has experienced increased competition and greater pressures on pricing and mix in the period inflation continued to be a headwind across most categories as higher materials flowed through our costs we decreased our manufacturing production in the fourth quarter to adapt to market demand our start up costs in the period were higher than we projected with lvt production improving slower than anticipated our new countertop and sheet vinyl plants initiated manufacturing and our polish ceramic tile expansion was still starting up in the period we purchased about 274 million of mohawk stock reducing our share count by 2 3 million or the equivalent of 3 of our outstanding shares for more details on our segments i ll now turn the call

continuing to do so in the first period we are increasing our commercial sales force to boost sales of our premium technical ceramic in retail we are expanding our high end collections in unique thin wall tile products we are gaining traction with our large porcelain slabs which can be used for floors walls and countertops with the expansion of our european ceramic footprint we are increasing the

separate sales force specifically for these lower priced collections we anticipate introducing a patented easy insulation tile in europe later this year with these actions we expect to increase the utilization of our european assets as we move through the year the russian ceramic market has grown as the economy improved during the period our sales and profitability increased substantially

cost and improve processes in the us market lvt sales continued to increase impacting the purchase of other flooring in november we announced paul de cock s appointment as president of the flooring

propositions both our residential and commercial lvt sales grew substantially during the period as we implemented our sourcing and manufacturing strategy we are offering a premium pergo lvt collection which before introducing has great consumer brand recognition than any other lvt product in the market though we had anticipated even more improvement the speed of our lvt production increased about 20 over the prior period we re adding more engineering resources to further increase productivity formulations and yields long term we are confident that our investment in this technology will provide us with competitive advantages when it is operating at expected levels our flooring rest of world segment delivered fourth quarter sales of 614 million an increase of 12 as reported or 16 on a constant currency basis with acquisitions enhancing our results adjusted margin for the segment was 13 of sales including start up cost of 18 million as we progressed through the period we experienced

laminate price increases to recover rising costs and currency changes our investments to expand laminate production in europe and russia have increased our market share by delivering differentiated visuals and waterproof features the new lines also supported margin expansion with improved mix and greater efficiencies the expanded production is enabling us to increase our sales in russia which has been constrained by capacity limitations our lvt sales continue to grow dramatically as our production rates increase some of our lvt introductions were postponed until later this period as we overcame technical problems that increased our costs during the fourth quarter we have seen about 15 speed improvements in lvt over the last quarter as our processes have been refined and we anticipate continued improvement in the year ahead the improved performance of the new line will allow us to add unique visuals and performance features to our collections in europe we are gaining

experienced sales and margin pressures we have implemented initiatives to increase sales and focus on value added products we re expanding the mezzanine flooring business we acquired last year as we leverage our existing manufacturing and sales organization now i ll pass the call to frank who will review our fourth quarter financial performance frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance thank you chris net sales for the quarter were 2 449 million and grew 3 as reported with the legacy business up almost 1 on a constant exchange rate basis flooring rest of world had the strongest growth with lvt and laminate products performing well both in rest of world and in our north american segment just as a heads up in 2019 the first quarter will have one additional day and then will have one less day in the fourth quarter of 2019 gross margin as reported was 26 4 or 27 1 excluding charges and was down from 32 3 last year inflation of 61 million lower productivity of 24 million higher start up of 17 million plant shutdowns of 15 million and unfavorable foreign exchange of 13 million offset increased volume of 18 million and price mix of 9 million sg a as reported was 17 7 or excluding charges 17 3 compared to 17 1 last year we had unusual charges of 27 million that primarily were related to the godfrey hirst and eliane acquisitions and plant consolidation in north america our operating margin excluding charges was 9 8 down from 15 1 last year inflation headwinds of 62 million along with the impact of increased start up of 18 million shutdown of 15 million and lower productivity of 23 million offset 9 million of improvement in price mix we also had a 7 million headwind from fx ebitda was 381 million in the fourth quarter and 1 7 billion for the full year our interest expense for the quarter was 14 million which compares to 7 million last year the increase was related to early extinguishment of high cost eliane debt our income tax rate improved to 19 2 from 27 2 last year due to the 2017 tax reform act we estimate a first quarter rate of approximately 22 5 to 23 5 and a full year rate of 22 to 23 for 2019 earnings per share excluding charges were 2 53 which was a decrease of 26 compared to last year turning to the segments our global ceramic segment had sales of 861 million fourth quarter sales increased 5 as reported with our legacy business up 2 on a constant exchange rate basis our russian business reported the highest growth and north america improved sequentially on a year over year basis in the quarter operating income excluding charges was 87 million with a margin of 10 1 down from 14 last year inflation of 30 million declining price mix of 6 million and increased shutdown costs of 8 million offset incremental productivity of 13 million and stronger overall volume in the flooring north america segment sales of 974 million decreased year over year by 3 with improvement in price mix of 26 million which was offset by volume weakness in soft surface product lines our operating income excluding charges in this segment was 86 million with a margin of 8 9 compared to 16 7 last year improvement in price mix of 20 million was offset by inflation of 36 million unfavorable productivity of 37 million and 7 million of production shutdowns as well as start up of 7 million we also had 17 million of lower volume in the flooring rest of world segment sales were 614 million an increase of 12 as reported with our legacy sales growing 3 on a constant exchange rate basis lvt had the strongest growth in this category operating income excluding charges was 78 million with the margin of 12 8 compared to 15 8 last year productivity and lower material costs were offset by 5 million of foreign exchange and another 5 million of lower price mix as well as higher start up of 13 million in the corporate and eliminations segments we had an operating loss of 11 million and in 2019 we are estimating a loss ranging between 35 million and 40 million jumping to the balance sheet receivables ended the quarter at 1 606 million with our days sales outstanding at 60 days in the quarter compared to 59 days a year ago inventories ended the quarter at 2 288 million with inventory days at 128 our inventory was up 340 million from the fourth quarter of last year with 70 of the increase from new businesses and acquisitions and 30 of the increase from chinese pre buy and inflation we lowered our legacy manufactured inventory in most categories as we ran production below sales during the quarter our fixed assets for the quarter ended up at 4 7 billion and included capital expenditures of 151 million with depreciation and amortization of 139 million for the full year capital expenditures were 794 million with depreciation and amortization of 522 million we are estimating capex for 2019 to be approximately 550 million to 580 million with depreciation and amortization estimated at 560 million looking at long term debt our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong total debt was 3 3 billion at the end of the quarter with leverage at 1 8 times debt to ebitda jeff i ll turn it back over to you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you frank as we enter 2019 many macroeconomic conditions around the world could impact our results economies have been slowing in most of our markets oil volatility is making our costs unpredictable and the housing markets in many regions are under pressure so our outlook is cautious because of these issues we expect our results to improve through the year in the first quarter we re reducing production rates due to softer environment in most of our markets higher price materials will flow through before we realize the benefits from recent changes the dollar strengthened relative to last year and will have a significant negative impact on the first period we continue to introduce innovative new collections implement price increases and improved manufacturing processes taking all of this into account our eps guidance for the first quarter of 2019 is 2 02 to 2 12 excluding any onetime charges our major product and geographic expansions are at various stages of ramping up as we progress through the year these investments will increase our sales and margins price increases will benefit our results our start up costs will decline and production levels will increase we will realize the potential of these projects in 2020 and beyond as volume and efficiencies increase today the business is strong with substantial resources a broader product portfolio and a more diverse geographic footprint we have a strong balance sheet extensive liquidity and historically low debt leverage in the short term we are taking the appropriate steps to manage through these market uncertainties and we are confident our investments and acquisitions will significantly enhance our long term business we ll now be glad to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question i was hoping you could shed some light on general industry dynamics in the us ceramics market with the 10 ebit margins you recorded which are going lower in the first part of 2019 i guess even if we say you re tracking above that because of the investment headwinds and destocking that are hurting results temporarily where do you think the competitors are from a profitability standpoint and where that marginal production cost is i m trying to understand that given your scale advantages at what point do you start to see the competitors alleviate some pressures that you re seeing on the price cost side jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the competitors we believe are already reducing their production rate significantly in the us market however about 50 or more of the us capacity is satisfied by worldwide supply base and is imported at the same time you have the 10 increase in tariffs from china which is the biggest supplier of imports to the country so you have a lot of dynamics going on we are raising our prices as we speak to recover some of the freight and margin loss we ve incurred so far michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay and then as a follow up you talked about deteriorating slowing sales in many markets can you just give us an update on what market you seemed stabilized since at the start of this year and what markets are continuing to slow down jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the so we see in europe the markets slowing across we have a large part of our sales in italy which is going into a recession and we have the russian market is improving in russia the mexican market decreased in 2018 it was running at double digits in our category in 2017 in 18 it was running negative we think a lot of it was caused by the interactions between the us and them but we see it improving in the us your guess on what s going to happen with the economy and housing is as good as mine this year michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you good luck operator your next question is from the line of stephen kim with evercore isi stephen kim evercore isi analyst thanks very much guys first question is about your lvt production and how or whether your plans have evolved since you started building the two major lines a couple of years ago the two new lines like for instance i m wondering is your intention to focus to new dalton line on like high end rigid lvt and source the rest whereas maybe previously you intended to produce both high end low end rigid or maybe you re planning to do flexible lvt on that line for the time being or is it basically just that your plan is essentially unchanged just merely delayed so whatever you can share about your thinking and how it may have evolved will be great an as for the rigid product you are currently making where is this product being sold today jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer see if i can answer all of those so in the united states our strategy hasn t changed the new line is focused on making rigid products and it will primarily make mid to higher end rigid products because we think we can utilize the full capacity doing that we change the thing that given that it was taking us longer than we hoped and the market was growing faster we changed the strategy in the middle of last year and we began importing more products so that we could satisfy larger parts of the marketplace and going into this year we ve raised our inventory substantially and lvt going into the year to support it and then we ve also announced that we said we re introducing a new pergo brand in that which today has a higher consumer brand than any other thing in the category we haven t sold the first piece of it yet and we re also going to put lvt in the dal tile product offering this year stephen kim evercore isi analyst okay got it that s helpful okay so then my second question relates to inventory i think you mentioned that you re sort of building the stuff that you re making in lvt the new lvt line is going into inventory right now i assume that means that you re going to be looking to launch this pergo product i guess probably in the home centers i m guessing and maybe other places too in 1q i m guessing so could we actually see inventory dollars down as soon as 2q this year and i mean on a year over year basis inventory dollars down or should are we going to have to wait until later this year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer first is that i assume that the chinese have a down period in the first of the year so you have to prebuy ahead of it the second is we are expecting our sales to go up so we re building inventories for those product categories before we have any sales and you have to build enough so that we can satisfy the customers third is the inventory is also going into all these new businesses we go keep talking about when you start them up you put in all the raw materials the inventories and you re building new products before the sales in those two so the inventories were all there frank you want to touch a little bit on where the inventory distribution is at this minute the inventory growth distribution frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance yes like i said in my comments about 70 of the 340 million of growth is in new businesses and acquisitions and the balance here in chinese prebuy or inflation and i think another point to make there is that we worked real hard to take our inventory manufactured inventory levels down by reducing production levels down below the sales levels and i think we ve done a pretty good job of keeping the manufactured inventories down in most categories jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the growth in all these different businesses you have to put the inventories ahead so i don t expect the inventory turns to be what we like them going into the second quarter because it s going to take a while to get all these businesses up even though the inventory is there to support much higher sales stephen kim evercore isi analyst okay so inventory probably won t be down year over year until maybe the back half of the year is kind of what i m hearing is that fair jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes the turns would be the turns right in the inventory stephen kim evercore isi analyst okay so the turns will be up got it in the back half all right thanks very much guys operator your next question is from the line of matt bouley with barclays matt bouley barclays analyst hi thank you for taking my questions jeff could you elaborate on the comment you made there around improving results through the year during 2019 is that a revenue growth or a margin comment are you anticipating i guess the margin declines to lessen just how exactly should we model improving results after the first quarter thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer to start out with the outlook which we said is cautious because of the economies and the housing which we re having difficulty projecting what s going to happen this year but we do expect improvements in the business as we go through with the expansion of the sales and the margins as we go through the year matt bouley barclays analyst okay understood and then secondly does these first quarter guidance anticipate any effect from the tariffs and i m assuming you wouldn t necessarily see an immediate impact but i guess beyond the first quarter obviously as you re sourcing from china how should we think about what the margin impact would look like or what you re planning around that thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t have any idea what additional tariffs will go in and not go in we don t know we haven t built anything into our plan but we ll have to adjust if they go in how we operate and how it impacts the marketplaces matt bouley barclays analyst okay thanks for the detail operator your next question is from the line of john lovallo with bank of america john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi guys thank you for taking my question the first question is just following up on matt s question maybe it looks like the first quarter implied operating margin could kind of be in the 8 5 to 9 range realizing that could be just conservatism on your part but the comments about things getting better or improving i mean should we be thinking about improvement just sequentially or should we be thinking about that on a year over year basis in terms of operating margin frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance we were talking about the year over year margin percentage improving sequentially third quarter fourth quarter john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it all right that s helpful and then if we think about some of the headcount and consolidation that you guys headcount reduction i should say and consolidation of the service centers that you guys talked about i mean clearly it makes a lot of sense from a cost perspective is there any risk though that of negative impact to your operations or was this really just kind of redundant capacity jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer what we did is in some of the major markets we have multiple stores in every corner of the metropolitan areas and we ve developed ways of getting the product to those customers with less store foot service center footprints in the area w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic yes and we don t really see a risk to that because we analyze each market by market and where we took the reductions we should be fine john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks guys operator your next question is from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions the first question i wanted to go back to the discussion around inventory and notwithstanding the uncertainty about whether or not tariffs go into effect at 25 in march just focus specifically at what s played out over the last couple of months you mentioned the chinese prebuy part of that is around the lunar new year part presumably for you guys and also maybe your competitors is really that they re also getting the in out of the tariffs can you just discuss on what you re seeing in terms of both competitor inventory levels and channel inventory levels from your customers in lvt jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i can t speak for my competitors because i have no idea but we are raising the inventories for all the reasons you just went through in some cases we re buying it ahead because of the pricing in some cases we re buying it ahead because of the increases and in some cases we re buying it ahead to expand our business and footprint and brands we re selling under in each cases so it s all of the above i would imagine the rest of the world is doing the same thing mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst and so do you see any potential channel issues in terms of too much inventory in the retail channel as you head into the spring w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i mean i can see what on the ceramic side we tend to build up in preparation for that chinese shutdown but then as you go through the quarter obviously your inventory goes down because you re not buying more from the chinese when they shutdown jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the imports in ceramics which we can see always go up dramatically the first of the year as people are putting in new products changing out old ones and building up their inventories and so what happens is the imports decline as you go through the year and they make adjustments in the second half coming out of it so you typically go in with a more optimistic view and you adjust in the second half of the year and you could see it in the import data mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it okay and then my second question jeff i was hoping if you could give us a little more color around paul s appointment in north america and just what specifically he s already changed out and if there s anything more radical in nature that he s considering as far as strategy there jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i guess a little background on paul paul has been in the industry his whole life he joined our business when we acquired eliane in 2005 at that point he came to the united states and he ran our united states hard surface business for a number of years and then he went back and he s been running the rest of world segment s flooring business since since he got here he s announced changes in the management structure where we ve had a more focused approach on each product category and with that we expect to have greater efficiencies and execution in each category at the same time we re going to enhance these sales synergies across the total segment as we go through and he s a majority of those things needed to be done have already been announced and executed mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you operator your next question is from the line of kathryn thompson with thompson research group kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst hi thank you taking my questions today the first is really more for lvt production more specifically in the us secondarily in europe as you think about tackling the new ceramic or stone type lvt product is this a type of product that you would attempt to manufacture domestically is it still a type of product that you would prefer to import and just really broadly speaking stepping back and looking at the forest for the trees how do you intend to tackle the fast growing different types of products coming out of lvt either manufacturing or more import jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there are two types of stone products one stone product is just changing the stone ceramic looks is just changing the visuals on the various types that are here which we have been doing the other and then there s a new product type that has a different core with it that s being made in china and we have not entered that one yet kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst okay do you is it your intention to get into that product this year or is this something jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer our strategy is to have both a sourced strategy and a manufactured strategy and if the business believes they re better off or they need something to source we won t hesitate to do it kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst okay great my second question just is on flooring north america you gave some great detail in the prepared commentary on some puts and takes on the margins but as we ve had a really two consecutive quarters with pretty steep declines year over year can you help us understand what things are more easily addressable and fixable and what ones will take a little bit longer to rectify so really kind of more inflation things that can catch up but others that are trickier like manufacturing thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean there s some i d say going forward there are different issues so the issues you have with the overall economies and pieces which we can t control which we re not sure exactly how they re going to evolve how we re going to have to react to you have issues in each category like ceramic where the stronger dollar has reduced the pricing in the marketplace the tariffs are raising the prices of the stuff coming out of china and at the same time our freight costs have been going up here which we ve absorbed last year we announced an increase at the end of the fourth quarter to try to recover both some of the margins as well as the freight costs to get them back in each of the different product categories and markets there s different dynamics in each you have on top of that all of these new investments we have are under utilizing the fixed costs because when we go into the new businesses it takes time to ramp them up which is why we said that a large part of these new profitability will be in 2020 and beyond because even if we start them up and get them there we have to get the customers to buy enough to get the profitability that we expect so it will improve through the year but until you hit these rates of utilization that we need in each one you won t be to the potential of what they can have kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst all right thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of susan maklari with credit suisse susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning my first question is just it seems like you did make some significant progress in the quarter in terms of price mix despite some of the macro weakness that we saw can you talk to just a little bit more color around that how sustainable it is and really how we should be thinking about it trending as we move through this year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i guess a few things one is in our carpet business with raw materials we would expect that as the inventories flow through that it will help the margins which should be about the second quarter we should start seeing that however i can say that the oil prices the predictions by people who know more than i do range from about 50 a barrel to 90 and so i have no way of predicting what they re going to be and we ll have to react as they go through the same thing you hear us we talked about in the introductory things about introducing a lot of higher value products in each category about try to driving the premium products and the question is going to be as we go through the thing we think we ll help the mix the question is going to be how the economies and volumes is going to be as we progress through the year and we re sure we ll improve it if we don t have any negative things we re not anticipating show up susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay and then my second question is just as we do think about your source as well as manufacturing strategy can you talk a little bit to the margin differentials with those products and how we should be thinking about the implications of that on the business jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the margin differential in the short term will probably be similar in the longer term we would expect the margins in our manufacturer to be higher susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay so we should be expecting that to come through more in 2020 then jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer yes susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay all right thank you operator and the next question is from the line of john baugh with stifel john baugh stifel analyst thank you good morning i have two things quickly you gave us some color around production of lvt both in europe and the us was that a rigid comment only or is that all lvt and is there any distinction between the growth rates of the two jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think you asked a production question and a growth question i think let s start with the production piece the production the new lines will actually make either in the united states were primarily focused on well not primarily we re focused on rigid because there s enough volume to use it in europe which hasn t moved as fast we re actually producing significant amounts of flexible because the marketplace isn t moving as fast as rigid as it is here what was the second part john baugh stifel analyst so jeff your focus your production comment in the us about 20 sequential from third quarter was rigid jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer that s on the rigid john baugh stifel analyst that was rigid okay thank you and then secondly the home centers are changing out their floors a little bit on what they re offering could you discuss how that impacted you say last year and how you anticipate it impacting you this year with any focus on timing this year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer actually the timings be a subject ph on the home centers john you re talking about a particular category john baugh stifel analyst well we know they re deemphasizing carpet and to hard surface emphasis and i m just curious as to what you re seeing how that s impacting your business jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer listen they re trying to participate in all the flooring activities like everybody else at the same time they see the trend in lvt like products increasing so they re giving them more space and reducing some of the space in the other ones while they still try to optimize the other product categories and i would say that s probably similar for the entire marketplace w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i know they re also relying on our domestic expertise on the ceramic side and we re doing quite a bit of work with the home centers john baugh stifel analyst great thank you good luck operator your next question is from the line of phil ng with jefferies philip ng jefferies analyst hi guys rest of world flooring was a bright spot for you guys last year but you re seeing market conditions slow down a bit in australia and europe how should we think about growth in that market in 19 and margin step back to wood what drove that w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic well on the particularly on the godfrey hirst we ve integrated godfrey hirst into our organization the australian housing market has weakened as we expected and we re responding we re expanding our commercial carpet tile in that market we re sharing best practices with the united states and we re closing inefficient assets we re also bringing innovative products to the market and expanding our hard surface offering in that market jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the other sales in europe the sales are moderating as the economies are and we still have the highest growth in lvt and laminate we re increasing prices in laminate to offset inflation over there we re increasing our lvt sales with our expanding production we have more sheet vinyl capacity in europe because going forward we won t need it to supply the russian marketplace as we go through and we ve increased the capacity in high end laminate in both countries to allow us to expand those as we get through a lot of it is going to depend on how the economies evolve over there and we re expecting them to be a little slower this year philip ng jefferies analyst got it slower growth but you re still expecting growth at this point is that fair w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic it depends on which products markets and pieces as you go through i mean they re all going to be different philip ng jefferies analyst got it and then just given all the moving pieces you ve called out was raw mats ramping up new capacity jeff i think in the last call you mentioned that flat organic ebitda growth was probably not a bad way to think about 19 there s obviously been some puts and takes is that still a realistic goal or there could be some downside risk to that target at this point jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it depends where the economy is going what s happening i would say there s some downside risk to that given what we see in the housing markets and the general economies philip ng jefferies analyst okay all right thanks a lot appreciate the color operator your next question is from the line of michael rehaut with jpmorgan maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst hi this is actually maggie wellborn on for mike i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about sales mix by like channel and product within your segments during the fourth quarter and specifically did you see any shifts from the third quarter and how do you expect it to play out in the first quarter of 2019 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i guess the biggest shift we saw was from the housing sales slowing down and new and existing home sales in the us marketplace as it slowed down we felt the impact of it other things would be in italy they went into a recession so we saw the same thing we saw compression of the sales and then as things slow down you tend to see more price competition on the other hand in the united states market in some of our categories as we raised prices we saw some of the retailers trading consumers down to try to offset the higher prices in retail so that also created a mix change but i mean all the markets are unique in itself maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay thank you and then just another question you talked about increase in prices i was just wondering what is your level of confidence in your ability to realize those better pricing in the first quarter and into 2019 frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance again it s led by product by country the carpet industry along with our sales increased prices and they seem to be holding through the marketplace as we speak we ve announced an increase in ceramic which was helped by the increases in the tariffs and the large amounts coming in there so we re expecting to be able to get those through as we go through where you go through different markets in ceramic in mexico we ve raised the prices and we re expecting those to hold we are very aggressive in mexico and the lower price points last year because of the new capacity we ve put in and pushing it through the marketplace and on the other extreme you have italy where the volumes going down in the whole industry where there was new capacity put in the marketplace over the last year or so and the margins are being compressed and we re projecting the margins to be lower next year and i mean i don t know in russia we re increasing prices in the russian markets and expanding it the russian market has been a growth area for us and we see it continuing for this year also maggie wellborn jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of stephen east with wells fargo stephen east wells fargo analyst thank you and good morning first you ve talked about curtailing production in the fourth quarter and the first quarter as you look at your business now do you expect you ll be curtailing production beyond the first quarter and if so how long do you all think it last at least what you re seeing right now jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we believe we ll be increasing the production rates to match sales going through the year we ve been producing under the sales rate in many of the product categories so the production rate should go up and help us stephen east wells fargo analyst got you okay and then i guess two things on the lvt how long do you think you all are at normal capacity utilization rates for a great type product is this a 19 event that you think you can get to or does that also stretch out into 20 and then just quickly on your guidance for the first quarter if you wouldn t mind just rank ordering what are the biggest issues in your guidance that you gave frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance the lvt we think that by the end of the year we should be operating the new lines at similar productivities and speeds as our older lines having worked through the technical challenges of it so we think going into 2020 we ll have the lines operating at the levels we at the productivity levels we expect and i forgot the second part of the question jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think stephen you were asking about the risk in the first quarter guidance is that what you were asking stephen east wells fargo analyst no just if you wouldn t mind frank just rank ordering the issues in your guidance that s down year over year a bit more than fourth quarter just trying to understand if you would rank order what the biggest drivers of that decline was frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance in the first quarter it would be the economy slowing in most markets it would be housing under pressure in some regions it would be the lower production rates due to the softer environment and it would be the higher price materials slowing through as some of the sales levels were softer in the fourth quarter it takes a little longer for the inventories to flow through stephen east wells fargo analyst okay got you all right thank you operator your next question is from the line of justin speer with zelman associates justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you first question for me just on the capacity utilization in these new plant you mentioned the 20 production speed where is it today and what is fully optimized in your definition jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the plants are running five days a week they re running at much lower speeds than we anticipate them getting to by the end of the year there are more interruptions from software hardware technical things that are being solved one after the other there is training going on with each one so we would expect that the production rates would increase the downtime would decrease dramatically the then you start working on things like the raw material inputs and how you reduce those and you start working on other things of how to improve the product offering with more technical innovations all have to happen as we go through the year we think when we get to the end of the year and go into 20 we ll be in a good position justin speer zelman associates analyst if you were to kind of like pull back and look it like you have a lot coming at you you ve got raw materials coming at you you ve got macro issues you ve got lvt outgrowth issues if you could kind of help if you could help us unpack how much of the revenue and profit in terms of margin drag from inefficiencies that are being expressed in 18 and potentially 19 and where when you get those optimized how much margin improvement you could potentially enjoy as you get those out help us unpack that because i think when you look at raw material i d say that was the bad guy in 18 the other moving pieces how much is just from being suboptimized jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there s multiple parts so one part is the start up costs so the start up costs were about 80 million in 17 and we ve said that start up costs in 18 will be 35 million to 40 million in the start up costs now besides that you have to get the productivity and the volume up and the volume when you get up to 80 85 the costs start dropping dramatically and the profits go up dramatically and then the second part is as you start filling them up you start selling more higher value products and lower value products you have and depending upon the marketplace and what it is the mix can be a big improvement as you go through once these things stabilize so i mean we re at all different places this new plant making countertops in tennessee i mean it s operating one shift now as it one shift as we train the people and go forward it s operating with very basic products and that s totally different than it s going to be next year as we get through so that s extreme on one side in the sheet vinyl plant in russia it s operating on two shifts as it and we re having to go find new customers who never bought sheet vinyl from us and we re doing that so the question on that one is more about the ramp up of it and how fast we can get cuts first ph to move versus technical problems and getting it started up for instance and each one of these is unique and different but it s balancing when you go into new things the good news is you re going at a new products and new geographies which is a big upside but everybody doesn t wake up the next day and say they ll buy everything you can make when you haven t been in the markets before so there s a lot of things that have to get laid out which is why you really have to think of it in long term pieces as they ramp up when they get ramped up and running full they ll all be running at the average of our margins for all of our businesses that s the potential now the question is is it going to happen in six months or two years in each one i can t tell you justin speer zelman associates analyst in view of the lvt kind of stopping and starting is there any change in the economics of that business relative maybe to 6 or 12 months ago you mentioned do you think margins would be better internally produced versus sourced but in a no tariff scenario are the fully landed economics still superior or at least as good as chinese imports jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer that s our plan justin speer zelman associates analyst and lastly the productivity initiatives the mix up and another productivity initiatives you mentioned how should we think about the incremental contributions from those across your business in 2019 jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer you have to separate out the new projects from the existing ones and existing one is going to be more determined about the economies and the competition and what it takes to run the assets in the marketplace and we will have to adjust as they are if the markets are good the mix will be better if the markets are bad we ll sell more commodity stuff and the mix will go down so it depends on how the whole markets evolve over time in each product and each country justin speer zelman associates analyst can i sneak one more in lvt as a percentage of revenues where is that in terms of the flooring rest of world and flooring north america frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance well lvt once we have all the plants up and running and fully optimized we ll have manufactured sales in excess of 1 billion and then in addition to that we will continue our sourcing strategy like jeff mentioned earlier justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys operator your next question is from the line of keith hughes with suntrust keith hughes suntrust analyst thank you frank in the prepared comments did you in flooring north america did you say productivity was negative 37 million is that correct frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance i did keith hughes suntrust analyst in this said quarter where it s been pretty notable negative number can you just describe what is going on and what caused that frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance yes it was impacted this quarter again by lower manufacturing levels high employee costs and then ramping up of the new products new capital projects that we ve got going on it s going to continue keith to lag productivity will continue to lag in the first quarter with inefficiencies and higher costs but we are expecting to see improvements as we move through the year in there keith hughes suntrust analyst okay and definitionally in some of the other segments you called out the lower production the lower production volume as a separate item but it s lumped into this number here is that correct in flooring north america frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance no lower volume the margins associated with the standard margins associated with lower margin or volumes are included in the volume number but to the extent you ve got higher unabsorbed overhead for example that s going to show up in productivity keith hughes suntrust analyst okay so the shut you talked about some shutdown numbers that s something different is that correct frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance correct keith hughes suntrust analyst okay is that just plant closures or what is it that number to find out jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer well like in ceramic for example there s no plant closures but you may have lines down keith hughes suntrust analyst okay all right thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of david macgregor with longbow research david macgregor longbow research analyst yes good morning everyone can you just talk about order patterns you maybe seeing in commercial non res markets w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic well at least on the ceramic side where we ve seen the commercial business slowly improve jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer is that we re seeing so far in the first quarter it seems like it s strengthening a little bit for us in all the different markets so we ll have to see how it works david macgregor longbow research analyst is that really with respect to north america or is it jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer that s a north american comment david macgregor longbow research analyst right and is there anything to say about the european non res commercial w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i think we ve seen it at least in italy in ceramic it slowed a little bit than commercial had david macgregor longbow research analyst okay and then what were the most important takeaways for you from the the international surface event trade show frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance which trade show one more time david macgregor longbow research analyst vegas the the international surface event trade show jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer from what we hear from customers is that they are let s say cautiously optimistic really depending on what we see from the housing market david macgregor longbow research analyst all right thanks very much operator your final question comes from the line of lee nalley with suntrust lee nalley suntrust analyst yes thanks for squeezing ph me in just regarding the share repurchases it s not really big for you guys considering your cash flows but the 200 million roughly remaining should we just expect that to be deployed as quickly as possible considering where your stock price is jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we ll continue purchasing it over time and depending upon the market and what s going on we ll act differently lee nalley suntrust analyst okay and then so one follow up just thinking about balancing the repurchases and your leverage i guess how do you have a max target for your leverage or how high would you be willing to take your leverage jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer related to the stock purchase we have approval from the board to buy 500 million is the approval at this point so to do different we would have to go back to the board and get a different piece the leverage in the our total leverage i mean in our history of it not too distant past we ve been comfortable going over 3 times but we want to maintain our ratings with the rating agencies so we can continue to book to borrow money so under the right circumstances and being able to pull the leverage down we would leverage the company up some more lee nalley suntrust analyst okay thanks guys operator and we do have an additional question from the line of christophe van der with value square christophe your line is open christophe van der kelen value square analyst hi good morning thank you very much for taking my question i would like to hear whether you could break out carpet in us hi can you hear me okay great multiple speakers my question would be regarding carpet could you break that out how much there is and how big that is in the us and then also where do you see the carpet market going in the long term because carpet and rugs are somewhat of a declining market so i was wondering how market positioning itself in that market on the longer term and how you see that evolving in the long term thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the carpet category is approximately one third of our total business frank h boykin chief financial officer and vice president finance global business jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer global business and it s been declining over time if you go back a while it was 100 of our business it s now one third we expand into other categories we would expect that the other categories would grow faster over time it would continue to decrease as a proportion of the total are there any other questions christophe van der kelen value square analyst okay and do you expect any further investments or will it really decline or do you expect to just go along jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the investments will be in line with what we think need to be competitive bring new products to the marketplace and increase our efficiencies but i would expect the investments in it to be lower than the other categories christophe van der kelen value square analyst thank you and on ceramics i heard rumors that there are closures in the dal tile stores could you elaborate a bit on that one because i was little bit surprised that i heard rumors that the ceramics market is suffering from the lvt i thought the ceramics would be quite resilient through the entrance of lvt jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer lvt has increased at a rate that s so high that it s impacted the sales of every product category in the flooring industry so they re all they ve all been lowered and lvt is taking 100 of the flooring increase of the entire category on our stores what we said was we ve reduced the number of stores in markets where we had a number of stores and we could maintain the business with lower cost by redistributing the same business to fewer entities and it s enabled us to reduce our sg a costs w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer president global ceramic i would add that on the lvt so far it s been primarily as it relates to ceramic a u s phenomenon and countries like mexico brazil russia where labor is a lot less expensive we haven t seen that operator and there are no further questions i will turn the call back over to mr lorberbaum for any closing remarks jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you for joining us we think we re in a good position for the future and have a good day operator this concludes today s earnings conference call you may now disconnect duration 75 minutes call participants frank h boykin chief

nothing is completely off the table when it comes to talks with the us but labour mp ian murray a leading campaigner for the pro second eu referendum group people s vote said these plans would effectively turn britain into an economic colony of the united states and must be resisted here huffpost uk has compiled a list of just 30 us lobbyist demands made to the office of the united states trade representative 1 scrap the safety first approach to food quality and standards juan ricardo luciano is chairman of adm a multi billion food and commodities trading corporation based in chicago joshua roberts reuters firms want us negotiators to force britain to ditch the precautionary principle when it comes to food safety standards multiple submissions to the us government s consultation demanded advertisement lobbyists for the north america export grain association and national grain and feed association for example said the eu s inappropriate use of the precautionary principle when addressing regulatory measures is a challenge they added that the two groups view a trade agreement with the uk as an opportunity for us negotiators to seek the resolution of several non tariff trade barriers stemming from the eu s protectionist use of precaution that have plagued us eu bilateral trade 2 weaken data protection for consumers mark zuckerberg has so far refused to give evidence to a uk commons committee over the facebook cambridge analytica data breach reuters britain has strict regulations which protect the privacy of data and stop it from being sold to third parties adopting the eu wide gdpr general data protection regulation rules last year made companies more accountable for data protection a move that is credited with giving people more control over their data advertisement but in their submission the american property casualty insurance association said it was made clear some firms see uk data rules as a barrier it reads us insurers have noted that compliance with data regulations in the uk particularly with regard to the eu s general data protection regulation gdpr is overly burdensome we suggest that the uk us negotiations be used to reduce that burden 3 allow the sale of hormone riddled beef sipa usa pa images unlike in the us many hormones are banned in the uk as they are deemed harmful the national cattleman s beef association have demanded that us standards be recognised in britain in a move which could pave the way for hormone riddled meats being sold to british consumers they asked for mutual recognition of equivalence in safety standards in their submission 4 slash british cattle farming subsidies darren staples reuters advertisement the national cattleman s beef association also spelled out exactly what the us farming industry wants from a uk us trade deal an to beef subsidies in the uk british farmers are heavily reliant on government cash so this would threaten to put them out of business us beef farming

genetically modified foods are labelled in the us has been the subject of numerous protests lucy nicholson reuters advertisement as it stands any new genetically modified crop sold in the uk must be rigorously tested and will be clearly labelled but the national grain and feed association called these regulations onerous and wants negotiators to work with their uk counterparts to address these biotech related regulatory oversight policies so as to maximise bilateral trade flows of products derived from deployment of safe crop production technologies and minimise regulatory risk for us exporters 6 stop people knowing what they re eating is genetically modified food margouillatphotos via getty images the uk has a mandatory labelling scheme for genetically modified food so people are informed about what they are eating the national confectioners association which advocates for the 35bn us confectionary industry and whose motto is always a treat wants to see it scrapped

images britain s chemical market operates using the eu s precautionary principle it means the uk takes a safety first approach to regulation and guards against letting anything into the market which could be dangerous but the society of chemical manufacturers which represents over 150 firms involved in the 300bn us chemical industry told trump to target this in trade talks its submission says in short the us regulatory system utilises a risk based analysis while the eu system incorporates a precautionary hazard classification system an integrated risk based approach would greatly reduce regulatory burdens on specialty chemical manufacturers many of whom are small and medium sized enterprises advertisement 8 bin protections for traditional british products pa archive pa images lots of us lobbyists want negotiators to pressure britain to scrap protections for british produce which regulate how they re marketed the geographical indicator regulation currently guaranteed under eu law

images where it would not necessarily be protected the eu and uk is currently pursuing laws which would prevent data from being transferred across borders to other countries where regulation differs wildly however the us tech sector wants a new rule which would override any such law in a uk us trade deal bsa the software alliance says the deal should obligate the parties to permit the cross border transfer of data and prohibit data localisation requirements advertisement 12 allow politicians not courts to handle legal disputes sipa usa pa images a group of american unions is demanding all disputes relating to the us uk trade deal shall be settled by state to state arbitration so by politicians not judges the afl cio group s ask would vastly restrict the ability of individuals and companies to seek remedies and would mean governments rather than independent legal experts make binding rulings on whether the terms of the trade deal have been observed 13 allow foreign businesses to sue the british state klenger via getty images a separate investor state dispute settlement scheme has also been suggested for a us uk trade deal this one suggested by the powerful security industry and financial markets association would allow multinational companies to sue the britain over regulations or interventions the state makes in the country s or citizens interests advertisement a crucial difference of this scheme would mean cases would not be heard in the british courts but in arbitration courts which are not subject to domestic law in a recent case in a similar scheme the australian government was sued under a similar mechanism for trying to remove branding from cigarettes for example the association told the consultation the most effective dispute settlement mechanism for investors is investor state arbitration a uk us agreement should include such a mechanism and ensure it extends to financial services to enable investors to bring their claims on a depoliticised basis and seek damages for breaches of the obligations 14 stop britain holding big social media companies to account tnrsmr via getty images concerns have been growing over the role social media has played not only in damaging young people s mental health but a huge range of issues plaguing modern life including a resurgence of sexism racism and harassment advertisement debate continues to rage over how best to regulate social media firms like facebook or twitter but the us tech lobby wants trump to curb whatever route the uk eventually chooses the computing technology industry association says negotiators should ensure the uk does not adopt measures that would impose liability as a publisher creator or speaker of information on third party distributors or intermediaries of that information this would prevent the british government from trying to hold tech firms to account for what they publish after any us uk trade deal 15 end rules that let british shoppers know what colourings are in their food stefanie sansotetra eyeem via getty images us confectionary firms want to see regulation rolled back so they don t have to make uk shoppers know what colourings are in

biggest problems the globe faces in 2018 with concern rising that doctors will find infections more difficult to treat if the drug stops working nhs chiefs have warned antibiotic use in farm animals threatens human health and britain and the eu are close to bringing in regulation restricting its use but the national pork producers council wants trump to guarantee the uk does not regulate so it can sell antibiotic filled meat to uk customers it says us negotiators should ensure that the proposed eu legislation is not imposed by the united kingdom after its withdrawal from the eu and not applied to imports of us pork products advertisement 18 eliminate uk testing for a parasitic worm in pork trichinae are parasitic roundworms sometimes found in pigs which if digested by humans can cause serious health problems because of this it is law that all british and eu pork must be tested for trichinae but the national pork producers council have told the us government it should make the

the old continent is dying the euro is on the brink of collapse this is what you can often hear in the press but is that really the case we invite you to read our today s article about the development of the eurozone in the last twenty years and find out what are the real prospect of the euro and what does it imply for the gold market 20 year of eurozone and gold in december we celebrated 40 years of market reforms in china in january there was another important anniversary 20 years of the euro area so let s move from east asia to europe analyzing the economic situation of the eurozone and its implications for gold after years of negotiations and preparations the eurowas launched on january 1st 1999 initially the shared currency was only virtual and the national currencies were still legal tenders used in circulation for ordinary citizens little changed however the exchange rates between national currencies were locked at fixed rates against each other while the european central bank took control over their monetary policy the euro notes and coins entered the circulation three years later the first members included austria belgium finland france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain greece joined the club in 2001 thought it should not have done as it turned out later since then seven more countries slovenia cyprus malta slovakia estonia latvia lithuania entered the eurozone at the beginning everything was running smoothly but then the financial crisis hit the eurozone heavily revealing significant defects in its architecture the fatal flaw is that there is a currency union with the several independent fiscal policies it was quite perverse as the great recession erupted in america however the us with its unified fiscal and political system overcame the crisis relatively quickly on the contrary the eurozone suffered a prolonged depression as the financial crisis morphed into the sovereign debt crisis only when mario draghi famously pledged the ecb would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro the market turmoil calmed the truth is that the europe s monetary union is still unfinished as there is neither a true banking union nor a capital market union this is because the euro was the political project from the beginning not an economic one it was never an optimal currency area but the idea was that the euro would push european countries toward deeper integration making wars impossible as economists we are thus a bit skeptical of the prospects of the common currency and the whole bloc indeed as the chart below shows the eurozone performed worse than the us the former economy grew 31 4 percent by q3 2018 compared to 50 5 percent for the latter chart 1 real gdp growth in the eurozone blue line and in the us red line from q1 1999 to q3 2018 as an index where q1 1999 100 however the pace of growth was also lower than in the us before the introduction of the euro and the common currency did not prevent the whole bloc from growing although the performance differed among the countries actually the euro s performance has been demonized its performance has not been as poor as one could expect given the moderate growth in the gdp and all those gloomy headlines just look at the chart below which presents the eur usd exchange rate since the creation of the euro chart 2 eur usd exchange rate from january 1999 to december 2018 as one can see the euro s value against the us dollar was initially 1 1812 from then to the end of 2018 it dropped to 1 1456 or 3 percent not so bad given that fact that it is used in several economically distinct countries what are the implications for the gold market quite important as it turns out please look at the chart above once again although the correlation is not perfect it s clear that the performance of euro which is the second widely used reserve currency in the world is significantly linked to the gold prices it s true that the eurozone faces many problems including still weak banking system or the rise in populism but investors should acknowledge that the euro area is more robust today than it was at the start of the greek sovereign debt crisis for example the european policy makers established the rescue fund and launched the banking union moreover despite the populist revolution almost 75 percent of the eurozone s population support the euro even in italy almost 70 percent supports the common currency and funny enough when the risk premium increased italy s new government also started to express more sympathy towards the euro all this means that the euro is out of the danger zone at least in the short run actually the slowdown of the u s and china s expansion could push investors towards the euro denominated assets especially when the ecb starts finally hiking its interest rates if that happens and the euro strengthens against the us dollar in the second half of 2019 the price of gold may go up

s consultation demanded lobbyists for the north america export grain association and national grain and feed association for example said the eu s inappropriate use of the precautionary principle when

evidence to a uk commons committee over the facebook cambridge analytica data breach reuters britain has strict regulations which protect the privacy of data and stop it from being sold to third parties adopting the eu wide gdpr general data protection regulation rules last year made companies more accountable for data protection a move that is credited with giving people more control over their data but in their submission the american property casualty insurance association said it was made clear some firms see uk data rules as a barrier advertisement it reads us insurers have noted that compliance with data regulations in the uk particularly with regard to the eu s general data protection regulation gdpr is overly burdensome we suggest that the uk us negotiations be used to reduce that burden 3 allow the sale of hormone riddled beef sipa usa pa images unlike in the us many hormones are banned in the uk as they are deemed harmful the national cattleman s beef association have demanded that us standards be recognised in britain in a move which could pave the way for hormone riddled meats being sold to british consumers they asked for mutual recognition of equivalence in safety standards in their submission 4 slash british cattle farming subsidies darren staples reuters advertisement the national cattleman s beef association also spelled out exactly what the us farming industry wants from a uk us trade deal an to beef subsidies in the uk british farmers are heavily reliant on government cash so this would threaten to put them out of business us beef farming

regulation how genetically modified foods are labelled in the us has been the subject of numerous protests lucy nicholson reuters as it stands any new genetically modified crop sold in the uk must be rigorously tested and will be clearly labelled but the national grain and feed association called these regulations onerous and wants negotiators to work with their uk counterparts to address these biotech related regulatory oversight policies so as to maximise bilateral trade flows of products derived from deployment of safe crop production technologies and minimise regulatory risk for us

images advertisement britain s chemical market operates using the eu s precautionary principle it means the uk takes a safety first approach to regulation and guards against letting anything into the market which could be dangerous but the society of chemical manufacturers which represents over 150 firms involved in the 300bn us chemical industry told trump to target this in trade talks its submission says in short the us regulatory system utilises a risk based analysis while the eu system incorporates a precautionary hazard classification system an integrated risk based approach would greatly reduce regulatory burdens on specialty chemical manufacturers many of whom are small and medium sized enterprises 8 bin protections for traditional british products pa archive pa images advertisement lots of us lobbyists want negotiators to pressure britain to scrap protections for british produce which regulate how they re marketed the geographical indicator regulation currently guaranteed under eu law stops much loved products like stilton and cornish pasties being imitated by american firms or indeed anyone so it s easy to see why us industry would want rid of it the

such as rigid cost effectiveness methodologies should not be the principle framework for assessing value 10 ignore the presence hormones and pus in dairy products donomacs via getty images advertisement your eyes do not deceive you pus and hormones hormone treated milk is common in the us but banned in the uk bst hormone can cause unnecessary suffering to cows and lead to significant amounts of pus finding its way into their milk but the national milk producers federation and the us dairy export council want uk regulations to mirror america s so us dairy products can be sold here the main objective in a us uk trade agreement should be a truly mutual and comprehensive recognition of our dairy safety systems the nmpf said 11 ensure brits data can be transferred to foreign countries metamorworks via getty images advertisement where it would not necessarily be protected the eu and uk is currently pursuing laws which would prevent data from being transferred across borders to other countries where regulation differs wildly however the us tech sector wants a new rule which would override any such law in a uk us trade deal bsa the software alliance says the deal

of american unions is demanding all disputes relating to the us uk trade deal shall be settled by state to state arbitration so by politicians not judges advertisement the afl cio group s ask would vastly restrict the ability of individuals and companies to seek remedies and would mean governments rather than independent legal experts make binding rulings on whether the terms of the trade deal have been observed 13 allow foreign businesses to sue the british state klenger via getty images a separate investor state dispute settlement scheme has also been suggested for a us uk trade deal this one suggested by the powerful security industry and financial markets association would allow multinational companies to sue the britain over regulations or interventions the state makes in the country s or citizens interests a crucial difference of this scheme would mean cases would not be heard in the british courts but in arbitration courts which are not subject to domestic law advertisement in a recent case in a similar scheme the australian government was sued under a similar mechanism for trying to remove branding from cigarettes for example the association told the consultation the most effective dispute settlement mechanism for investors is investor state arbitration a uk us agreement should include such a mechanism and ensure it extends to financial services to enable investors to bring their claims on a depoliticised basis and seek damages for breaches of the obligations 14 stop britain holding big social media companies to account tnrsmr via getty images concerns have been growing over the role social media has played not only in damaging young people s mental health but a huge range of issues plaguing modern life including a resurgence of sexism racism and harassment advertisement debate continues to rage over how best to regulate social media firms like facebook or twitter but the us tech lobby wants trump to curb whatever route the uk eventually chooses the computing technology industry association says negotiators should ensure the uk does not adopt measures that would impose liability as a publisher creator or speaker of information on third party distributors or intermediaries of that information this would prevent the british government from trying to hold tech firms to account for what they publish after any us uk trade deal 15 end rules that let british shoppers know what colourings are in their food stefanie sansotetra eyeem via getty images advertisement us confectionary firms want to see regulation rolled back so they don t have to make uk shoppers know what colourings are in foods this would risk preventing shoppers knowing whether they are buying sweets and chocolate containing chemicals and e

antibiotic resistance the world health organisation has cited it as one of the biggest problems the globe faces in 2018 with concern rising that doctors will find infections more difficult to treat if

legislation is not imposed by the united kingdom after its withdrawal from the eu and not applied to imports of us pork products 18 eliminate uk testing for a parasitic worm in pork advertisement trichinae are parasitic roundworms sometimes found in pigs which if digested by humans can cause serious health problems because of this it is law that all british and eu pork must be tested for

advertisement british law states that meat for consumption cannot be washed with with antimicrobial products including chlorine or bleach environment secretary michael gove has ruled out a post brexit britain importing this kind of meat due to public health concerns but us lobbyists will push the president to ask the national pork producers council says the regulation adds significantly to the cost of exporting pork to the uk and the uk pathogen reduction treatment ban should be eliminated through the us uk free trade deal negotiations 20 legalise dangerous pesticides michael meijer via getty images advertisement many food pesticides sprayed on us crops are deemed too dangerous in europe neonicotinoid pesticides for example are thought to pose risks to bees so are currently banned while widely used in america the us grains council thinks the uk has to change its outlook to fit more closely with american rules it told the consultation regulation of pesticides has the potential to negatively impact future us grains exports to the eu it added the uk needs to establish its own independent policies and regulations on crop protection products to help address these issues the council would advocate strongly for inclusion of the provisions of the sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures included in into a us uk agreement advertisement 21 let fruit and veg be sold with pesticide residue on nigel farage eating fruit pa wire pa images strict limits are imposed on how much pesticide residue can be on fruit and vegetables by the time they reach supermarket shelves in the uk but the american pistachio growers think this is a bad idea and a potential barrier to the easy flow of trade it told the consultation we strongly urge our us negotiators to include this sanitary and phytosanitary issue as a major trade objective and to persuade the uk to diverge from the eu s maximum residue level mrl policy towards a transparent mrl standard setting policy with the us advertisement 22 allow more carcinogens in pistachios aniko hobel via getty images the american pistachio growers want uk law to change so that products rejected for containing carcinogenic aflatoxins can be reconditioned and put back in to the uk market it adds additionally the us pistachio industry is seeking the ability for us pistachio product found to exceed uk aflatoxin limits in the uk to be reconditioned so it may be brought into compliance 23 loosen regulation on direct selling drafter123 via getty images advertisement direct selling or multi level marketing is associated with unscrupulous companies though not illegal it is tightly regulated in the uk amway is an american company which specialises in this model of marketing to push health beauty and home care products to people in their homes and workplaces its distributors or as it calls them independent business owners market products directly to people and can sponsor and mentor others to become independent business owners it has been investigated by the federal trade commission and various countries to see if it is a pyramid scheme though has not been found guilty advertisement amway wants trump to ensure safeguards on direct selling are lifted in the uk it says we request that the us government ask the united kingdom to accept language in the services chapter of a new trade agreement that will recognise the legitimacy of direct selling 24 a big shift on the definition of standards sipa usa pa images the libertarian lobby group americans for prosperity founded by the koch brothers wants the uk to accept all products made in the us to lower standards it wants trump to guarantee the uk accepts all of the us standards and regulations using one mutual recognition clause in any uk us deal advertisement 25 scrap the amazon tax jetcityimage via getty images chancellor philip hammond is exploring how the uk can tax big online businesses like google and amazon more fairly such as via data storage and processing the drive for a so called amazon tax has followed a decade of austerity and stands in sharp contrast to gargantuan profits of online firms many of whom are accused of paying poverty wages and offering poor working conditions to staff advertisement the us council for international business disagrees big firms should pay more it says other key digital priorities for a us uk agreement include prohibitions on data storage and data processing taxes as well as prohibitions on applying taxation measures in a way that discriminates against digital services or is not technologically neutral 26 more toxic substances in glass that will be near food losinstantes via getty images lead and cadmium are poisonous substances which is why the uk regulates the amount in glassware intended for contact with food in america they aren t so careful firms look only at how much these poisons leech into food rather than how much of them are present advertisement massachusetts glass company libbey incoporated prefers the less safe approach it says in particular both the us and eu regulate the amount of lead and cadmium in glass that can be used for food and drink libbey considers that the us regulations on food contact safety are superior to the eu rules because the us utilises better testing methods 27 allow untested medical devices into the uk ipopba via getty images in the us some medical devices have been immune for testing because they are substantially similar to something already in use there have already been cases where a device considered to be exempt was later found to be dangerous advertisement the us chamber of commerce would like the uk to adopt similar rules its submission says sector specific regulatory priorities promote greater cooperation between relevant us and uk regulators to reduce unnecessary duplication of testing spur innovation and provide greater access to the best available medical devices 28 change how the nhs prices us drugs georgeclerk via getty images the us chamber of commerce has hinted that it wants to force the nhs to pay more for drugs its comments to the trade department are a thinly veiled listing under a heading sector specific regulatory priorities asking trump to work to ensure pricing and reimbursement systems accurately and fairly reflect the value of research and development processes 29 make the nhs pay as much as possible for new equipment ruizluquepaz via getty images advertisement the advanced technology association which is the largest medical device association in the world simply wants to make sure the nhs pays as much as possible for us made medical equipment trump should ask the uk government to remove all price controls it says as part of a demand which on the face of it could make it difficult for the nhs to buy equipment for patients at a reasonable cost it says one of the principal negotiating objectives of the united states should be to achieve elimination of government measures such as price controls and reference pricing which deny full market access for united states products 30 bin rules to stop electrical waste ending up in landfill chris henderson via getty images advertisement uk laws on waste are designed to minimise how much electronic waste ends up in landfill sites or incinerators the national association of manufacturers however says that unnecessarily restrictive non science based regulatory approaches are tough on manufacturers despite it admits being based on possible risk
venezuela in the limelight on practically all the written audio and visual mainstream media as well as alternative media a purposeful constant drip of outright lies and half truths fake news as well as misleading information of all shades and hues about venezuela is drumming into our brains slowly bending our minds towards believing that yes the us has a vital interest in meddling in venezuela and bringing about regime change because of primarily the huge reserves of oil but also of gold coltan and other rare minerals and finally simply because washington needs full control of its backyard but and yes there is a huge but as even some of the respected progressive alternative media pretend to know amidst all that recognition of the anglozionist empire s evil hands in venezuela their but claims that venezuela specifically presidents chavez and now maduro are not blameless in their economic chaos this distorts already the entire picture and serves the empire and all those who are hesitant because they have no clue whom to support in this antagonistic us attempt for regime change for example one alternative news article starts it is true that some of venezuela s economic problems are due to the ineptitudes of the bolivarian government s socialist command economy but this overlooks the role played by the united states the united nations and the european union bingo with such a low blow beginning the uninformed reader is already primed to discount much of the interference by washington and its minions some of the so called progressive writers have already been brain smeared by calling nicolás maduro a dictator when in fact there is hardly any country farther away from a dictatorship than venezuela in the last 20 years and since comandante hugo chavez frias was first elected in 1998 and came to power in 1999 venezuela had another 25 fully democratic elections of which 6 took place in the last year and a half they were all largely observed by the us based carter institute the latin american celac some were even watched by the european union eu the very vassal states that are now siding with washington in calling president maduro an illegitimate dictator and instead they side with and support the real illegitimate never elected us trained and appointed juan guaidó former president carter once said of all the elections he and his institute observed the ones in venezuela were by far the most transparent and democratic ones by september 2017 the carter center had observed 104 elections in 39 countries despite this evidence washington paid and corrupted anglozionist msm are screaming and spreading lies election fraud and that nicolás maduro is illegal a dictator oppressing his people depriving them of food and medication sowing famine he has to go such lies are repeated ad nauseam in a world flooded by pyramid dollars fake money the presstitute media have no money problem dollars the funding source for the massive big lie propaganda are just printed as debt never to be repaid again so why worry the same zionists who control the media also control the western money machines i e the fed wall street the bis bank for international settlement the so called central bank of central banks the european central bank the bank of england and the banks of london the western public armchair warriors all the way to caviar socialists believe these lies that s how our unqualified brains apparently work a recent independent poll found that 86 of all venezuelans including from the opposition want no interference by the us and her puppet allies but want to remain a sovereign state deciding themselves on how to resolve their internal problem economics and otherwise let me tell you something if mr maduro would be a dictator and all the diabolical adjectives that he is smeared with were to apply he would have long ago stopped the western propaganda machine which is the western controlled media in venezuela they control 90 of the news in venezuela but he didn t and doesn t because he believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the media even if the media are really nothing more than abject western lie machines presstitute mr maduro is generous enough not to close them down which any dictator of which there are now many in latin america take a pick argentina chile ecuador brazil colombia paraguay uruguay guatemala honduras would have done long ago from the very beginning when hugo chavez was first elected in 1998 washington attempted to topple him to bring about régime change the first real coup attempt took place on 11 april 2002 under full command by washington chavez was ousted for less than 2 days when an on swell of people and the vast majority of the military requested his reinstatement chavez was brought back from his island seclusion and thus the directly washington led coup d état was defeated the revolution will not be televised but the pressure mounted with economic sanctions becoming ever bolder and in the case of venezuela they had severe economic and humanitarian impacts because venezuela imports close to 90 of her food and medication still today and most of it from the us both chavez and maduro had very little leeway of doing differently what they have already done sanctions boycotts outside money manipulations driving inflation to astronomical levels and constant smear propaganda these predicaments are biting hard the us has a firm grip on venezuela s dollar dependency last week washington confiscated about us 23 billion venezuela s reserve money in us banks blocked them from use by the legitimate maduro government and instead handed them to their us appointed puppet never elected president juan guaidó he is now able to use venezuela s money in his us eu and lima group supported shadow government will he dare i don t think so however he has already invited us petro companies to come to venezuela and invest in and take over the petrol industry of course it will not happen as president maduro stays in power firmly backed by the military all of this sounds like a bad joke did you ever heard of juan guaidó before the us and her european vassals almost unanimously and obediently aped washington in supporting him likewise the bank of england withheld 1 2 billion dollars worth of venezuelan reserve gold refusing to respond to the maduro government s request to return the gold to caracas both cases represent an extreme breach of confidence up to now it was ethically commercially and financially unthinkable that reserve money and gold deposited in foreign banks would not be safe from hooligan theft because that s what it is what the us is doing stealing other countries money that was deposited in good fate in their banks in a recent interview with rt president maduro said there was absolutely no need for humanitarian aid as the un suggested prompted by the us this so called humanitarian aid has everywhere in the world only served to infiltrate foreign and destabilizing elements into countries just look at syria libya iraq afghanistan to name just a few while the us 23 billion blocked in new york banks could have supplied venezuela with 20 years worth of medication for the venezuelan people maduro asserted venezuela has enough liquidity to feed and medicate her people however what this latest trump plunder the money and gold confiscation does is hammering one more nail in the western monetary system s suicide coffin it sends an ever clearer signal to the rest of the world to those that haven t noticed yet that the anglozionist empire cannot i repeat cannot be trusted ever and the european union intrinsically and vassalistically linked to the washington rogue state is not to be trusted either there is virtually no circumstance under which a country s assets in western foreign lands as bank deposits or foreign investments are safe it will prompt a move away from the dollar system away from the western also entirely privately owned swift international transfer system by which sanctions can be enacted indeed russia and china and much of the sco shanghai organization cooperation members are no longer dealing in us dollars but in their own currencies we are talking about half the world s population breaking free from the dollar hegemony europe has started a half assed attempt to circumvent the dollar and swift system for dealing with iran europe s special purpose vehicle or spv is called instex short for instrument in support of trade exchanges it is a project of germany france and the uk suspiciously chaired by the latter to be endorsed by all 28 eu members it aims in a first instance at shipping humanitarian aid to iran similarly to venezuela iran s foreign minister javad zarif after learning about the details considered the conditions of instex as insulting and rejected any dealings with europe under this system iran he said does not need humanitarian aid not from europe not from anybody in the meantime what was to be expected has already happened the trump administration issued a stern warning of sanctions to the eu if they would attempt to deal with iran outside of the dollar system europe is likely caving in as they always do back in venezuela the ned national endowment for democracy the extended arm of the cia has for the last two decades trained funded and infiltrated traitor agents into venezuela with the goal to assist the opposition to foment unrest to carry out assassinations and other false flags and to simply create chaos and unrest however some of these agents are also lodged in venezuela s financial institutions as part of the fifth column where they sabotage often with threats any economic policies that could rescue venezuela from its economic predicament in june 2017 i was privileged to be a member of an economic advisory team to mr maduro during three days of intense discussions with the government a number of potential short medium and long term solutions emerged they were well received by mr maduro and his economic team what became of these recommendations well maybe there are strong foreign directed forces at play to prevent their implementation clearly any accusation that the maduro government may bear the blame for some of the economic chaos have to be vigorously rejected mr maduro has very little space to maneuver the economy other than what he is already doing his actions are severely limited by the ever stronger squeeze of western claws with or without venezuela s new crypto currency the oil based petro the venezuelan economy including a major proportion of her imports is strongly linked to the us dollar with military threats and sanctions left and right there is little that the government can do in the immediate future to become autonomous yes russia and especially china will most likely help with balance of payment support loans with investments in the oil industry to ease venezuela s us dollar debt burden and ramp up oil production and in the medium and longer run they may also help boost venezuela s agricultural sector towards 100 food self sufficiency what is the real reason you may ask behind trump s intense coup d état attempt aka bolton pompeo and elliott abrams the regime change envoy or the diabolical troika s killer mission is it oil and other natural riches like gold coltan diamonds and many more rare minerals venezuela with some 301 000 mmbbl billions of barrels of known reserves has about 12 more hydrocarbon reserves than saudi arabia shipping from the gulf to texas refineries takes 40 45 days and the risk of passing through the iran controlled strait of hormuz delivering oil from venezuela to texas takes some 2 4 days is it that venezuela committed a mortal sin when circumventing the petro dollar when trading her hydrocarbons notably with china and russia in other currencies like the gold convertible yuan remember saddam hussein and muamar gadhafi attempted similar dollar escaping actions and look what it brought them the us dollar hegemony depends very much on oil and gas trade in us dollars as per an agreement of the seventies between the us and saudi arabia head of opec is it that washington cannot tolerate any socialist or socialist leaning country in its backyard cuba and nicaragua beware is venezuela a crucial stepping stone to fully dominate latin america and her resources and hence a step closer to full power dominance of the world or all of the above i believe it s all of the above with a strong accent on venezuela s abandoning the us dollar as hydrocarbon trading currency putting the dollar hegemony even more at risk once the dollar ceases to be the main reserve currency the us economy will slowly collapse what it is already doing twenty years ago the us dollar dominated world reserve coffers with about 90 today that proportion has sunk to less than 60 the dollar is rapidly being replaced by other currencies notably the chinese yuan now let s cut to the chase it is clear that the trump administration with these stupid actions of dishing out sanctions left and right punishing allies and foes alike if they deal with russia iran or venezuela and this special blunt regime change aggression in venezuela nominating a 35 year old us puppet trained in the us by cia as venezuela s new interim president confiscating venezuela s reserve assets in new york and london stopping importing petrol from venezuela and punishing anybody who imports venezuelan oil except of course russia and china the might of the us stops short of interfering in these non dollar deals with these and more ridiculous actions and military threats washington is actually not only isolating itself but is accelerating the fall of the us economy ever more countries are seeking alternative ways of doing business with currencies and monetary systems other than the dollar based fraudulent swift and eventually they will succeed all they need to do is join the china russia sco system of transfer in their local currencies and the currencies of the eastern sco block and dedollarization is moving a step further ahead dedollarization is the key to the end of the us dollar hegemony of the us economic supremacy the arrogant trump plus the impunity of the unfettered diabolical and outright dumb bolton pompeo abrams approach of military threats and intimidations may just make venezuela the straw that breaks the empire s back

a result of the downturn currently being felt across the semiconductor industry reflecting the broad based nature of the slowdown all four revenue categories declined by double digit percentages in the fourth quarter compared to q3 as many of our peers have noted the downturn appears to be cyclical in nature though it has been amplified by trade tensions and weaker domestic demand in china these additional factors have hit especially hard in the appliance and smartphone markets which accounts for roughly half of our total sales our communications category which is dominated by smartphone chargers and skews ph heavily toward chinese oems declined nearly 20 for the full year the decline was driven not only by general weak handset demand but also by slower adoption of fast charges ahead of the upcoming transition to usb pd technology our consumer category which is dominated by appliances fell 6 for the year reflecting weaker consumer demand in china as well as the impact of tariffs and broader trade disputes which have driven up the cost of appliances for us consumers while making customers and distributors more cautious about holding inventory as a result despite solid growth in our industrial and computer categories our total revenues for the full year fell by 4 while disappointed in these results we feel good about our prospects for 2019 for a number of reasons first we were among the earliest companies to feel the effects of the downturn and thus experienced a greater impact to our 2018 performance than broader industry while we can t predict the exact pace or timing of the rebound we are confident that we will also be among the first companies to benefit from the recovery as has been the case in the past cycles and while we hesitate to make predictions based on a single month of data particularly in the month of january ahead of the lunar new year holiday we are encouraged by recent trends january was our strongest month of booking since may of last year and while sell in revenues are affected by elevated channel inventories we did see a substantial drawdown in distributor inventories in january with sell through exceeding sell in by a wide margin for the month the second factor that gives us confidence for the year ahead is that while the smartphone market has a headwind was a headwind in 2018 we expect it to be a growth driver in 2019 even if the end market demand remains relatively subdued after much delay the rollout of usb pd charging technology is now under way and we are entering the next phase of growth in rapid charging we got a taste of this in the second half of 2018 with the ramp of a new usb pd tablet charger which drove strong growth in our computer category we won several high volume fast charger designs in q4 and we expect an uptick in revenues in the june quarter with much more substantial growth to come in the second half of the year third we expect continued strength in our industrial category a bright spot for us in 2018 with the growth of about 7 our high power business which makes up more than a third of the industrial category grew double digits for the second straight year driven by strength in renewable energy electric locomotives and energy exploration we are seeing healthy demand for high power products in china with spending on infrastructure such as rail and power grid projects is likely being used to offset weaker consumer demand our industrial category is also benefiting from the transition to battery power in lawn equipment vacuum cleaners and personal transportation as well as the proliferation of home and building automation products that are continuously connected to the grid and therefore benefit from our ultra low standby power technology fourth we believe that secular trends that have driven our growth in appliance market over the past several years remain intact we expect improvement in our consumer category in 2019 even after down year in 2018 our appliance revenues have grown at double digit cagr over the past eight years this growth has been driven by a variety of factors including market share gains higher dollar content and growing middle class in emerging markets where products like conditioning and dishwashers are now widely affordable than ever before we expect all of these trends to continue for years to come we see even greater opportunity in the appliance market following the november launch of our bridgeswitch motor drive products which add about add about 0 5 billion to our addressable market bridgeswitch is a highly integrated motor drive ic addressing brushless dc motors up to about 300 watts such applications include air conditioning ceiling fans and a wide range of appliance applications including refrigerator compressors water pumps dishwashers and washing machines and fans and blowers used in clothes dryers air purifiers and range hoods bridgeswitch ics offer substantial improvements in efficiency compared to existing solutions eliminating the need for heat sinks and giving designers flexibility to add features such as iot connectivity while remaining in compliance with energy efficiency regulations because our ac to dc products are already used by virtually every major appliance manufacturer in the world we are entering this market from a position of strength and we expect our reputation for quality and innovation to be a major asset for us we have design activity under way at several tier 1 appliance oems and we expect revenue from bridgeswitch products to begin ramping in 2020 in conclusion while the trajectory of the macro recovery is difficult to predict and trade remains a wild card we do expect the march quarter to be the trough of the current downturn for power integrations and we are particularly excited about the opportunity for accelerated growth in the second half of the year more importantly we are confident in our ability to outgrow the industry over time and our confidence is reflected in the fact that we are we have invested heavily in our own shares over the past year we use more than 100 million for repurchases during the year buying back roughly 5 of our shares and had 51 million remaining of our authorization at the quarter end with that i will turn it over to sandeep for the review of the financials sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer thanks balu and good afternoon as usual i will focus my remarks primarily on our non gaap numbers which are reconciled to the gaap figures in the tables accompanying our press release the one item of note in our gaap results is the tax benefit from new irs regulations clarifying the transition tax in the 2017 tax law we recalculated tax following the regulations and reversed a portion of the charge that we accrued in 2017 this resulted in a negative gaap rate tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 we have excluded this benefit from our non gaap results as shown in the reconciliation tables our revenues for the fourth quarter were 93 3 million down 14 from the fourth quarter of 2017 communications revenues were down 30 year over year in q4 reflecting weakness in smartphones while consumer revenues fell 20 driven mainly by weak demand and associated inventory adjustments in the appliance market industrial revenues grew low single digits year over year in q4 led by high power applications as well as chargers for battery operated tools lawn equipment and e bikes revenues in the computer category increased about 10 year over year driven by usb pd tablet business that began ramping in the third quarter on a sequential basis revenues were down 15 with all four categories declining double digits reflecting the breadth of the current slowdown revenue mix for the quarter was 40 industrial 34 consumer 24 20 communication and 6 computer non gaap gross margin was flat compared to the third quarter of 52 7 beating our forecast due to favorable end market mix and lower than expected consumption of higher cost wafers from our inventory non gaap operating expenses were 34 4 million more than a 1 million below our guidance we have held expenses flat for three consecutive quarters and are managing spending carefully in light of the weaker demand environment though in the year ahead we will continue to invest in our product pipeline and increase growth opportunities such as usb pd as well as the motor drive and automotive markets the non gaap effective tax rate for the quarter was just under 1 bringing our full year rate to 5 6 a bit below the expected range due mainly to the effect of the downturn on the geographic distribution of our income including a 0 03 benefit from lower than expected tax rate fourth quarter non gaap earnings were 0 54 per diluted share weighted average share count was 29 7 million for the quarter down more than 300 000 shares from the prior quarter as we have done consistently over the years we have deployed our balance sheet to take advantage of pull backs in the market we utilized 29 million for share repurchases in the fourth quarter buying back 488 000 shares at an average price of about 59 per share over the course of the year we utilized 103 million for repurchases buying back roughly 5 of our outstanding shares including dividends we returned 122 million to stockholders in 2018 even after the substantial return of cash our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling 229 million at quarter end we generated 84 million in cash from operations during the year up slightly from the prior year in spite of significant increase in inventories which consumed about 24 million in cash we believe this demonstrates the cash generation capacity of our business which should be more fully reflected as our inventory levels begin to normalize later in the year based on the strength of our balance sheet and expectation of continued strong cash flow our board has increased our quarterly dividend to 0 17 per share as balu noted we also had 51 million remaining on our repurchase authorization at the beginning of the current quarter and we continue to employ our price sensitive approach to buying back stock at quarter end internal inventories stood at 163 days up 35 days from the prior quarter we expect to remain at a fairly elevated level of inventory for the next couple of quarter and then to reduce inventories in the second half as we ramp new usb pd charger design for the smartphone market i would reiterate that we re comfortable carrying a higher than normal level of inventory during a downturn knowing that most of our products are not customer or application specific and carry minimal of solace and risk we are maintaining a higher percentage of our inventory in die bank which further mitigates our risks and positions us well to respond in event of a sudden recovery in demand looking ahead we expect first quarter revenues to be in the range of 90 million plus or minus 3 million as noted earlier we expect non gaap gross margin to decline as higher cost wafers flow through our inventory specifically we are forecasting non gaap gross margin to be around 52 non gaap operating expenses for the march quarter should tick up modestly due to seasonal factors such as fica taxes and the comparative effects of the year end shutdown that took place in december specifically i expect non gaap opex to be in the range of 35 million to 35 5 million lastly i expect the non gaap tax rate for the quarter and the year to be approximately 7 and with that i ll turn it back over to joe joe shiffler director of investor relations thanks sandeep we ll open it up now for the q a session christina would you please give the instructions for the q a questions and answers operator certainly operator instructions your first question comes from ross seymore from deutsche bank your line is open ross seymore deutsche bank analyst hey guys thanks for letting me ask the question a couple ones here on the revenue side and linearity of demand balu you mentioned that i think january bookings were the strongest since last may any color about where they re coming from end markets is it finally refilling channel inventory any sort of qualitative or quantitative detail on that would be helpful balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer it is broad based and a significant part of it is also coming from appliance market where it looks like they have ran out of inventory and i also want to point out that the sell through revenue was much stronger than sell in in january which is good that means that the demand is improving ross seymore deutsche bank analyst and i guess as far as the second half goes relative to last quarter and the same earnings call you basically said the same thing about the second half and the competence et cetera has anything changed as you look into the back half not only in the usb pd business first and foremost but around any of the other company specific metrics and design wins that you planned at that time at least to have ramp in the second half balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer no it s actually playing out exactly as we planned we won the number of designs particularly in the usb pd and so we expect a strong second half and we also think q2 will have a growth the growth quarter but second half will be much stronger sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer the second quarter as balu is indicating is we are talking on a sequential basis from the first quarter ross seymore deutsche bank analyst got you then one last one if i could sneak it in on the margin front for you sandeep i think on the last quarterly call you talked about the gross margin might be a little weaker year over year given the confidence in the comes in the phone ramp is that still the case and then i think you also said opex to be up about 6 or 7 year over year does that change given the lower level at which you exited last year and then i ll go away thanks sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer yeah i guess your question is for the year i m presuming for 2019 right ross seymore deutsche bank analyst correct sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer yeah so i think the gross margin for the year as i had indicated earlier will be around 51 5 i expect it to be for the year roughly in that range and the expense growth as you indicated will be in the 5 to 6 range ross seymore deutsche bank analyst got it thank you sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer year over year balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer thanks ross operator your next question comes from cody acree from loop capital your line is open cody acree loop capital markets analyst thank you guys for taking my questions and congrats on the progress maybe just following up on ross question as you look into the us pd ramp can you just maybe give us any details on where you re seeing your design wins balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer we have actually one designs with multiple oems and we expect the production to start pre production start in q2 and that s why we think that we will have a sequential growth in q2 followed by a much stronger second half where the number of these will go into full production cody acree loop capital markets analyst and what i guess trying to define what this could be as a percentage of revenue what are why are you thinking this could become in 2019 2020 i guess balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer it s hard to be precise but i think directionally what i d like to give you an answer is from an end market mix i think the highest growth we would probably get is from the communication segment which is probably driven by the cellphone and i would say that all other three segments will also grow given take roughly around equally but i think the would be disproportionately higher in end market mix this year cody acree loop capital markets analyst okay great and then lastly just the turn you ve seen in order demand has that been you said it s been broad based but i know the appliances have been one of your more problematic segment so are you seeing it s more geographically based or are you seeing it broad based globally and across all your end markets balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer yeah i want to warn that is just one month of information and january is usually a strong bookings month anyway because of lunar new year before the holidays people tend to book a lot but assuming that is an indicator we feel pretty good that you know all other markets of course communications will do really well this year that we believe but even the other markets are likely to grow this year so but i guess the biggest positive is the drawdown of inventory at the distributors in january if you compare that to q4 q4 the sell in and sell through are roughly equal we were expecting sell through to be stronger in q4 but it wasn t whereas in january the sell through was much stronger than sell in and that to me is a very positive indication and if that is true we should do well in appliances which is not done well last year cody acree loop capital markets analyst great thank you guys balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from tore svanberg from stifel your line is open tore svanberg stifel analyst yes thank you and i apologize if i m making some very specific questions here but when do you expect to be back to year over year growth i assume that will happen sometime in the second half balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer yeah in fact the second half we should get back to double digit growth on a year over year basis tore svanberg stifel analyst excellent very good and with that sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer that s for the entire second half tore that s for the entire second half not necessarily any particular quarter tore svanberg stifel analyst got it got it understood and if we then look at your inventory days now standing at 167 with that type of growth you should probably be back down to 110 or so in the second half sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer i think we will be back in our model somewhere our model is always 110 plus or minus 15 and i think we should get into our model in the 120 range somewhere by the third quarter tore svanberg stifel analyst okay very good sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer the first half will be elevated q1 could be slightly above even q4 but i think it will get normalized by the third quarter tore svanberg stifel analyst very good and balu now that the usb pd market is finally taken off is it worth asking questions about what type of power levels are you seeing out there because i guess the higher the power levels are the faster the charging maybe the higher the confidence is for you so what type of power level should we start to see here into 2019 balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer for usb pd we are seeing power levels all the way from 18 watts up to 60 watts for cellphones but obviously the higher power ones like 40 watts and 60 watts tend to be relatively low volume because of the higher end most of the volume is on the lower end which is 18 watts 27 watts and 25 watts and so on tore svanberg stifel analyst very good and then just one last question on bridgeswitch which is your latest market you mentioned 2020 revenue contribution should we assume that this business will be very gradual as a lot of your other new markets or could revenue be a little bit more substantial balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer it will be gradual simply because the appliance market not only has longer design cycles but it also has a slow ramp usually they ll design into one or two models and then migrate it to other models so our expectation is in 2020 it should be in the few million dollars of kind of thing i mean single digit millions tore svanberg stifel analyst very good thank you very much balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from ed roesch from sidoti company your line is open ed roesch sidoti company analyst yeah hi congrats on managing through that environment pretty nicely there wanted to look at parts of the communications other than smartphones to begin with i know you historically had some router business in there but then also looking at base station deployment starting perhaps for 5g in the coming year are those end markets showing any signs of life for you at this time balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer well the router market is basically an external adapter market so it s on the low end of the scale and we have deep focus away from it over the last few years but the base station market for 5g could be an interesting market but as you know the deployment will be relatively small from what everything we know in 2019 we certainly are watching that market to see whether we could it could help us grow our communications revenue outside of cellphones ed roesch sidoti company analyst okay and then switching to usb pd the new sound is pretty good there it s very encouraging for incremental revenue coming from that but would you say balu that the kind of the consumer value seeking that we ve started to see in the smartphone market could potentially narrow the scope for the adoption of that what kind of cost does that add to the bundle that the consumer is getting balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer the cost added is very small compared to the phone itself phone is the biggest cost there is an incremental cost but the value you get out of it i think is something the customer s highly desire we have seen a lot of blogs where people really prefer fast charging because many times in the middle of the day they need to charge the phone and they don t have the time to wait for hours so we think that it is a value add that will attract people to buy next generation phones rather than just a increase in cost in fact i think it is very small compared to the costs of the cellphone ed roesch sidoti company analyst that makes sense and then the last thing i don t know sandeep if you mentioned that the capital spending outlook for 2019 sorry for that sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer that will be kind of similar to 18 million around 25 million ed roesch sidoti company analyst okay operator all right thanks very much sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer welcome balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer thanks ed operator operator instructions your next question comes from christopher rolland from susquehanna international group your line is open david haberle susquehanna international group analyst yeah it s david haberle on behalf of chris rolland thanks for taking my questions today just to start off balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome david haberle susquehanna international group analyst hello can you hear me balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer yeah i heard you i just said welcome david haberle susquehanna international group analyst sorry thank you the tensions between the united states and china seem to be dragging on your business more than some of your peers given your chinese exposure if a compromise were to be reached at some point in the next couple of months would you expect to bounce back to be fairly quickly in your business or were there need to be a period of time for business to pick backups balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer that s a very good question i think our gut feeling is it will have a positive impact not just on us in the overall business for semiconductors whether we ll have a differential impact i really don t know david haberle susquehanna international group analyst got it and then second one on the distributor inventory levels i believe they were at about eight weeks last quarter can you talk about what you re seeing in distribution inventory levels balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer well they are a little elevated to where the revenue is but we if january is an indicator we saw the sell through coming much higher than sell in so we believe over the next couple of quarters they will get back to the normal levels david haberle susquehanna international group analyst got it and then last one for me on the industrial business your seasonality is typically very strong in the first half of the year but given the weaker macro picture how should we think about linearity of industrial as we kind of move through the year is it going to be a different shape than it typically would be balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer well in industrial roughly about one third of it is high power business which is closely tied to lot of infrastructure type of investments such as renewable energy high voltage dc transmission and electric locomotives and so on and we are seeing a healthy growth we actually had double digit growth two years in a row 2017 and 2018 we don t know how much we re going to grow this year but we certainly expect to grow in high power and interestingly we are seeing more investment infrastructure from china possibly because they want to the screws up the economy and so that part i think will grow this year and the remaining part the other two thirds is very fragmented we ve talked about the couple of areas where we see very strong growth like the home and building automation and power tools but there are also other other areas that could grow nicely this year which is like meters and motor control and so on and so forth so overall we think the industrial market will grow this year we just don t know how much david haberle susquehanna international group analyst got it thank you very much balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from ross seymore from deutsche bank your line is open ross seymore deutsche bank analyst hi guys i know you have a typically a difficult time in a single quarter knowing which segments are going to move which direction but i think on the last quarterly call you kind of gave us some hints on what you thought for the fourth quarter by segment any similar hint you could provide for the first quarter especially important given the trajectory you have through the rest of the year to kind of get our starting point normalized sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer so i think you should see improvement on the consumer segment and that s why where we talked about favorability and typically the industrial is slightly down and the reason for that is that the power business in the first quarter is typically a little lower that s when the funding comes through so i think the mix is going to get slightly favorable and that s what offsets the impact that we have of the higher wafer cost and that s why i think the gross margin guide i gave of about 52 for the first quarter ross seymore deutsche bank analyst and the comp side of things i know it was down substantially last quarter does it seasonally i know it goes down sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer typically in the first quarter comps is a little lower than normal but i think you ll start seeing comp start picking up as balu indicated with the usb pd design win in the second quarter ross seymore deutsche bank analyst got it that was it from me thanks guys sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer welcome balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer thanks ross

reserve advisory the recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil reserves provided in this news release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein all december 31 2018 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective

effective january 1 2017 it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 percent probability that

used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22 3 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 31 1 degrees api gravity and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 22 3 degrees api gravity with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for that year this press release contains several oil and gas metrics including f d costs fd a costs recycle ratio reserve replacement nav and rli these oil and gas metrics have been prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the company s operations over time readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this news release should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes a summary of the calculations of such metrics are as follows finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing capital expenditures by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category f d costs including fdc include all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition fd a costs represent the costs of property acquisition exploration and development incurred the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fd a costs are calculated as capital expenditures plus net acquisition costs plus change in fdc fd a per boe is calculated as fd a costs divided by reserves additions for the applicable period recycle ratio is calculated as funds flow from operations per boe divided by f d or fd a as applicable funds flow from operations per boe is calculated by dividing funds flow from operations by sales volume for the period reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual reserve additions by the annual production net asset value nav per share is calculated as before or after tax npv10 plus estimated year end working capital converted from usd to cad as applicable divided by basic shares outstanding at december 31 2018

interview by iran s fars news agency fna with peter koenig introduction by fna tehran economist and geopolitical analyst peter koenig says it is profoundly clear that french president emmanuel macron is pursuing a policy against his pre election promise enmarche movement commenting on macron s taxing policy former world bank economist says he transforms public wealth into private wealth and shifts it upwards by slashing taxes for the rich and imposing new taxes on poor and middle class citizens reducing pensions unemployment health benefits etc peter koenig believes the move by the yellow vests is an opportunity for change which can indeed be spread to other countries in europe and the united states below is the full text of the interview q the protesting yellow vests want macron out of elysee how has macron turned to a figure intensely disliked by so many of his own people a the french were disgusted by president françois hollande emmanuel macron s predecessor hollande was nominally a socialist but he had no backbone and sold france out to neoliberalism actually hollande was the epitome of the non distinction of parties i e no matter what the party color the overarching ruling force throughout the western world had become neoliberalism in many cases bordering on neo fascism france was a case in point and was well prepared for what was to follow up came the new king macron who had no party and still has no party but a movement called enmarche meaning more or less let s move forward from 2014 to 2016 macron was minister of economy and finance a period during which he prepared the very unpopular new labor law under which eventually workers might lose most of their accumulated labor rights could be hired and fired by industry without hardly any protection the law was finally implemented during macron s first year in office previously from 2008 coincidentally the year when the man made financial crisis began to 2012 macron was a successful investment banker at rothschild bank where he learned the ropes of international finance debt restructuring and in fact debt enslaving in hindsight it is clear that he was prepared for the presidency by the rothschild clan and the elite that is behind it campaigning from about mid 2016 to the 2017 elections he was propped up by the banking funded media he promised a new government of the people and for the people with his new movement enmarche with the help of false flags i e the 14th july 2016 french national holiday massacre in nice he promised more security a permanent emergency law akin to martial law if he became president after this and previous false flags in paris people screamed for more security from terrorism largely unaware that it was state terrorism and with the help of internet facebook cambridge analytica propaganda campaign roi macron was elected in the second round on 7 may 2017 with according to the going democratic system a decisive margin but in fact with less than 25 of the eligible french electorate soon after his election victory he turned around disregarded his pre election promises which is not unusual for politicians in general but what distinguished macron from others he displayed an abject arrogance almost an outright disrespect or even disgust for the common people whom he promised to govern for started slashing taxes for the rich and imposing new taxes on poor and middle class citizens reducing pensions unemployment and health benefits and so on eventually the new so called eco gasoline tax was just about the legendary drop that brought the barrel to overflow and macron s popularity dropped to below 18 macron eventually rescinded the new fuel tax and other taxes as well as increased the minimum wage by 100 per month with an apologetic face which was clearly fake a gesture too little too late on public television plus in his televised speech he did not mention with one word the new most unpopular labor law he put through parliament where his movement has an absolute majority withdrawing that unpopular law may have just given macron the credit he missed and still misses but his capitalist backers would of course not allow such a profit infringing concession today the yellow vests and much of the french people want nothing less than macron s resignation q how do these unrests affect the economy a there are two sides of economics the one for the protesters and the french people per se is that they are unhappy with the continuous deterioration of the purchasing power of french wages and hard earned social benefits they require an outright reversal of the upward shift of capital from the working class to the elite a trend that is clearly visible not only in france but also in most other western countries especially the us if the yellow vests succeed that might mean an economic upheaval perhaps an economic revolution that could spread to other countries in europe and possibly beyond i trust that the french yellow vests are well aware of this and that their protests are calls for change way beyond the french borders and in fact it already shows as protests have started perhaps under other pretexts in hungary belgium the netherlands romania etc in germany chancellor merkel s days are counted who and what will follow her there is a tremendous social discontent in germany for reasons not much different from the ones in france falling purchasing power increasing poverty a large proportion of the german population mostly women works part time and many of them especially single mothers need at least two jobs to survive they escape the unemployment statistics the capital controlled media will not report and inform the people of the truth lying has been their bread and butter and this doesn t likely change unless the system changes this might mean exit from the euro and exit from the eu i e frexit the macro economic benefit for the country would be tremendous of course as with brexit the tremendous benefits for the people will not be reported either by the mainstream media because it would be a slap in the face of unfettered neoliberal capitalism to the contrary people are intimidated with threats of a looming disaster if their countries would break loose from the already defunct european union it would mean going back to the roots of economics i e basically re vamp the economy by local production for local markets with a local currency and a public banking system that works for the french people for the french economy and not for the shareholders in far away countries i e wall street and large european private banks people would be motivated to work for their country and their well being thereby boosting the local economy and local well being if greece would have taken this step in 2008 to 2009 when the man made crisis hit with a grexit so to speak greece would today be well recovering would be a prosperous country with a recovered social system and most particularly without a strangulating debt on the other hand if things stay the way they are now with macron s few half hearted concessions the cost to the french economy is estimated at about 8 to 10 billion euros who will pay for them this is the question as long as macron stays in power nothing will significantly change for the rich as he will not reverse the tax system they put him in the presidency so he transforms public wealth into private wealth and shifts it upwards this means the funds have to be found stolen somewhere like for example in the former french colonies which are still heavily under the yoke of the french central bank they cannot control their own reserves as their economies are hamstrung by the french economy a little known fact in other words if the situation stays as it is no radical breakthrough by the yellow vests the situation for the french economy may be worse or rather the official version will blame the protesters while the extra money is most likely being squeezed from the poor possibly in the former french colonies in one way or another q how do you see the future can such crisis be spread to other countries in the european union or even the us will that leave any room for transatlantic relations a the future is unpredictable indeed a clear case of dynamics how do the people and how do politicians react and how does this interaction between different interest groups affect the overall outcome you call it crisis i call it an opportunity yes the opportunity for change can indeed be spread to other countries in europe and why not to the united states some signs as i mentioned before are already on the horizon of course the controlling power the neoliberal everything goes capitalism will not just cave in they have too much at stake but there are also other forces playing along simultaneously for example asia is becoming stronger by the day with china s xi jinping s new silk road or belt and road initiative bri well under way since 2013 and gradually engulfing and covering eurasia and europe with a new way of trade transport infrastructure build up and a new economic system the global equation will be changed and changed for the better of the people in this sense macron is just a little boy a little king in a small country as compared to a large and long term movement towards a more equal global but multi polar economy if the yellow vests see beyond their own french interests if they see the big picture of a new economy which is already shaping up in the east they may be a valuable contributor and accelerator for change first published by fars

venezuela in the limelight on practically all the written audio and visual mainstream media as well as alternative media a purposeful constant drip of outright lies and half truths fake news as well as misleading information of all shades and hues about venezuela is drumming our brains slowly bending our minds towards believing that yes the us has a vital interest in meddling in venezuela and bringing about regime change because of primarily the huge reserves of oil but also of gold coltan and other rare minerals and finally simply because washington needs full control of its backyard but and yes there is a huge but as even some of the respected progressive alternative media pretend to know amidst all that recognition of the anglozionist empire s evil hands in venezuela their but claims that venezuela specifically presidents chavez and now maduro are not blameless in their economic chaos this distorts already the entire picture and serves the empire and all those who are hesitant because they have no clue whom to support in this antagonistic us attempt for regime change for example one alternative news article starts it is true that some of venezuela s economic problems are due to the ineptitudes of the bolivarian government s socialist command economy but this overlooks the role played by the united states the united nations and the european union bingo with such a low blow beginning the uninformed reader is already primed to discount much of the interference by washington and its minions some of the so called progressive writers have already been brain smeared by calling nicolás maduro a dictator when in fact there is hardly any country farther away from a dictatorship than venezuela in the last 20 years and since comandante hugo chavez frias was first elected in 1998 and came to power in 1999 venezuela had another 25 fully democratic elections of which 6 took place in the last year and a half they were all largely observed by the us based carter institute the latin american celac some were even watched by the european union eu the very vassal states that are now siding with washington in calling president maduro an illegitimate dictator and instead they support the real illegitimate never elected us cia trained and appointed juan guaidó former president carter once said of all the elections he and his institute observed the ones in venezuela were by far the most transparent and democratic ones by september 2017 the carter center had observed 104 elections in 39 countries despite this evidence washington paid and corrupted anglozionist msm are screaming and spreading lies election fraud and nicolás maduro is illegal a dictator oppressing his people depriving them of food and medication sowing famine he has to go such lies are repeated at nauseatum in a world flooded by pyramid dollars fake money the presstitute media have no money problem dollars the funding source for the massive lie propaganda are just printed as debt never to be repaid again so why worry the same zionists who control the media also control the western money machines i e the fed wall street the bis bank for international settlement the so called central bank of central banks the european central bank the bank of england and the banks of london the western public armchair warriors all the way to caviar socialists believe these lies that s how our unqualified brains apparently work a recent independent poll found that 86 of all venezuelans including from the opposition want no interference by the us and her puppet allies but want to remain a sovereign state deciding themselves on how to resolve their internal problem economics and otherwise let me tell you something if mr maduro would be a dictator and all the diabolical adjectives that he is smeared with were to apply he would have long ago stopped the western propaganda machine which is the western controlled media in venezuela they control 90 of the news in venezuela but he didn t and doesn t because he believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the media even if the media are really nothing more than abject western lie machine presstitute mr maduro is generous enough not to close them down which any dictator of which there are now many in latin america take your pick argentina chile ecuador brazil colombia paraguay uruguay guatemala honduras would have done long ago from the very beginning when hugo chavez was first elected in 1998 washington attempted to topple him to bring about régime change the first real coup attempt took place on 11 april 2002 under full command by washington chavez was ousted for less than 2 days when an on swell of people and the vast majority of the military requested his reinstatement chavez was brought back from his island seclusion and thus the directly washington led coup d état was defeated the revolution will not be televised but the pressure mounted with economic sanctions becoming ever bolder and in the case of venezuela they had severe economic and humanitarian impacts because venezuela imports close to 90 of her food and medication still today and most of it from the us both chavez and maduro had very little leeway of doing differently what they have already done sanctions boycotts outside money manipulations driving inflation to astronomical levels and constant smear propaganda these predicaments are biting hard the us has a firm grip on venezuela s dollar dependency last week washington confiscated about us 23 billion of venezuela s reserve money in us banks blocked them from use by the legitimate maduro government and instead handed them to their us appointed puppet never elected president juan guaidó he is now able to use venezuela s money in his us eu and lima group supported shadow government will he dare i don t think so however he has already invited us petrol companies to come to venezuela and invest in and take over the petrol industry of course it will not happen as president maduro stays in power firmly backed by the military all of this sounds like a bad joke did you ever hear of juan guaidó before the us and her european vassals almost unanimously and obediently aped washington in supporting him likewise the bank of england withheld 1 2 billion dollars worth of venezuelan reserve gold refusing to respond to the maduro government s request to return the gold to caracas both cases represent an extreme breach of confidence up to now it was ethically commercially and financially unthinkable that reserve money and gold deposited in foreign banks would not be safe from hooligan theft because that s what it is what the us is doing stealing other countries money that was deposited in good fate in their banks in a recent interview with rt president maduro said there was absolutely no need for humanitarian aid as the un suggested prompted by the us this so called humanitarian aid has everywhere in the world only served to infiltrate foreign and destabilizing elements into countries just look at syria libya iraq afghanistan to name just a few while the us 23 billion blocked in new york banks could have supplied venezuela with 20 years worth of medication for the venezuelan people maduro asserted venezuela has enough liquidity to feed and medicate her people however what this latest trump plunder the money and gold confiscation does is hammering one more nail in the western monetary system s suicide coffin it sends an ever clearer signal to the rest of the world to those that haven t noticed yet the anglozionist empire cannot i repeat cannot be trusted ever and the european union is intrinsically and vassalically linked to the washington rogue state not to be trusted either there is virtually no circumstance under which a countries assets in western foreign lands as bank deposits or foreign investments are safe it will prompt a move away from the dollar system away from the western also entirely privately owned swft international transfer system by which sanctions can be enacted indeed the russia and china and much of the sco shanghai organization cooperation members are no longer dealing in us dollars but in their own currencies we are talking about half the world s population broke free from the dollar hegemony europe has started a half assed attempt to circumvent the dollar and swift system for dealing with iran europe s special purpose vehicle or spv is called instex short for instrument in support of trade exchanges it is a project of germany france and the uk suspiciously chaired by the latter to be endorsed by all 28 eu members it aims in a first instance at shipping humanitarian aid to iran similarly to venezuela iran s foreign minister javad zarif after learning about the details considered the conditions of instex as insulting and rejected any dealings with europe under this system iran he said does not need humanitarian aid not from europe not from anybody in the meantime what was to be expected has already happened the trump administration issued a stern warning of sanctions to the eu if they would attempt to deal with iran outside of the dollar system europe is likely caving in as they always do back in venezuela the ned national endowment for democracy the extended arm of the cia has for the last two decades trained funded and infiltrated traitor agents into venezuela with the goal to assist the opposition to foment unrest to carry out assassinations and other false flags and to simply create chaos and unrest however some of these agents are also lodged in venezuela s financial institutions as the fifth column where they sabotage often with threats any economic policies that could rescue venezuela from its economic predicament in june 2017 i was privileged to be a member of an economic advisory team to mr maduro during three days of intense discussions with government a number of potential short medium and long term solutions emerged they were well received by mr maduro and his economic team what became of these recommendations well maybe there are strong foreign directed forces at play to prevent their implementation clearly any accusation that the maduro government may bear the blame for some of the economic chaos have to be vigorously rejected mr maduro has very little space to maneuver the economy other than what he is already doing his actions are severely limited by the ever stronger squeeze by western claws with or without venezuela s new crypto currency the oil based petro the venezuelan economy including a major proportion of her imports is strongly linked to the us dollar with military threats and sanctions left and right there is little that the government can do in the immediate future to become autonomous yes russia and especially china will most likely help with balance of payment support loans with investments in the oil industry to ease venezuela s us dollar debt burden and vamp up oil production and in the medium and longer run they may also help boosting venezuela s agricultural sector towards 100 food self sufficiency what is the real reason you may ask behind trump s intense coup d état attempt aka bolton pompeo and elliott abrams the regime change envoy or the diabolical troika s killer mission is it oil and other natural riches like gold coltan diamonds and many more rare minerals venezuela with some 301 000 mmbbl billions of barrels of known reserves has about 12 more hydrocarbon reserves than saudi arabia shipping from the gulf to texas refineries takes 40 45 days and the risk of passing through the iran controlled strait of hormuz delivering oil from venezuela to texas takes some 2 4 days is it that venezuela committed a mortal sin when circumventing the petro dollar when trading her hydrocarbons notably with china and russia in other currencies like the gold convertible yuan remember saddam hussein and muamar gadhafi attempted similar dollar escaping actions and look what it brought them the us dollar hegemony depends very much on oil and gas trade in us dollars as per an agreement of the seventies between the us and saudi arabia head of opec is it that washington cannot tolerate any socialist or socialist leaning country in its backyard cuba and nicaragua beware is venezuela a crucial stepping stone to fully dominate latin america and her resources and hence a step closer to full power dominance of the world or all of the above i believe it s all of the above with a strong accent on venezuela s abandoning the us dollar as hydrocarbon trading currency putting the dollar hegemony even more at risk once the dollar ceases to be the main reserve currency the us economy will slowly collapse what it is already doing twenty years ago the us dollar dominated world reserve coffers with about 90 today that proportion has sunk to less than 60 the dollar is rapidly being replaced by other currencies notably the chinese yuan now let s cut to the chase it is clear that the trump administration with these stupid actions of dishing out sanctions left and right punishing allies and foes alike if they deal with russia iran or venezuela and this special blunt regime change aggression in venezuela nominating a 35 year old us puppet trained in the us by cia as venezuela s new interim president confiscating venezuela s reserve assets in new york and london stopping importing petrol from venezuela and punishing anybody who imports venezuelan oil except of course russia and china the might of the us stops short of interfering in these non dollar deals with these and more ridiculous actions and military threats washington is actually not only isolating itself but is accelerating the fall of the us economy ever more countries are seeking alternative ways of doing business with currencies and monetary systems other than the dollar based fraudulent swift and eventually they will succeed all they need to do is joining the china russia sco system of transfer in their local currencies and the currencies of the eastern sco block and dedollarization is moving a step further ahead dedollarization is the key to the end of the us dollar hegemony of the us economic supremacy the arrogant trump plus the impunity of the unfettered diabolical and outright dumb bolton pompeo abrams approach of military threats and intimidations may just

the arab world needs a collective security architecture the u s project of a middle east strategic alliance mesa could in theory be a step forward especially as it links military security to political and economic security but so far mesa has been conceived to meet u s needs to target iran and to reduce u s regional presence without allowing china or russia to gain influence while disregarding the priorities and constraints of prospective arab member states u s and arab officials acknowledge that mesa is a collective work in progress another working group meeting on mesa is expected to take place later this month certain elements will be crucial to address if it is to happen and even more so if mesa is to succeed in building regional security rather than merely fueling the regional arms race what is mesa and why did the united states propose it mesa was first announced during u s president donald trump s visit to saudi arabia in may 2017 the riyadh declaration described the alliance as contributing to peace and security in the region and the world it will include all gulf cooperation council gcc states bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the uae as well as egypt jordan and the united states the idea revolves primarily around security but more recently it has adopted economic and political aspects as well it joins a rather crowded field of regional alliances that exist in practice or on paper or are still under consideration yasmine farouk yasmine farouk is a nonresident scholar in the middle east program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more yasfarouk such an alliance fits squarely within the thinking of not only the trump administration see for example the december 2017 national security strategy and 2018 national defense strategy but also the preceding administration of barack obama both articulated a desire to scale back the u s security posture in the middle east the defense strategy promotes expanding regional consultative mechanisms and deepen interoperability to share the burden of protecting u s allies and interests across the world in the middle east this strategy is compatible with trump s determination to reduce the u s contribution to regional security and make u s support strictly equivalent to what gulf countries pay from now on gulf countries will have to pay more to secure themselves and to reimburse in trump s word the united states for previous decades of protection the trump administration expects arab countries led by saudi arabia to continue controlling oil prices and to back u s policies against russia and china mesa was initially conceived to build gulf states capabilities to counter iran without intervention by the united states or russian or chinese intervention recently however state department officials have been trying to reshape it to reflect larger strategic objectives tim lenderking u s deputy assistant secretary of state for arabian gulf affairs indicated that the alliance would focus on iran cyber concerns attacks on infrastructure and coordinating conflict management from syria to yemen along with counterproliferation and counterterrorism and the foreign minister of bahrain sheikh khalid bin ahmed al khalifa has stated that mesa is not against anyone how does the united states envision mesa as time has passed u s officials have developed the mesa concept in a variety of ways that would allow the united states to reduce its military presence without losing clout in the region in addition to getting arab states to invest more in their own and each other s defenses u s officials will be trying to use mesa to push back against growing chinese and russian influence in the region including their support to iran the security pillar mesa seeks enhanced interoperability of member states defense systems probably through regional capabilities centers that would cover the maritime cyber air and missile domains as well as border security asymmetric warfare and command and control so far joint troops and an agreement like nato s article 5 are off the table according to the latest national defense strategy interoperability between allies entails operational concepts modular force elements communications information sharing and equipment that accelerate foreign partner modernization and ability to integrate with u s forces with u s training and systems mesa would allow members to rely on each other to fill national defense gaps the intended interoperability would certainly impose limits on the region s increasing arms purchases from european countries and most importantly russia and china this issue has become prominent in recent years saudi arabia and the uae have collaborated to fund non u s arms purchases for other arab armies china has sold ballistic missiles as well as armed drones to gulf countries and has established its first overseas military base in djibouti adjacent to u s military presence on strategic waterways arab states defense and security cooperation with russia comes at a time when russia s military and political presence in the middle east is encompassing washington s traditional allies egypt has always purchased russian arms but qatar the uae and saudi arabia may have exploited their potential purchase of russia s s 400 defense systems to extract advanced arms purchases from the united states the potential expansion of those systems beyond syria threatens u s access to and domination of airspace in the region in the words of general joseph votel commander of u s central command russia and china along with iran are increasingly competing to be the partner of choice militarily politically and economically with u s allies mesa would also allow u s control of end use violations of its arms especially violations that involve revealing u s technology to russia china north korea or those linked to the use of u s made arms against civilians the political pillar the mesa framework incorporates governance mechanisms and member states commitments to each other it would also provide member states with a mechanism for dispute resolution and a much needed platform to coordinate action during regional crises it would prevent the resulting vacuum that terrorists china or russia could otherwise fill the united states also counts on mesa s coordinated action to support its deal of the century in the israeli palestinian conflict and to implement a rapprochement with israel that could join mesa mesa countries have different assessments of how the intra gcc crisis qatar against the quartet of bahrain egypt saudi arabia and the uae affects mesa the qatari foreign minister stated that the real challenge facing the u s led alliance is to solve the gulf crisis the recent resignation of general anthony zinni the u s envoy tasked with resolving the gulf crisis and establishing mesa as well as u s secretary of state mike pompeo s recent statements seem to confirm the qatari view nevertheless the u s administration continues to pursue mesa the economic and energy pillars mesa s economic and energy pillars are far less noticed than the defense pillar mesa would boost trade and foreign direct investment between its members according to the foreign minister of bahrain in fact these pillars helped dilute mesa s political and military identity encouraging less wealthy and skeptical arab states to join through the economic pillar mesa becomes a venue to plan and coordinate regional economic development and energy sector integration with assistance from u s agencies such as the overseas private investment corporation opic the u s agency for international development usaid and the office of the u s trade representative ustr projects to reform connect and insulate energy markets in the region are a priority mesa would therefore challenge the rapidly growing chinese and russian investments and infrastructure projects in the region especially in the oil gas and nuclear energy sectors at the same time it would coordinate arab replacements of u s financial contributions to regional stabilization and assistance programs obstacles to mesa s success the alliance has gotten off to a slow start because prospective arab member states have varying levels of enthusiasm some widely shared reservations and challenges are listed below mesa lacks a convincing security framework beyond confronting iran some arab members do not agree that iran is an imminent danger nor do they agree on the best way to deal with it while u s saudi uae and bahraini statements express a need for mesa to confront iran egyptian jordanian and even qatari officials have publicly expressed reluctance kuwait and oman have not shown fervent support for mesa aside from saudi arabia bahrain and the uae no other country involved supports military action against iran kuwait qatar and oman preach and practice engagement with tehran instead of confrontation egypt and jordan tend not to oppose the u s and saudi discourse on mesa at least publicly in order to guarantee support for their regimes as well as access to benefits that may otherwise be out of reach arab states see mesa as primarily serving u s and saudi interests some regional partners are wary of establishing a new alliance instead of building the capacities of existing arab and gcc security mechanisms those mechanisms embrace a wider and more consensual vision on collective security that includes but goes beyond defense against iran mesa so far is u s made and is perceived by skeptical partners as an attempt to transform them into economic political and military tools rather than allies in the u s strategy against iran table 1 shows current collective security structures that reflect arab visions of collective security it also shows that gulf states have already made progress on the levels of interoperability and unified command within the gcc framework with support from the united states those endogenous collective mechanisms are largely ineffective yet representative of how far the gcc plus egypt and jordan are willing to go on collective defense as it stands today mesa embodies all the obstacles that continue to make those mechanisms ineffective chief among those obstacles is saudi domination of gulf security and defense policies something that gulf countries have been resisting for years yet with mesa this domination would henceforth have u s support mesa ignores domestic political drivers of instability the alliance does not incorporate threats inherent to the domestic and regional policies of the arab states involved this challenge makes mesa inconsistent with the u s goal of a middle east that is not a safe haven or breeding ground for jihadist terrorists according to the global terrorism index armed conflicts and high levels of political terror are the two main incubators of terrorism mesa members are involved in both according to the index political terror is defined as extra judicial killings torture or imprisonment without trial political terror sometimes carried out in the name of fighting terrorism is transforming some arab prisons into what professor hamed el said dubbed universities of terrorism where instead of being rehabilitated oppressed youth become radicalized meanwhile some mesa members support radical islamist actors against other members and across the region the trump administration s underestimation of the threats posed by such policies leads to a mistaken belief that more arms will bring more security and collective action that supports u s policies in the region this rationale was illustrated in pompeo s speech in cairo during his january 2019 tour of arab countries where no reference was made to such harmful arab policies within this context mesa comes as another example of u s support to arab regimes that makes the united states as well as its regional interests and allies a target of popular anger and terrorism al qaeda and the self proclaimed islamic state have shown that terrorist ideologies cannot be easily contained to small local pockets today terrorist networks have spread throughout the region into syria libya yemen egypt the horn of africa and all the way to the sahel ignoring the roots of political terror limits mesa s capacity to target iran s malign activities as pompeo described them tehran s destabilizing activities in bahrain and saudi arabia find fertile ground in the political religious and socioeconomic grievances of their shia communities u s lenience toward authoritarian regimes does not guarantee that arab states will return the favor by aligning with u s policies in the region especially if the united states is in retreat syria s restored relations with bahrain the uae and jordan illustrates this also this u s lenience is incompatible with other u s policies that threaten to inflame arab public opinions against any new alliance with the united states this is clearly the case in regards to the administration s israeli palestinian policy which is hardly supported by its arab allies articles in official arab press outlets about mesa are already negatively hinting that it is another u s project to push arab states into an alliance with israel recent saudi and egyptian actions to mitigate the domestic impact of warming relations with israel are proof that arab regimes are still wary of domestic public opinion on this issue this pushback hinders u s plans for israeli involvement with mesa joining mesa would also be hard to explain to the publics of the countries involved in the gcc rift where media campaigns have created profound popular hostility between the two sides arab states operating in regional conflicts under the banner of a u s led alliance also threatens to mobilize arab public opinions which are particularly sensitive to intra arab and intra muslim military interactions similar mobilizations occurred during the 1960s and current wars in yemen the 1991 gulf war the twenty nine years of syrian military presence in lebanon and arab countries contributions in 2003 to the u s led intervention in iraq most of those incidents spurred public hostility to the united states and israel and eventually turned into demonstrations against some incumbent arab regimes mesa suffers from expectation and confidence gaps all members have different expectations for the alliance in addition to confidence gaps with both each other and the united states arab states see mesa as primarily a military alliance and have responded accordingly skeptics see saudi arabia and the uae as more prone to addressing regional threats with military power risking escalation that could engage other mesa members egypt kuwait and jordan s limited military involvement in yemen is representative of this skepticism oman was never part of it in contrast saudi arabia intervened in yemen and bahrain threatened to intervene in qatar encouraged a military intervention in syria and has supported military action against iran the uae has joined the yemen intervention and is increasing its military presence in the horn of africa both saudi arabia and the uae are focused on enhancing their strategic autonomy which means less foreign control on the end use of their arms it is unclear why mesa would achieve a higher level of trust between its arab members and therefore a higher level of commitment beyond the current selective and verbal only engagement to gulf defense this issue is crucial given that the united states is leaving the region and thus cannot guarantee the outcome of new engagements mesa doesn t address the question of joint command and control even though this deficiency is the main reason all regional attempts at collective defense have been ineffective thus far arab members of mesa do not share the level of trust needed for information sharing that would make their maritime cyber air and missile defenses more interoperable than they already are specifically egypt saudi arabia and the uae are currently the three main contenders that do not trust each other for either command or control in fact various mesa members prevent their domestic national security institutions from working together to lower the chances of a coup until january 2018 the egyptian military establishment still judged that u s interoperability would infringe on egyptian national sovereignty the politicization of the egyptian military establishment the gulf s reservoir for ground troops is a constant source of distress to gulf countries inter arab military exercises and membership in international military coalitions still failed to establish the level of confidence needed for true operational interoperability and the standardization needed for real time collective defense that doesn t require u s command the region also has a long history of failed and bitter experiences the most relevant endogenous experience to mesa was the 1991 damascus declaration that capitalized on the momentum of the liberation of kuwait the project integrated economic and political pillars was coordinated with both the united states and iran and included syria but not jordan yet this promising structure was thwarted by arab gulf countries preference for u s over arab military protection leaving behind a sentiment of deception that is still present today on the economic level arab states also seem to be hesitant oman hosted a meeting on january 9 hailed by u s national security adviser john bolton about economic development and energy cooperation among the united states and middle east partners omani and other arab statements except for bahrain linked that meeting to the gcc rather than to mesa thus it is doubtful that mesa would produce any promising outcomes on the economic level the arab world remains unattractive to private investors because of its state organized economies corruption legal and regulatory constraints political instability socioeconomic deficiencies sanctions and the omnipresent threat of military conflicts those structural impediments require a vision for economic development that goes beyond regional economic growth built on optimizing rents all economic reports cite political decisions as the major impediment to regional economic cooperation moreover recent world bank reports indicate that gulf countries continue to use their sovereign wealth funds to secure domestic stability and to invest in emerging economies therefore those funds should not be considered as mesa resources in the energy sector u s projects are facing major challenges first the quartet boycotting qatar is determined to limit the consumption of qatari gas and to compete with it in the energy market second the u s congress is already preemptively blocking u s saudi cooperation on nuclear energy third the current crisis of confidence between u s and arab members does not encourage them to interrupt their politically and economically promising partnerships with fellow authoritarians russia and china fourth mesa will need to catch up with the evolving strategic dynamics in the eastern mediterranean s gas sector finally the united states will likely fail to include the control of oil prices in the transactional strategic bargain behind mesa the expectation that saudi arabia will control oil prices according to trump s demands has already proven to be wrong the kingdom s decision last month to lead an opec plus production cut to provide funds that sustain state spending on public acquiescence is a case in point in addition market dynamics and divisions within opec and gcc states will hinder any lasting commitment to low oil prices opec countries and russia are already concerned that u s oil production has surpassed their own with riyadh and moscow doubling down on their cooperation kuwait s reported position on chevron s role in the neutral fields and the uae s recent fdi legislation are yet more reminders that gulf countries will continue to consider oil as their lifeline and a matter of national sovereignty suggested changes for success changes could be made to mesa that would increase the alliance s chances of coming into existence and increase its ability to actually contribute to regional security instead of merely driving more arms purchases build on past or current efforts the united states should start by supporting existing efforts to build collective security mechanisms and a gcc interoperable ballistic missile defense architecture before advocating a new military alliance for collective defense on the military side the united states should dig into the lessons learned from centcom s combined maritime task forces and joint inter arab military exercises the importance of those experiences stems from increased arab interest in red sea security and the rotating command that allowed arab countries to lead joint operations the lessons learned can provide a good reference for u s expectations from any arab strategic alliance that the united states would not command address immediate sources of arab insecurity the resolution of the gcc rift must precede any talks about the establishment of a regional alliance the basis for this resolution must be a commitment from all countries to halt their meddling in the domestic affairs of each other and of all other arab states to uproot terrorism the trump administration must reverse its policy of lifting conditionality on arms purchases and link the benefits of mesa to what it dubs gradual reforms political education and socioeconomic reforms are the only way to achieve the administration s objective of security through stability in the middle east the united states must also guarantee that arab states will not use mesa related technology and weapons to silence opponents at home and abroad all arab mesa members must contribute to developing mesa s founding principles scope of action and objectives instead of just reacting to u s proposals if they do not contribute mesa will not gain momentum improve confidence between arab states and the united states the trump administration needs a more consistent middle east policy with consistent public statements as well as fewer abrupt decisions and changes in personnel u s decisions like withdrawing from syria and waiving iran oil sanctions are leading to a similar crisis of confidence that spoiled the obama administration s u s gcc strategic cooperation forum the united states has already shown its commitment to pursue mesa by holding technical meetings on its different pillars despite recent tensions in u s saudi relations in addition to the february 13 meeting in warsaw on the future of peace and security in the middle east the united states is also convening a meeting on mesa s political and security pillars the same month both meetings clearly overlap and the united states and its arab partners may discuss mesa on the sidelines of the warsaw meeting both meetings will provide indicators on whether the united states will work through these regional challenges to a robust security architecture or instead continue to overlook these obstacles correction the table has been updated to clarify the peninsula shield forces roles in 1986 and 1990 1991 conflicts

with the united states enjoying what he calls an unprecedented economic boom u s president donald trump often acts as if he has all the time in the world to focus on his paramount priority reversing decades of calamitous trade policies as he put it in tuesday s state of the union address with the united states enjoying what he calls an unprecedented economic boom u s president donald trump often acts as if he has all the time in the world to focus on his paramount priority reversing decades of calamitous trade policies as he put it in tuesday s state of the union address but trump may not have the luxury of time midwestern farmers are going bankrupt in greater numbers as their export markets vanish both democrats and republicans in congress are rising in rebellion and trump will almost certainly be forced to cave to a slew of demands from both sides for changes to the slightly renegotiated north american free trade agreement he wrapped up last summer there are widespread warnings from economists meanwhile that the u s economy could begin to sputter headed into 2020 hindered by trump s tariff wars and things are likely to get worse trump faces a self imposed march 2 deadline to reach a sweeping trade deal with china or he says he ll raise tariffs on chinese imports inflicting more pain on u s farmers and other industries trump s top economic advisor national economic council chairman larry kudlow said thursday that there was a pretty sizable distance to go on a china trade deal and after a flurry of optimism in late january when trump said he planned to meet with chinese president xi jinping a senior administration official told cnbc on thursday that a meeting between trump and xi was highly unlikely before the march deadline even though trump will be in nearby vietnam days before attending his summit with north korean leader kim jong un the two sides could however decide to extend the deadline thus the president finds himself in the uncomfortable position of trying to fulfill one of his key campaign pledges fixing america s trade problems while both democrats and his own party hold him back and with time running down before he kicks off his 2020 re election campaign even so some trade experts say trump could manage to find his way to a successful conclusion on both the china trade talks and the new nafta if he shows a willingness to compromise that until now has been largely absent in both negotiations perhaps most perilous of all for the president republican support is waning especially as farmers suffer in key midwestern and plains states from a shrunken china market and beijing s reprisal for u s tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods according to a report from the federal reserve bank of minneapolis last november more than twice as many farm operations in those states have filed for bankruptcy than was seen in 2014 the trend is still definitely going up ronald wirtz the author of the fed report told foreign policy the trend was clearly in place before the trade war but it s one more factor for farmers that were already grappling with lower commodity prices so it s taken one more major market away from them john newton the chief economist for the american farm bureau federation said his association still supported the revised nafta and trump s confrontation with china but he conceded that things would get more difficult for farmers with the agriculture department s 2018 assistance program which helped prop up prices winding down though the new 867 billion farm bill will help provide additional crop insurance and emergency aid we re not under any impression that there s another round of trade a payments coming but i don t know what the administration is considering newton said we re running out of runway for some commodities soybeans is the pressure point sixty percent of our soybeans exports went to china one third of every bushel went to china cotton s feeling it pork s feeling it but soybeans is the pressure point trump has billed his replacement for nafta the united states mexico canada agreement usmca as a brand new agreement in truth it contains most of what nafta contained with additional provisions lifted from another trade agreement trump rejected the trans pacific partnership a 12 nation pact hashed out during the obama administration but after spending a few months closely studying usmca both democrats and republicans in the house and senate say the accord contains provisions that make it worse than nafta in some ways and it has virtually no chance of passing in its current form some leading republicans also say trump doesn t have the constitutional right to pull out of nafta on his own as he s threatened to do if usmca isn t passed and even if he did that would dramatically worsen the pain on u s companies and workers before 2020 by potentially reimposing tariffs and trade restrictions that existed before nafta according to one republican senate aide who s working on the issue usmca likely couldn t even be brought to a vote without major changes even if you were to put it on the floor i m not sure there s enough republicans who will team up to support it the aide said house speaker nancy pelosi a california democrat said at her thursday news conference that she was still open to supporting a revised usmca but insisted that provisions would have to be added to enforce labor provisions including relative wage rates in the united states and mexico democrats also want to change provisions that make it easier for u s pharmaceutical companies to charge high prices for drugs because of extended patent protection the right has its own objections republican senators such as bill toomey of pennsylvania john thune of south dakota and marco rubio of florida object to some of the very provisions that the democrats embrace such as mandated higher wages for auto workers republican free traders also oppose the usmca s sunset provision under which the parties must opt to stay in after a 10 year countdown period because that discourages investment nafta had no sunset provision republicans are also deeply unhappy with loosened investor dispute settlement protections that are part of the new accord for a president who promised quick trade victories simply managing to maintain a trade deal that has been in place for a quarter of a century might prove a challenge he s being asked to wrench apart one of his administration s ostensible achievements from opposite directions the white house has so far resisted tweaking the accord by and large i think our concern is what is the administration s plan for getting to a destination actually coming to an agreement that addresses the whole panoply of issues one senior democratic house aide said the way he s gone about it has created a great deal of pain and suffering especially in the agriculture industry and for causing all this pain he might not come to any progress still there might be daylight for trump as he bids for re election if he proves willing to make concessions to all sides first to democrats and republicans over usmca and then to the chinese over beijing s refusal to surrender large parts of its long time model for technology development which includes subsidies to state owned enterprises and appropriation of u s intellectual property bill reinsch a china trade expert and former senior commerce department official said he s marginally optimistic that u s trade representative robert lighthizer can make a deal with beijing that would include long term pledges to open market access to u s firms and buy american goods as long as trump is willing to accept changes to ip acquisition that are more than cosmetic but don t address some of the problems and i don t see them giving ground on state owned enterprises for them to do what we want them to do would undercut the party s control on usmca as well says lori wallach director of global trade watch there is an obvious path to passage to agreement by a large bipartisan majority if the administration works with democrats in the house to get rid of the big pharma giveaways and strengthen the labor and environmental standards the choice is different for republicans and many of the constituencies they represent it s between no nafta and new nafta and for them no nafta is not an option but there are few signs of such flexibility by the president as yet
demise of sri lanka s independence asoka bandarage courtesy asia times the 71st anniversary of sri lanka s independence from british rule was celebrated on february 4 in a gallant ceremony at the galle face green in colombo geopolitical rivalry foreign intervention and constitutional reform for political devolution however are posing serious threats to the island s sovereignty and environmental and human well being even the country s nominal flag independence is severely threatened beginning in 1505 sri lanka s coastal lowlands were successively colonized by the portuguese the dutch and the british until the entire island came under the british with the capture of the kandyan kingdom in 1815 colonial rule was maintained through deliberate policies to divide and conquer local communities cultivate patronage and collude with local elites colonial plantations undermined local subsistence agriculture and the ecological balance while western religion and ideologies of progress and civilization weakened the people s historical pride in their cultures and the island s sovereignty in the early years following independence sri lankan governments introduced policies to nationalize plantations and other private enterprises foster local industries and develop local culture and identities the 1972 constitution replaced the island s colonial name ceylon with sri lanka declaring the country to be a free sovereign independent and democratic socialist republic these designations remain on paper but many of the post colonial policies backfired giving rise to massive youth unemployment and violent social class and communal conflicts reversing autarkic economic policies a newly elected sri lankan government introduced an open economy in 1977 giving free rein to foreign investment and imports and to privatizing hitherto state owned sectors such as transport and telecommunications the speed up of economic liberalization and the dismantling of the traditions of state welfare urged on by the world bank and the international monetary fund made 1977 a turning point in the economic and political history of the island still it was not a radical departure in that it signified an acceleration of capitalist development begun with colonial plantations in the 1830s notwithstanding promises of prosperity and freedom for all the post 1977 period saw the emergence of the horrific armed conflict over tamil separatism that lasted for more than 30 years until 2009 deepening foreign control in the years following the 2015 elections and a change in political leadership sri lanka s economic crisis foreign debt geopolitical rivalry and foreign intervention have all intensified posing serious threats to the island s independence peace and security the indian ocean along with the western pacific is expected to become the center of future world politics strategy and economics and one of the most strategically contested regions in the world china the us india and also japan and other states are struggling for influence over sri lanka which is strategically located in the heart of the indian ocean sea lanes of the indian ocean are considered to be the busiest in the world with more than 80 of global seaborne oil trade estimated to be passing through them sri lanka is central to china in its massive import of energy and export of goods the us backed political leadership in sri lanka tried to break ties with china upon coming into office in 2015 however faced with the necessity of chinese economic support notwithstanding india s concerns over chinese encirclement sri lanka has committed itself to active participation in the maritime belt and silk road initiative china s extensive network of ports and maritime facilities connecting the pacific and indian oceans in january 2017 the sri lankan government announced a deal granting china a 99 year lease of hambantota port in the south in exchange for us 1 1 billion in debt relief the debt for equity swap raises concerns over the loss of the island s strategic state assets and economic sovereignty and the long term impact on the sri lankan people another massive chinese project in sri lanka is the port city being built in colombo on 269 hectares of land reclaimed from the indian ocean this 1 4 billion project by the state owned chinese engineering firm china communications construction company cccc is the largest single foreign direct investment in sri lankan history environmental activists have pointed out that excavation of sand along the coast is destroying the habitats of various species including corals while disturbing the ecological balance and the livelihood of those in the fishing and related industries the sri lankan government suspended the project in 2015 but it was resumed in 2016 and is now rapidly moving forward the new set of environmental regulations the government is said to have negotiated with cccc is yet to be made public the port city called sri lanka s new dubai by british newspaper the guardian with its own business friendly tax regime and regulations and possibly a different legal system to the rest of sri lanka has serious implications for the island s sovereignty and independence sri lankan activists are concerned about the power a majority state owned chinese corporation would wield as landlord of the territory it leases in the port city there is concern that the port city will be a separate entity where only a certain class of wealthy people mostly foreigners will live while services would be provided by sri lankans receiving little economic benefit there is also concern that the port city will be a separate entity where only a certain class of wealthy people mostly foreigners will live while services would be provided by sri lankans receiving little economic benefit efforts are also under way by neighboring india to integrate sri lanka as well as other smaller neighbors like myanmar nepal and bhutan firmly within its sphere of economic and political influence based on a memorandum of understanding signed between the indian and sri lankan governments in april 2017 india has been invited to develop the west container terminal in the colombo port as a joint venture with the sri lanka ports authority according to the diplomat the colombo port is one of the busiest ports in south asia and an important trans shipment hub in the region after a visit to the island by japanese foreign minister taro kono in january 2018 plans have been made for japan to build an lng liquefied natural gas terminal in the colombo port and a floating storage regasification unit both the fsru and lng terminal projects are to be joint ventures by the sri lanka ports authority with both japan and india the disagreement between sri lankan president maithripala sirisena and prime minister ranil wickremesinghe regarding control of the island s ports is said to have been a key issue that led to sirisena s dismissal of wickremesinghe as pm last november he was reinstated in december wickremesinghe backed by international trade minister malik samarawickrama wanted port development specifically the east container terminal of the colombo port on the basis of an indian investment sirisena on the other hand had argued that it was vital to keep the seaport within the ambit of the sri lankan government another highly controversial agreement between india and sri lanka is the proposed economic and technology cooperation agreement etca unlike earlier bilateral trade deals with india this indo sri lanka trade deal covers trade in services especially information technology shipbuilding and engineering although the etca proposal is yet to be made public given the asymmetry in size and economic and political power of the two countries it has generated tremendous opposition from professional bodies in sri lanka they are fearful that inundation of doctors and other professionals from india would displace sri lankans in their own country there are also criticisms in the country of the bilateral trade agreement signed between the governments of sri lanka and singapore in january 2018 on grounds that sri lanka would lose millions of dollars each year due to elimination of tariffs for singapore exports among other negative effects in reverting attention to growing indian involvement in sri lanka it is necessary to consider india s plan to build a sea bridge and tunnel at a cost of more than 5 billion from the asian development bank to connect the southern tip of india with the northwest of sri lanka sri lanka s territorial integrity sovereignty and unique cultural heritage were maintained historically through its physical separation from its large and powerful neighbor as such there is fear particularly among the sinhala buddhist majority that the easy influx of indian hindus and muslims into sri lanka through the planned bridge would change the demographic make up of sri lanka turning them into a minority in the island it is also believed that in the long term the bridge could well threaten the territorial integrity of india itself by providing the basis for the long held tamil separatist dream of greater eelam combining tamil nadu and northern sri lanka renewing conflict and violence in the process in august 2016 the first joint operation between the us and sri lankan militaries took place in jaffna with participation of tna tamil national alliance politicians at the launch since 2016 us navy ships have visited colombo and us seventh fleet vessels and the aircraft carrier uss john c stennis have visited the eastern port of trincomalee trincomalee the second deepest natural harbor in the world is considered to be of great strategic military value in the indian ocean last december the us navy announced the setting up of a logistic hub in sri lanka to secure support supplies and services at sea on december 31 us president donald trump signed the asia reassurance initiative act to strengthen the us strategic position in asia vis à vis china according to recent reports between january 24 and 29 this year bandaranaike international airport in sri lanka was used for us military planes to bring in supplies and for aircraft aboard the john c stennis to fly in load and ferry them back the sri lankan government has not responded to questions regarding the violation of sri lankan sovereignty inherent in these acts indeed has sri lanka been turned into a theater for the foremost geopolitical struggle of the 21st century constitutional reform an october 2015 un human rights council resolution co sponsored by the us and sri lankan governments called on the sri lankan government to devolve power as the means to political settlement reconciliation and human rights this infamous resolution has to be understood in the broader context of us strategic interests in sri lanka high level us government officials have admitted a direct link between the united nations resolution and a new constitution for sri lanka and have offered assistance to draft and monitor its adoption claiming a shared responsibility to help this process through in september 2016 the united states also signed a partnership with sri lanka allowing the us house of representatives to work with the sri lankan parliament to help develop an accountable effective and independent legislature thereby raising issues about external interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state sri lanka s treatment as a client state was also evident in unwarranted interference by diplomats of the us and its allies the uk canada and the european union during the crisis caused by the sri lankan president s dismissal of the prime minister last october the current government in sri lanka does not have a mandate to introduce a new constitution and change the governance structure from a unitary to a federal state moreover the national government that initiated the constitution making process in march 2016 was replaced in october 2018 with a minority government without a legal or moral basis for continuing constitutional reform nevertheless constitutional reforms backed by the us and its allies that are under consideration could be adopted by parliament in the near future the proposed reforms would provide a framework for each province to become constitutionally independent with the freedom to secede from a federal union although only tamil politicians claiming to represent the northern province have been clamoring for separation the proposed federal structure is likely to encourage other politicians to take up secession and call for new names and flags for their regions as well the political fragmentation and destabilization engendered by the draft constitution could result in several warring mini states greater foreign political and military intervention and deeper economic control over local assets sri lankans from all ethnic religious social class and political backgrounds need to understand the geopolitical threats facing the country and the dangers of proposed constitutional reforms and stand up for sri lanka s sovereignty and territorial integrity it is important for us to put aside narrow ethno religious divisions promoted by self interested politicians and foreign interests and come together to protect

forward looking statement except as required by law whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise non gaap financial measures in addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with gaap we have provided certain financial measures that are not in accordance with gaap ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations are non gaap financial measures we define ebitda from continuing operations a non gaap financial measure as net income or loss plus interest expense minus interest income plus income taxes discontinued operations and depreciation and amortization from continuing operations we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as ebitda from continuing operations plus any pension and other post employment benefit opeb plan expenses impairments rationalization related charges initial public offering expenses acquisition and proxy contest costs non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar related party tax receivable agreement expense stock based compensation and non cash fixed asset write offs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is the primary metric used by our management and our board of directors to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we monitor adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplement to our gaap measures and believe it is useful to present to investors because we believe that it facilitates evaluation of our period to period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature allowing comparison of our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods unaffected by differences in capital structure capital investment cycles and fixed asset base in addition we believe adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and similar measures are widely used by investors securities analysts ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities we also monitor and present to investors the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations because we believe it is a useful and widely used way to assess our leverage our use of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments including any capital expenditures to augment or replace our capital assets adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect expenses relating to our pension and opeb plans adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect impairment of long lived assets and goodwill adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect initial public offering expenses or acquisition and proxy contest costs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect related party tax receivable agreement expenses adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect rationalization related charges stock based compensation or the non cash write off of fixed assets and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure in evaluating ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the reconciliation presented below our presentations of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be construed as suggesting that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non recurring items when evaluating our performance you should consider ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations alongside other financial

after the synchronised global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the us started to experience slowdowns worries about us inflation the us federal reserve s policy trajectory trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronised global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions to be sure the year started with a rally in risky assets us and global equities after the bloodbath of the last quarter of 2018 when worries about fed interest rate increases and about chinese and us growth tanked many markets since then the fed has pivoted toward renewed dovishness the us has maintained solid growth and china s macroeconomic easing has shown some promise of containing the slowdown there whether these relatively positive conditions last will depend on many factors the first thing to consider is the fed markets are pricing in the fed s monetary policy pause for the entire year but the us labour market remains robust were wages to accelerate and produce even moderate inflation above 2 fears of at least two more rate rises this year would return possibly shocking markets and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that in turn will revive concerns about us growth second as the slowdown in china continues the government s current mix of modest monetary credit and fiscal stimulus could prove inadequate given the lack of private sector confidence and high levels of overcapacity and leverage if worries about a chinese slowdown resurface markets could be severely affected on the other hand a stabilisation of growth would duly renew market confidence a related factor is trade while an escalation of the sino american conflict would hinder global growth a continuation of the current truce via a deal on trade would reassure markets even as the two countries geopolitical and technology rivalry continues to build over time fourth the eurozone is slowing down and it remains to be seen whether it is heading toward lower potential growth or something worse the outcome will be determined both by national level variables such as political developments in france italy and germany and broader regional and global factors obviously a hard brexit would negatively affect business and investor confidence in the uk and the european union alike the us president donald trump extending his trade war to the european automotive sector would severely undercut growth across the eu not only in germany finally much will depend on how eurosceptic parties fare in the european parliament elections this may and that in turn will add to the uncertainties surrounding european central bank president mario draghi s successor and the future of eurozone monetary policy fifth dysfunctional domestic politics in the us could add to uncertainties globally the recent government shutdown suggests that every upcoming negotiation over the budget and the debt ceiling will turn into a partisan war of attrition an expected report from the special counsel robert mueller may or may not lead to impeachment proceedings against trump and by the end of the year the fiscal stimulus from the republican tax cuts will become a fiscal drag possibly weakening growth sixth equity markets in the us and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker us earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction cannot be ruled out seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the us a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by opec countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken us stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the us or china higher us inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy wasn t constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already under way and usually with a significant lag there may be enough positive factors to make this a relatively decent if mediocre year for the global economy but if some of the negative scenarios outlined above materialise the synchronised slowdown of 2019 could lead to a global growth stall and sharp market downturn in 2020 nouriel roubini a professor at nyu s stern school of business and ceo of roubini macro associates was senior economist for international affairs in the white house s council of economic advisers during the clinton administration he has worked for the international monetary fund the us federal reserve and the world bank project syndicate

viad com now i ll turn the call over to steve steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thank you for joining us on today s call we are delivered fourth quarter revenue growth of 7 1 that exceeded the high end of our prior guidance range our adjusted segment ebitda improved by 7 2 million versus the 2017 fourth quarter the higher than expected revenue was driven by ges although we did see strong throughput on the year over year revenue increase it was lower than we previously anticipated primarily due to the mix of revenue at ges ges had some real bright spots during the quarter like strong growth in our revenue from corporate clients but there are also areas where we missed our margin expectation in some cases due to external factors like labor supply and medical claims in other cases where quite frankly we had missed opportunities and could have delivered better results for the full year our consolidated revenue was essentially flat to 2017 as growth at pursuit and favorable exchange rate variances were offset by expected negative show rotation at ges at ges we continue to strengthen our product and service offerings as we strive to become the preferred global full service provider for live events our award winning services are some of the most comprehensive in the industry and we continue to see more clients select us for an expanded array of services in addition to the increased scope of work our engagement with clients is moving up the value change as increasingly we are participating in strategy and planning discussions one of the major themes emerging in our space is the need to drive engaging an immersive experiences that events with an enhanced set of offering and our global reach our teams are delivering unique and seamless experiences for some of the world s leading show organizers and corporate brands one such example is our engagement with northwestern mutual following our successful work for its annual meeting last year the client expanded our relationship to include a multi event program consisting of event strategy audiovisual and production services in another instance we were appointed as a general service contractor for the 2019 occurrence of sibos a global financial services networking event through a competitive tender process our global reach in great track record producing sibos in north america enabled us to secure the 2019 event in london this september we also continue to gain traction and build market awareness with corporate brand marketers we re already working with some leading corporate brands like tableau mary kay dell and janus and for 2019 we ve already won three corporate clients inaudible a leading medical device company and genesis for inaudible we will be providing strategic consulting creative exhibit design and build and logistics movement management services for domestic exhibition program as well as its private client events and for the medical device company we will be providing similar services for a 12 show programs supporting its emergency health division in both cases we were chosen based on our global capabilities creative insight and innovative technology platform for genesis we will be delivering a multi city corporate event program aimed at training it s sales force on the highlights of its newly launched in g70 during this 13 city tour we will be providing audio and video production for the general sessions and breakout rooms as well as high end audiovisual equipment for the registration area corporate events represent a large and important market opportunity for us and we continue to focus on leveraging our existing capabilities and making smart investments to drive growth at an accelerated pace one of the key investments we made to facilitate growth in corporate events was the acquisition of audiovisual production service provider on services with av services representing about 50 of the total spend at a corporate event having this offering in house has strengthened our value proposition with current and prospective clients and while we are realizing the benefits of this acquisition as it relates to corporate event market share gains we still have some work to do to maximize the opportunities it presents more specifically we are getting better at capacity planning across the u s to ensure we re able to deploy the right equipment in the right place at the right time to minimize the cost of cross rentals we re accomplishing this through system integration and expansion of our asset base historically on services has held a strong footprint in the southeast last year we established a west coast presence by securing a contract to be the in house provider at the san diego convention center and in its next few months we will be opening a new facility in phoenix that will enable us to more efficiently service events in las vegas and other western cities additionally we re aligning our av sales team against the best live event opportunities for our company as a whole this means moving away from live entertainment projects which historically have accounted for a portion of on services revenue to enable an even greater focus on corporate events and conferences where we can more effectively leverage our full suite of services overall we ve made good progress against our growth strategy this year as we enter another year where we are facing negative show rotation we are sharply focused on driving productivity gains while we continue to selectively invest in key areas that will accelerate our growth in the corporate events and expand our relationship with existing clients now switching gears to pursuit pursuit delivered strong financial performance during 2018 while also undertaking numerous growth projects that will come online later this year for the full year organic revenue grew a solid 7 6 despite the impact of forest fires that hurt park visitation during our peak season our team did an excellent job of leveraging our recent refresh investments to drive growth and profitability through revenue management initiatives across our attractions and hospitality assets our key performance indicators improved year over year we realized an increase in samestore revenue per passenger of 7 7 at our attractions driven both by a higher effective ticket price as well as increased revenue from our food and beverage and retail offerings our hospitality assets also performed well with same store revpar growth of 2 9 which does not include our recently refreshed mount royal hotel that opened in july of 2018 i m pleased to report that guest feedback and reviews for the mount royal hotel have been extremely favorable and the property is already listed as the number two most popular hotel in the banff market according to tripadvisor in addition we have realized significantly higher revpar which was up nearly 30 compared to its prerenovation performance during the same period in 2016 pursuit strong performance this year is a testament to our refresh build buy strategy and revenue management initiatives which continue to add scale to the business while driving higher returns and continued support of our strategy we have many projects under way across pursuit s various collections that will accelerate our growth in 2019 and beyond in the alaska collection we are preparing to open 36 additional rooms this season at the seward windsong lodge which increases our bed base near our popular kenai fjords boat tour attraction in the glacier collection we are in the final stretches of constructing a new rv park cabin village in west glacier that will open in july this rv park is ideally situated at the west entrance of glacier national park and adjacent to our existing amenities in west glacier which include various dining and retail outlets in the banff jasper collection we have a number of refresh projects taking place primarily in the jasper market one is the reimagining of our 32 room glacier view inn at the columbia icefield which will be rebranded and renovated to provide a premium all inclusive hospitality experience our overnight guest will enjoy exclusive activities at our nearby glacier adventure and glacier skywalk attraction along with unique dining experiences and entertainment further north in jasper near our maligne lake boat tour attraction we are investing to upgrade our food and beverage offering at both maligne canyon and maligne lake the new maligne canyon wilderness kitchen will offer a new smoke house inspired menu with views of the scenic maligne river and at the maligne lake chalet we will be introducing a fantastic new indoor and outdoor dining space for guests to enjoy a special meal or cocktail with incredible view of picturesque mount maligne lake finally in flyover in the flyover collection we are under way with some great improvements to the exterior structure of flyover canada with the prime location at the end of canada place peer at downtown vancouver we re making improvements to provide a better sense of arrival for our guests along with the addition of new dining and retail space additionally our new flyover iceland attraction is on track to open this summer with the film footage captured and construction almost complete we are excited to unveil this fantastic new attraction the building looks stunning and it s already getting great feedback to the local community and press we look forward to replicating the success we had at the flyover canada in summary it was a strong year of progress against our strategy at pursuit and with multiple growth drivers in place we are looking forward to an even better year in 2019 and we continue to actively pursue additional organic growth projects and acquisitions to continue to scale pursuit s high margin collection of iconic experiences and now i ll turn it over to ellen to provide more color on our financials ellen ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer thank steve for the fourth quarter we posted a loss before other items of 0 09 per share on revenue of 296 9 million adjusted segment ebitda of 16 5 million and adjusted segment operating income of 4 1 million as steve mentioned earlier these results were better than prior year reflecting stronger financial results from both business units ges posted fourth quarter revenue of 281 8 million adjusted segment ebitda of 17 9 million and adjusted segment operating income of 8 9 million revenue growth came in stronger than we anticipated as compared to the 2017 fourth quarter revenue was up 18 8 million on an organic basis which excludes the impact of unfavorable exchange rate variances the revenue increase was 20 6 million or 7 8 the growth in revenue is primarily due to positive share rotation of about 8 million increased revenue for our corporate clients same store growth and new business wins ges s adjusted segment ebitda and adjusted segment operating income increased by 6 3 million and 6 6 million respectively from the 2017 fourth quarter these improvements primarily reflect higher revenue and lower performance based incentives pursuit posted fourth quarter revenue of 15 2 million adjusted segment ebitda of negative 1 4 million and adjusted segment operating loss of 4 7 million during a seasonally slow fourth quarter as compared to the 2017 fourth quarter revenue was up 870 000 the organic revenue increase which excludes unfavorable exchange rate variances was 1 4 million or 10 driven mainly by the reopening of the mount royal hotel as well as our revenue management and refresh efforts pursuit fourth quarter adjusted segment ebitda improved by 1 million on an organic basis and adjusted segment operating results increased by 825 000 also on an organic basis these results primarily reflects strong flow through on the revenue growth we realized during the quarter for the full year our income before other items was 2 34 per share on revenue of 1 3 billion adjusted segment ebitda was 146 3 million and adjusted segment operating income was 89 7 million as compared to 2017 our consolidated full year revenue decreased 10 8 million or 0 8 adjusted segment ebitda decreased by 7 9 million and adjusted segment operating income decreased by 9 6 million these declines were primarily driven by negative show rotation revenue at ges now moving on to the business group results ges posted full year revenue of 1 1 billion adjusted segment ebitda of 77 7 million and adjusted segment operating income of 39 8 million as compared to 2017 revenue declined 22 2 million or 29 9 million on an organic basis which excludes the impact of favorable exchange rate variances u s segment organic revenue decreased 24 9 million or 2 9 driven by negative show rotation revenue of about 27 million we also realized 22 8 growth in our u s based same show revenue which represented 33 8 of u s revenue during the year organic revenue for ges s international segment decreased 9 3 million or 3 3 primarily due to negative show rotation of approximately 8 million ges is adjusted segment ebitda and adjusted segment operating income decreased 10 5 million and 11 1 million respectively from 2017 these declines were primarily driven by lower revenue partially offset by a reduction in performance based incentives additionally ges s 2017 results included non recurring income of 2 8 million related to a contract settlement pursuit posted full year revenue of 185 3 million adjusted segment ebitda of 68 6 million and adjusted segment operating income of 49 9 million as compared to 2017 revenue increased 11 4 million the organic revenue increase which excludes unfavorable exchange rate variances was 13 3 million or 7 6 driven mainly by growth from our attraction and hospitality assets through a combination of our revenue management efforts and investments to enhance the guest experience our mount royal hotel which reopened in july after being closed due to fire damage in december 2016 contributed incremental revenue of about 4 million as steve mentioned earlier we are realizing much higher revpar at the mount royal hotel as compared to its pre renovation state with very positive guest reviews pursuit s adjusted segment ebitda increased by 4 2 million on an organic basis primarily due to higher revenue adjusted segment operating income increased by 3 1 million on an organic basis reflecting higher depreciation expense primarily related to reconstruction of the mount royal hotel now i ll cover some cash flow and balance sheet items before discussing 2019 guidance viad s full year consolidated cash flow from operations was 87 million versus 112 2 million in 2017 the decline was primarily due to changes in working capital capital expenditures totaled 85 5 million up from 56 6 in 2017 primarily due to investments at pursuit including the development of flyover iceland the construction of the west glacier rv park and the rebuilding of the mount royal hotel we repurchased approximately 340 00 shares during 18 including approximately 165 000 shares during the fourth quarter the aggregate full year purchase price was 17 2 million which is an average of 50 44 per share also our board of directors authorized repurchase of an additional 500 000 shares bringing our total authorization to about 600 000 shares well high return growth investments remain our first priority for capital allocation this additional share repurchase authorization will enable us to continue to opportunistically buyback our stock at attractive valuation at december 31st our cash and cash equivalents totaled 44 9 million our debt was 232 4 million and our debt to capital ratio was 34 now moving on to guidance for the first quarter we re expecting a loss per share of 0 75 to 0 85 as compared to a loss before other items of 0 49 in the 2018 quarter this change primarily reflects negative show rotation at ges as well as higher performance based incentive expense and additional resources to drive growth and profitability and high value areas within ges and pursuit for ges we expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of 260 million to 270 million as compared to 267 7 million in the 2018 quarter we expect a revenue headwind of about 8 million from the combination of show rotation and exchange rate variances to be at least partially offset by same show growth and new business wins we expect ges adjusted segment operating income to decrease by approximately 2 million to 4 million reflecting higher performance based incentive expense and additional resources to drive growth and profitability and high value areas for pursuit we expect revenue to be essentially flat to up about 2 million during a seasonally slow first quarter with the decline in adjusted segment operating results of about 2 million to 4 million the larger operating loss primarily reflects additional depreciation expense of about 2 million and additional costs to support continued growth of the business as well as the timing of certain expenses for the full year 2019 we expect consolidated revenue to increase at a mid single digit rate from 2018 with an increase in adjusted segment ebitda of approximately 6 million to 12 million depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase by 3 million to 5 million primarily as a result of the reopening of the mount royal hotel and other capital investments to support growth and efficiency gains adjusted segment operating income is expected to be in the range of 92 million to 98 million as compared to 89 7 million in 2018 our guidance assume exchange rates of 0 77 for the canadian dollar and 1 30 for the british pound based on this rates exchange rate variances versus 2018 are expected to have a negative impact of about 5 million on consolidated revenue a positive impact of about 500 000 on adjusted segment operating income and a positive impact on income per share of about 0 01 a 0 01 change in the canadian dollar would affect our full year revenue by about 2 5 million and a 0 01 change in the british pound would affect our full year revenue by about 1 5 million at ges full year revenue is expected to increase at a low single digit rate from 2018 with comparable ebitda we expect to continued same show growth and new business wins to offset an expected revenue headwind of about 30 million from the combination of share rotation and exchange rate variances at pursuit we expect full year revenue to grow by 15 to 17 from 2018 with an increase in adjusted segment ebitda of about 7 5 million to 10 5 million this guidance includes approximately 15 million to 17 million of new revenue from various investments we are making such as the development of the flyover iceland attraction and the west glacier rv park and the renovations of other assets that steve discussed earlier on a same store basis we expect pursuit revenue to grow at a mid single digit rate reflecting our ongoing revenue management efforts additionally i want to point out the start up costs related to the development of our flyover iceland attraction which is expected to open this summer are not included in these guidance ranges flyover iceland start up costs are expected to approximate 1 million during 2019 and will be excluded from our adjusted segment ebitda adjusted segment operating income and income before other items we expect our full year cash flow from operations to be in the range of 110 million to 120 million and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 75 million to 80 million which includes approximately 30 million of growth capex at pursuit and about 10 million of growth capex at ges additional 2019 guidance can be found in the earnings press release and one final item i wanted to touch on before i turn it back to steve is the status of our negotiations with the chicago teamsters we are currently working with union leadership to finalize the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement that includes the withdrawal from the central states pension plans this defined benefit pension plan has been designated under the pension protection act as being in critical and declining funding status we and the chicago teamsters union leadership believe it is in our collective best interest to withdraw from the central states plan and redirect future pension contributions to a new plan we are still working our way through the complexities of this transition assuming the withdrawal takes place it will trigger a withdrawal liability that is currently estimated at a net present value of approximately 14 million payable over the next 20 years and with that i ll turn it back to steve steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks ellen in closing we have some real bright spots in 2018 as well as some areas that didn t go as well as we wanted ges had some revenue visibility challenges with short term bookings that came up lower than expected in the third quarter but finished the year strong finish the year with a strong fourth quarter revenue growth pursuit was pacing for a very strong 2018 until heavy smoke from forest fires hampered visitation during the peak season nonetheless pursuit delivered 7 6 organic growth i m proud of our team for their great efforts during 2018 to overcome challenges and stayed focused on our key opportunities both business groups continue to make progress toward our strategic goals during 2018 and focused on expanding our offering to accelerate our future growth and profitability there are many positive changes we are driving in both business units and we re excited about our prospects for 2019 pursuit s growth will be amplified but the various investments we ve been making and continue to make to expand and enhance our collection of experiences at ges we continue to align our resources against key growth areas while also focusing on margin improvement actions additionally we have a solid pipeline of acquisitions and new growth opportunities that we are actively pursuing i want to thank the entire viad team for their dedication to driving long term shareholder values i m confident in our strategy and i m excited about the many opportunities that lie ahead for our company and with that let s open up the call for questions niki can you please open the call questions and answers operator thank you very much sir and absolutely now we will begin the question and answer session operator instruction our first question comes from the line of pablo o connor ph your line is open pablo o connor analyst hi how are you doing today steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges good how are you doing pablo pablo o connor analyst good i just wanted to have a couple of follow up questions about the pursuit business so earlier this year there was the government shutdown and the national parks were affected by that did you guys see any negative effect on pursuit s because of the government shutdown that happened and may happen in a few days steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yes faisel right now in the u s market we re near national parks those national parks are closed for the season and they won t be reopening until later this spring so we were not immediately impacted by the government shutdown that happened in january and we ll have to see what happens or how long if there is another government shutdown pablo o connor analyst okay and for the ges a few days ago i saw numbers that the number of attendance to show has been decreasing for the last few quarters and it may continue decreasing throughout the year so i was wondering what s what do you think of that s going to have a negative impact on the show rotation and shows in the upcoming years in 2019 and 2020 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges well i think the there are some fluctuation around the attendance numbers for some key shares that take place every year fortunately our revenue is more tied to the size of the event so what s most important to us is the net square footage of the events that take place that s more there is a stronger correlation to our revenue based on the next square footage so while we think the attendance number is important a more important number for our business is really the size of the event pablo o connor analyst okay and as i remember you guys were direct a few acquisitions to increase margins like to provide additional services to the shows are you planning on any additional acquisition this upcoming year continue to drive margin in the ges business steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yes faisel we continue to have an active pipeline of m a as well as organic growth opportunities for both businesses really on the ges side it is geared more toward higher margin services that really round out our comprehensive suite of services focused both on show organizer and corporate marketers so yes we will continue to look at opportunity that we have in our pipeline for both businesses pablo o connor analyst okay perfect thank you steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks pablo operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tyler batory your line is open tyler batory janney montgomery analyst thank you good afternoon everyone few questions from me first just wanted to touch on guidance and steve i appreciate the commentary on the cost side of things and ges in the fourth quarter but you talk a little bit more about your expectations on a cost side of things in that business for 2019 i mean you highlighted few of the issues and we re not going on in the fourth quarter i mean do you think you can make some improvements on those you kind of rolling forward some of that into next year steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges no tyler thanks for the question we can make improvements and we anticipate making improvements on some of those issues that we experienced in the fourth quarter some of them were one time issues around labor availability and some medical claims and things like that it s in our plans to do better than we did in the fourth quarter and so we think that we can overcome some of those challenges that we had tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay great and then on the pursuit side of things looking at 2019 if i can do the math at the midpoint looks like you guys are going to margin down year over year can you talk little bit about what you re seeing on the cost side there and obviously you have some new projects ramping up other incremental start up cost that are associated with some of those steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges there are so in 2019 obviously we re bringing on some new experiences whether that s flyover canada i m sorry flyover iceland or some of the renovation projects that we have so those are starting in the year we think that there are some start up costs associated with those that may impact full year numbers but again we see strong returns from the investments we re making on the pursuit side of the business ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer and i guess what just mentioned to that with the mount royal hotel it didn t open until july so the first half of the year we had business interruption proceeds so we had essentially operating income with no revenue that affected the margin a bit as well higher in 18 tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay got it that s helpful and then i wanted to ask about what you guys said about the same show growth i mean if you re looking at low single digits for 19 i think in the past you had talked about mid single digits can you talk a little bit about what s going on with the delta there and maybe generally what you re what you re seeing in the industry steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yeah we are guiding toward low single digits for 2019 on previous calls we ve talked about a couple of industries that have seen lower than expected growth specifically in retail and in the auto industry and we believe that those trends will continue going into 2019 but we see it captured within those few industries and not an overall market decline tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay got it and then maybe the last one from me you obviously the short term bookings seem to be an issue in the third quarter you talked about some strengths in the fourth quarter on that is that continued here into into 2019 i think in the past you talked about 2019 being a fresh start with respect to those is that still something that you re expecting steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yeah every year is a fresh start with some of our short term bookings because those are projects that are not contracted before you enter into the year so we had some visibility issues between q3 and q4 on short term bookings i m happy where we ended up on a full year basis but we need to get better at the visibility of what that revenue looks like in our forecasting tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay great that s all from me thank you steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks tyler operator thank you our next question comes from the line of marco rodriguez your line is open marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst good afternoon guys thank you for taking my questions steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges hi marco marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst hey wanted to start on ges you re a little bit maybe if you can talk a little bit more on the on the corporate events and the av side of things you made mentioned that obviously your strategy is pushing more toward that type of revenue for margin expansion maybe if you can talk about more specifics as far as what sort of strategic initiatives or sales and marketing efforts you might have in place for our fiscal 19 to drive those areas steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges we talked a little bit about the new brands that we re bringing on in 2019 promote from a corporate branding perspective so we feel like we have some good growth in our sales initiatives and the way we are aligning our sales team to go after those opportunities from a margin perspective i highlighted during the call that we are opening up a audiovisual office on the west coast here in phoenix and that will really help us lower our cost of executing projects for our clients i think during the call i also mentioned in historically we ve been located primarily in the southeast and so our transportation costs and our equipment being out of inventory for longer periods when we do projects on the west coast was always hurting our margins this will allow us to improve that margin additionally marco i would add that in addition to having kind of our sales aligned and how during some activity to improve the margins of that business we re also adding resources in areas that we think will help grow our sales and that s around the creative support analytics and insights support that really will help us work hand in hand with our client our corporate clients in their strategy in the planning for their events marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst understood and that kind of brings up the next question you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that i guess recently or maybe this fiscal year you started to get involved in more planning and strategy discussions with your clients i would have assumed that there would have been some level of discussion prior to this but it kind of sounds like this is becoming a bigger thing and hence a better driver of revenue and our margin for you guys can you talk a little bit more about that and what sort of changing there steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges sure as part of our growth strategy that we ve had in place now for several years our goal is always been to move further upstream and get closer to our clients as they perform their strategy of how to activate their brands and how to bring their brands to life whether that s at a trade show or at a corporate event we ve made a number of acquisitions and other internal investments in order to position ourselves to really have those conversations what we re highlighting now is we re really seeing that really come to fruition where we are in with our clients discussing how to activate their brands where is the best return for their money with the audiences that they have so i m excited about the progress we ve made i don t want to make it sound like it s been a one year light switch this has been something that we ve been working at for a while and we felt like it was important to to talk about it today because we have seen an improvement in it marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it last quick question here on pursuit you had mentioned an incremental 15 million to 17 million in fiscal 19 from the refresh build buy type strategy obviously there are some new properties you have coming online here in fiscal 19 you also identified some refresh opportunities as well could you maybe kind of rank the projects from top to bottom there in terms of their impact on that 15 million to 17 million incremental revenue for 19 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges i think there are a number of projects in there as we ve talked about through the call they re all meaningful size projects i don t know if i have a specific ranking that would be able to share with you i think what s more important is that we re across all of them we re delivering a consistent guest experience that s elevated from where we ve been in the past and that s going to help us and that s going to help us in the overall markets that we serve i think one of our largest investments market would be really the flyover iceland experience so if i had to give you a number one i think iceland would probably be the the largest investment we made with return additionally i would add that put a lot of money into projects that are around the jasper area so again you look at the glacier view inn renovation which is now going to be the glacier view launch as well as the the maligne canyon projects those collectively are also a strong return for us and high high expectations marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it thanks a lot i appreciate your time steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve o hara your line is open stephen o hara sidoti company analyst yeah hi good afternoon steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges hi steve stephen o hara sidoti company analyst thanks for taking the question can you just talk about not sure if you mentioned this but in terms of the growth expected within pursuit how much of that is the new projects versus you know maybe improve visitation and then kind of if you had kind of the deficit last year would be forest fires what are you expecting this year in terms of i guess what s organic versus maybe the catch up from last year and the new projects steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges well i think we ve outlined that the new projects we believe will drive somewhere between 15 million and 17 million of revenue in 2019 so the other pieces there s combinations of whether it s not having the forest fires in 2019 and increased visitation or our revenue management we believe that it will be in the mid single digit organic growth so steve i guess to answer your question you have mid organic mid single digit organic growth and on top of that you have some of these refreshed projects or build projects like the flyover iceland adding somewhere between 15 and 17 million of revenue also ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer and just one further point i m going to add steve and kind of going back to the prior question that marco had flyover iceland is one of the premier projects the 19th impact on ebitda is not going to be it s mid year it s not going to be a high impact project but it is a big revenue driver and there s many other projects in there like the seward windsong lodge the rv park i mean there s a lot of projects that will contribute to the ebitda of 19 i just to wanted to clarify that steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks ellen stephen o hara sidoti company analyst okay thank you and then just it just is 2019 kind of the trough year it looks like i don t think any of the major shows happened in 2019 and i m just wondering what the last year that may be look like this was i think it s 2015 but maybe i m wrong there and i mean it looks like you ve had very in terms of versus 2015 i mean you have much better earnings performance it looks like expect to grow 2019 versus kind of the previous trough year and i know there has been acquisitions things like that but do you feel like you re i guess first is that trough idea correct and then if you can talk about maybe the what you ve done to kind of make it less kind of volatile in terms of the impact in these shows year to year steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yes thanks steve so you re correct we the large non annual shows do not occur in 2019 as you remember they set up on either a two or three or in every four year cycle depending on the show which means they actually all will occur in 2020 but they did not occur in 2019 a similar year is 2015 when there is similar dynamics and our business has changed a lot from 2015 to 2019 there been a number of initiatives whether it s some of the acquisitions that we ve made over that time period whether it s some of the structural changes we ve made to how we service our clients to lower our cost basis so there s been a number of changes but the comparison is an accurate one between 15 and 19 stephen o hara sidoti company analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jamie yackow your line is open jamie yackow moab partners analyst hey guys good afternoon steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges hi jamie jamie yackow moab partners analyst just a couple from me can you guys i may have missed it but can you give us a little more detail on the growth capex for each of the segments for 2019 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges sure we describe it ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer i don t just one second jamie if you have another question you can go to that and i can come back to you jamie yackow moab partners analyst sure yeah i guess i m just wondering can you give us an update on the share repurchase activity in 2019 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges so we have a new authorization that i talked about and we will be the same kind of strategy that we have inaudible growth but we will opportunistically do share repurchases and now we have the authority to do that we were running low as we start toward the end of last year so now we have about 600 000 jamie yackow moab partners analyst right have you guys been actively in the market or as have you not repurchased any share part of it ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer well we haven t repurchased what we repurchased in the fourth quarter was it because then the fy period started so we have not repurchased in 19 yet but we did repurchased in the fourth quarter 165 000 shares and then back to the growth capex i think we talked about lot of them but it s flyover iceland it s the maligne lake and canyon snb ph the rv park the seward windsong lodge expansion the glacier view lodge renovation as another one i think jamie yackow moab partners analyst wasn t that majority of that those dollars spent in 2018 now or other projects that ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer no that will be about 20 million in capital in 19 yes some of them happened started yes for sure but they continue into 19 jamie yackow moab partners analyst okay and on the ges side steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges on the ges side you have some investments around lowering our cost of fabrication so we re opening a fabrication facility in poland which will enable our emea team to provide exhibit building in fabrication at a significantly lower cost and what we re doing today we re also there some capital put toward the phoenix office for on services again to lower our fulfillment cost and lower cross rentals there s a major project around facility consolidation in las vegas where we will be combining two facilities into one of our existing facilities and there s a number of other projects that we re doing that will allow us to lower the cost of executing some of our shows by simplifying simplifying some of the organizer elements things like counters and entrance units jamie yackow moab partners analyst got it and then i guess just lastly the 1 same show growth seemed a little light relative to where you guys have been running was there anything unusual one show that maybe was a little weaker and if anything kind of point to steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges sure there is a single show it s an auto shows and it s kind of what we ve talked about it and our q3 remarks that we saw the softness around this one event if you pull that out you re in the roughly 3 same show growth range jamie yackow moab partners analyst got it all right great thanks thanks guys steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks jamie ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer thank you operator thank you at this time we don t have any questions on queue operator instructions there are no incoming questions speakers you may continue steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges all right thanks niki thanks for your questions and your

china steps up efforts to close failed zombie companies by 2020 but faces harsh economic reality plans to liquidate china s thousands of zombie companies are underway in several of its provinces according to state media as the government moves towards an aggressive target of eliminating such firms by 2020 in december the chinese government set a goal of closing zombie state owned enterprises by the end of 2020 on february 1 the economic information daily a newspaper owned by the xinhua news agency reported that various arms of the government including regional authorities and the state owned assets supervision and administration commission sasac the body that oversees all state assets are moving forward with liquidation plans in regions including hebei heilongjiang henan and shaanxi closing thousands of such companies consistently unprofitable firms that remain in operation only because of government subsidies or regular loans from state owned banks in less than two years would be an extremely ambitious undertaking in a strong economic environment but doing so in the midst of an economic slowdown exacerbated by the ongoing trade war with the united states raises questions as to how much the chinese government can actually accomplish china s economy is growing at its lowest rate for three decades but analysts have warned that unless it addresses issues of debt and inefficiency the slump will be prolonged reducing the number of zombie companies could improve the efficiency of the economy in a number of ways closing unprofitable firms in industries with excess production capacity such as the steel sector would support prices and profits while easing tensions with trading partners it would also allow investment to shift to more productive uses in both the public and private sectors improving the country s longer term growth outlook and it would help address the us complaint that chinese government subsidies distort the domestic market giving chinese companies an unfair advantage over international counterparts however the closing of thousands of these companies could dramatically increase unemployment at a time when joblessness is already on the rise it is unclear if the services sector would be able to produce enough new jobs to absorb these laid off industrial workers the disposal of state owned zombie enterprises is closely related to the core tasks of supply side structural reform such as reducing excess capacity and deleveraging excess debt and risky lending said chen dafei senior financial analyst at shanghai based investment bank orient securities the risk associated with state owned enterprises is unemployment but a bigger risk with the move is that it will mistakenly hurt small and medium sized private enterprises chen warned zombie companies in china s heavy industries are serviced by networks of smaller firms supplying everything from equipment to food services to transport if the zombie company is closed many of these small business would go bust with further consequences for employment chen said with beijing prioritising job growth as a means of maintaining social stability the government could reasonably be expected to take a go slow approach to closing zombie firms which would be counter to the ambitious target of closing them by 2020 in the past sasac has merged zombie firms with healthy state owned companies in a bid to avoid spikes in unemployment however this risks eroding the finances of the healthy firm this is not a new problem for china s authorities the dangers of zombie firms are well known reform of this part of the economy is at the core of the government s state sector structural reform effort until last summer that effort had been moving forward led by government campaigns to reduce excess industrial capacity and cut back on pollution the start of the trade war and the subsequent slowdown in the economy however sidelined those efforts as the government s focus shifted to stabilising economic growth recently though addressing the problem has re emerged as a top priority a december meeting between 11 top chinese government bodies including the national development and reform commission the powerful planning agency and the people s bank of china the central bank resulted in the 2020 pledge with a list of zombie companies to be closed set to be published within three months this message was reinforced from the very top last month must increase our efforts to appropriately handle the problems associated with zombie companies chinese president xi jinping said in a speech on january 22 china has reduced its excess steel production capacity by around 150 million tonnes some provinces still have a further 20 million tonnes to cut so we will urge these provinces to accelerate the process miao wei the minister of industry and information technology said in a press conference on january 29 in carrying out this mandate however government agencies face the challenges of a moving target both in relation to the number of zombie companies there are and the amount of debt they hold sasac s most recent data showed that there were 2 041 central government run zombie companies still operating in early 2016 including zombie state owned enterprises overseen by local governments the total climbs above 10 000 however in a recent report on bankruptcies maxime lemerle head of sector and insolvency research at trade credit insurer euler hermes suggested that the total number of zombie state owned enterprises may exceed 20 000 cases according to some studies a report by china s renmin university in 2016 meanwhile listed the industries with the highest proportion of zombie companies as steel 51 43 per cent real estate 44 53 per cent and architecture 31 76 per cent through its deleveraging programme of the last two years china has made progress on stabilising its huge pile of corporate debt corporate debt as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp fell to 155 1 at the end of june 2018 from 157 1 at the end of march it was still well above the 93 1 per cent of gdp at the end of 2008 at the very start of the global financial crisis but the initiative to close the thousands of zombie companies in such a short period of time threatens to sharply reverse that progress elimination of zombie companies is a double edged sword said zhang yongjun deputy chief economist at the china centre for international economic exchanges a beijing based think tank on the one hand it will mean more efficient allocation of investment on the other hand a surge in insolvencies in a short period of time will definitely affect economic behaviour and market operations resulting in an increase in bad debt the international monetary fund imf using 2016 data calculated that zombie companies accounted for 9 per cent of china s total corporate debt however nicholas lardy senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington said the imf probably underestimates the share of zombie firms given the decline by two thirds in the average return on assets of state industrial companies between the pre global financial crisis period before 2008 and the 2016 data presented in the imf study it is surprising that the imf estimate of the share of zombie industrial companies in 2016 6 5 per cent was less than half that in the earlier period 15 per cent in 2005 07 lardy wrote in his new book the state strikes back the end of economic reform in china given that a large share of the losses of state firms is generated by firms in the service sector one would expect that the share of the total debt of all non financial corporations accounted for by all zombie firms would be substantially higher than the share of debt of industrial firms accounted for by zombie industrial firms the latest data from the ministry of finance shows that china s state owned enterprises had 115 64 trillion yuan us 17 14 trillion in total debt as of the end of december an increase of 8 1 from a year earlier source south china morning post
a look at the day ahead from european economics and politics editor mark john and emea markets editor sujata rao the views expressed are their own london feb 8 reuters between them the european union and labour s jeremy corbyn have essentially shown theresa may a way out of the brexit deadlock all she has to do is take on board the elements of a softer exit as set out in corbyn s letter this week eu officials told her yesterday they would be more than happy to tweak the future relationship bit of the brexit agreement to accommodate that and such a compromise stands more chance of winning the backing of a majority of uk parliamentarians than anything else mooted so far the main snag is that its proposal for a permanent uk eu customs union is a big red line for may it would prevent britain

with france will not be built as long as the 5 star movement is in office this came after france decided yesterday to pull its ambassador from italy following a series of verbal attacks on emmanuel macron by italian leaders you d think they would have better things to go the cost of insuring exposure to italy s sovereign debt and bonds issued by the country s banks jumped on thursday after the european commission slashed growth forecasts but both di maio and his coalition colleague and political rival matteo salvini seem to have decided that france bashing is a key part of their campaign strategy for european parliament elections expect plenty more before the vote in may finland s government has just released the first findings from a two year basic income trial that ended a month ago

the arab world needs a collective security architecture the u s project of a middle east strategic alliance mesa could in theory be a step forward especially as it links military security to political and economic security but so far mesa has been conceived to meet u s needs to target iran and to reduce u s regional presence without allowing china or russia to gain influence while disregarding the priorities and constraints of prospective arab member states u s and arab officials acknowledge that mesa is a collective work in progress another working group meeting on mesa is expected to take place later this month certain elements will be crucial to address if it is to happen and even more so if mesa is to succeed in building regional security rather than merely fueling the regional arms race what is mesa and why did the united states propose it mesa was first announced during u s president donald trump s visit to saudi arabia in may 2017 the riyadh declaration described the alliance as contributing to peace and security in the region and the world it will include all gulf cooperation council gcc states bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the uae as well as egypt jordan and the united states the idea revolves primarily around security but more recently it has adopted economic and political aspects as well it joins a rather crowded field of regional alliances that exist in practice or on paper or are still under consideration yasmine farouk yasmine farouk is a nonresident scholar in the middle east program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more yasfarouk such an alliance fits squarely within the thinking of not only the trump administration see for example the december 2017 national security strategy and 2018 national defense strategy but also the preceding administration of barack obama both articulated a desire to scale back the u s security posture in the middle east the defense strategy promotes expanding regional consultative mechanisms and deepen interoperability to share the burden of protecting u s allies and interests across the world in the middle east this strategy is compatible with trump s determination to reduce the u s contribution to regional security and make u s support strictly equivalent to what gulf countries pay from now on gulf countries will have to pay more to secure themselves and to reimburse in trump s word the united states for previous decades of protection the trump administration expects arab countries led by saudi arabia to continue controlling oil prices and to back u s policies against russia and china mesa was initially conceived to build gulf states capabilities to counter iran without intervention by the united states or russian or chinese intervention recently however state department officials have been trying to reshape it to reflect larger strategic objectives tim lenderking u s deputy assistant secretary of state for arabian gulf affairs indicated that the alliance would focus on iran cyber concerns attacks on infrastructure and coordinating conflict management from syria to yemen along with counterproliferation and counterterrorism and the foreign minister of bahrain sheikh khalid bin ahmed al khalifa has stated that mesa is not against anyone how does the united states envision mesa as time has passed u s officials have developed the mesa concept in a variety of ways that would allow the united states to reduce its military presence without losing clout in the region in addition to getting arab states to invest more in their own and each other s defenses u s officials will be trying to use mesa to push back against growing chinese and russian influence in the region including their support to iran the security pillar mesa seeks enhanced interoperability of member states defense systems probably through regional capabilities centers that would cover the maritime cyber air and missile domains as well as border security asymmetric warfare and command and control so far joint troops and an agreement like nato s article 5 are off the table according to the latest national defense strategy interoperability between allies entails operational concepts modular force elements communications information sharing and equipment that accelerate foreign partner modernization and ability to integrate with u s forces with u s training and systems mesa would allow members to rely on each other to fill national defense gaps the intended interoperability would certainly impose limits on the region s increasing arms purchases from european countries and most importantly russia and china this issue has become prominent in recent years saudi arabia and the uae have collaborated to fund non u s arms purchases for other arab armies china has sold ballistic missiles as well as armed drones to gulf countries and has established its first overseas military base in djibouti adjacent to u s military presence on strategic waterways arab states defense and security cooperation with russia comes at a time when russia s military and political presence in the middle east is encompassing washington s traditional allies egypt has always purchased russian arms but qatar the uae and saudi arabia may have exploited their potential purchase of russia s s 400 defense systems to extract advanced arms purchases from the united states the potential expansion of those systems beyond syria threatens u s access to and domination of airspace in the region in the words of general joseph votel commander of u s central command russia and china along with iran are increasingly competing to be the partner of choice militarily politically and economically with u s allies mesa would also allow u s control of end use violations of its arms especially violations that involve revealing u s technology to russia china north korea or those linked to the use of u s made arms against civilians the political pillar the mesa framework incorporates governance mechanisms and member states commitments to each other it would also provide member states with a mechanism for dispute resolution and a much needed platform to coordinate action during regional crises it would prevent the resulting vacuum that terrorists china or russia could otherwise fill the united states also counts on mesa s coordinated action to support its deal of the century in the israeli palestinian conflict and to implement a rapprochement with israel that could join mesa mesa countries have different assessments of how the intra gcc crisis qatar against the quartet of bahrain egypt saudi arabia and the uae affects mesa the qatari foreign minister stated that the real challenge facing the u s led alliance is to solve the gulf crisis the recent resignation of general anthony zinni the u s envoy tasked with resolving the gulf crisis and establishing mesa as well as u s secretary of state mike pompeo s recent statements seem to confirm the qatari view nevertheless the u s administration continues to pursue mesa the economic and energy pillars mesa s economic and energy pillars are far less noticed than the defense pillar mesa would boost trade and foreign direct investment between its members according to the foreign minister of bahrain in fact these pillars helped dilute mesa s political and military identity encouraging less wealthy and skeptical arab states to join through the economic pillar mesa becomes a venue to plan and coordinate regional economic development and energy sector integration with assistance from u s agencies such as the overseas private investment corporation opic the u s agency for international development usaid and the office of the u s trade representative ustr projects to reform connect and insulate energy markets in the region are a priority mesa would therefore challenge the rapidly growing chinese and russian investments and infrastructure projects in the region especially in the oil gas and nuclear energy sectors at the same time it would coordinate arab replacements of u s financial contributions to regional stabilization and assistance programs obstacles to mesa s success the alliance has gotten off to a slow start because prospective arab member states have varying levels of enthusiasm some widely shared reservations and challenges are listed below mesa lacks a convincing security framework beyond confronting iran some arab members do not agree that iran is an imminent danger nor do they agree on the best way to deal with it while u s saudi uae and bahraini statements express a need for mesa to confront iran egyptian jordanian and even qatari officials have publicly expressed reluctance kuwait and oman have not shown fervent support for mesa aside from saudi arabia bahrain and the uae no other country involved supports military action against iran kuwait qatar and oman preach and practice engagement with tehran instead of confrontation egypt and jordan tend not to oppose the u s and saudi discourse on mesa at least publicly in order to guarantee support for their regimes as well as access to benefits that may otherwise be out of reach arab states see mesa as primarily serving u s and saudi interests some regional partners are wary of establishing a new alliance instead of building the capacities of existing arab and gcc security mechanisms those mechanisms embrace a wider and more consensual vision on collective security that includes but goes beyond defense against iran mesa so far is u s made and is perceived by skeptical partners as an attempt to transform them into economic political and military tools rather than allies in the u s strategy against iran table 1 shows current collective security structures that reflect arab visions of collective security it also shows that gulf states have already made progress on the levels of interoperability and unified command within the gcc framework with support from the united states those endogenous collective mechanisms are largely ineffective yet representative of how far the gcc plus egypt and jordan are willing to go on collective defense as it stands today mesa embodies all the obstacles that continue to make those mechanisms ineffective chief among those obstacles is saudi domination of gulf security and defense policies something that gulf countries have been resisting for years yet with mesa this domination would henceforth have u s support mesa ignores domestic political drivers of instability the alliance does not incorporate threats inherent to the domestic and regional policies of the arab states involved this challenge makes mesa inconsistent with the u s goal of a middle east that is not a safe haven or breeding ground for jihadist terrorists according to the global terrorism index armed conflicts and high levels of political terror are the two main incubators of terrorism mesa members are involved in both according to the index political terror is defined as extra judicial killings torture or imprisonment without trial political terror sometimes carried out in the name of fighting terrorism is transforming some arab prisons into what professor hamed el said dubbed universities of terrorism where instead of being rehabilitated oppressed youth become radicalized meanwhile some mesa members support radical islamist actors against other members and across the region the trump administration s underestimation of the threats posed by such policies leads to a mistaken belief that more arms will bring more security and collective action that supports u s policies in the region this rationale was illustrated in pompeo s speech in cairo during his january 2019 tour of arab countries where no reference was made to such harmful arab policies within this context mesa comes as another example of u s support to arab regimes that makes the united states as well as its regional interests and allies a target of popular anger and terrorism al qaeda and the self proclaimed islamic state have shown that terrorist ideologies cannot be easily contained to small local pockets today terrorist networks have spread throughout the region into syria libya yemen egypt the horn of africa and all the way to the sahel ignoring the roots of political terror limits mesa s capacity to target iran s malign activities as pompeo described them tehran s destabilizing activities in bahrain and saudi arabia find fertile ground in the political religious and socioeconomic grievances of their shia communities u s lenience toward authoritarian regimes does not guarantee that arab states will return the favor by aligning with u s policies in the region especially if the united states is in retreat syria s restored relations with bahrain the uae and jordan illustrates this also this u s lenience is incompatible with other u s policies that threaten to inflame arab public opinions against any new alliance with the united states this is clearly the case in regards to the administration s israeli palestinian policy which is hardly supported by its arab allies articles in official arab press outlets about mesa are already negatively hinting that it is another u s project to push arab states into an alliance with israel recent saudi and egyptian actions to mitigate the domestic impact of warming relations with israel are proof that arab regimes are still wary of domestic public opinion on this issue this pushback hinders u s plans for israeli involvement with mesa joining mesa would also be hard to explain to the publics of the countries involved in the gcc rift where media campaigns have created profound popular hostility between the two sides arab states operating in regional conflicts under the banner of a u s led alliance also threatens to mobilize arab public opinions which are particularly sensitive to intra arab and intra muslim military interactions similar mobilizations occurred during the 1960s and current wars in yemen the 1991 gulf war the twenty nine years of syrian military presence in lebanon and arab countries contributions in 2003 to the u s led intervention in iraq most of those incidents spurred public hostility to the united states and israel and eventually turned into demonstrations against some incumbent arab regimes mesa suffers from expectation and confidence gaps all members have different expectations for the alliance in addition to confidence gaps with both each other and the united states arab states see mesa as primarily a military alliance and have responded accordingly skeptics see saudi arabia and the uae as more prone to addressing regional threats with military power risking escalation that could engage other mesa members egypt kuwait and jordan s limited military involvement in yemen is representative of this skepticism oman was never part of it in contrast saudi arabia intervened in yemen and bahrain threatened to intervene in qatar encouraged a military intervention in syria and has supported military action against iran the uae has joined the yemen intervention and is increasing its military presence in the horn of africa both saudi arabia and the uae are focused on enhancing their strategic autonomy which means less foreign control on the end use of their arms it is unclear why mesa would achieve a higher level of trust between its arab members and therefore a higher level of commitment beyond the current selective and verbal only engagement to gulf defense this issue is crucial given that the united states is leaving the region and thus cannot guarantee the outcome of new engagements mesa doesn t address the question of joint command and control even though this deficiency is the main reason all regional attempts at collective defense have been ineffective thus far arab members of mesa do not share the level of trust needed for information sharing that would make their maritime cyber air and missile defenses more interoperable than they already are specifically egypt saudi arabia and the uae are currently the three main contenders that do not trust each other for either command or control in fact various mesa members prevent their domestic national security institutions from working together to lower the chances of a coup until january 2018 the egyptian military establishment still judged that u s interoperability would infringe on egyptian national sovereignty the politicization of the egyptian military establishment the gulf s reservoir for ground troops is a constant source of distress to gulf countries inter arab military exercises and membership in international military coalitions still failed to establish the level of confidence needed for true operational interoperability and the standardization needed for real time collective defense that doesn t require u s command the region also has a long history of failed and bitter experiences the most relevant endogenous experience to mesa was the 1991 damascus declaration that capitalized on the momentum of the liberation of kuwait the project integrated economic and political pillars was coordinated with both the united states and iran and included syria but not jordan yet this promising structure was thwarted by arab gulf countries preference for u s over arab military protection leaving behind a sentiment of deception that is still present today on the economic level arab states also seem to be hesitant oman hosted a meeting on january 9 hailed by u s national security adviser john bolton about economic development and energy cooperation among the united states and middle east partners omani and other arab statements except for bahrain linked that meeting to the gcc rather than to mesa thus it is doubtful that mesa would produce any promising outcomes on the economic level the arab world remains unattractive to private investors because of its state organized economies corruption legal and regulatory constraints political instability socioeconomic deficiencies sanctions and the omnipresent threat of military conflicts those structural impediments require a vision for economic development that goes beyond regional economic growth built on optimizing rents all economic reports cite political decisions as the major impediment to regional economic cooperation moreover recent world bank reports indicate that gulf countries continue to use their sovereign wealth funds to secure domestic stability and to invest in emerging economies therefore those funds should not be considered as mesa resources in the energy sector u s projects are facing major challenges first the quartet boycotting qatar is determined to limit the consumption of qatari gas and to compete with it in the energy market second the u s congress is already preemptively blocking u s saudi cooperation on nuclear energy third the current crisis of confidence between u s and arab members does not encourage them to interrupt their politically and economically promising partnerships with fellow authoritarians russia and china fourth mesa will need to catch up with the evolving strategic dynamics in the eastern mediterranean s gas sector finally the united states will likely fail to include the control of oil prices in the transactional strategic bargain behind mesa the expectation that saudi arabia will control oil prices according to trump s demands has already proven to be wrong the kingdom s decision last month to lead an opec plus production cut to provide funds that sustain state spending on public acquiescence is a case in point in addition market dynamics and divisions within opec and gcc states will hinder any lasting commitment to low oil prices opec countries and russia are already concerned that u s oil production has surpassed their own with riyadh and moscow doubling down on their cooperation kuwait s reported position on chevron s role in the neutral fields and the uae s recent fdi legislation are yet more reminders that gulf countries will continue to consider oil as their lifeline and a matter of national sovereignty suggested changes for success changes could be made to mesa that would increase the alliance s chances of coming into existence and increase its ability to actually contribute to regional security instead of merely driving more arms purchases build on past or current efforts the united states should start by supporting existing efforts to build collective security mechanisms and a gcc interoperable ballistic missile defense architecture before advocating a new military alliance for collective defense on the military side the united states should dig into the lessons learned from centcom s combined maritime task forces and joint inter arab military exercises the importance of those experiences stems from increased arab interest in red sea security and the rotating command that allowed arab countries to lead joint operations the lessons learned can provide a good reference for u s expectations from any arab strategic alliance that the united states would not command address immediate sources of arab insecurity the resolution of the gcc rift must precede any talks about the establishment of a regional alliance the basis for this resolution must be a commitment from all countries to halt their meddling in the domestic affairs of each other and of all other arab states to uproot terrorism the trump administration must reverse its policy of lifting conditionality on arms purchases and link the benefits of mesa to what it dubs gradual reforms political education and socioeconomic reforms are the only way to achieve the administration s objective of security through stability in the middle east the united states must also guarantee that arab states will not use mesa related technology and weapons to silence opponents at home and abroad all arab mesa members must contribute to developing mesa s founding principles scope of action and objectives instead of just reacting to u s proposals if they do not contribute mesa will not gain momentum improve confidence between arab states and the united states the trump administration needs a more consistent middle east policy with consistent public statements as well as fewer abrupt decisions and changes in personnel u s decisions like withdrawing from syria and waiving iran oil sanctions are leading to a similar crisis of confidence that spoiled the obama administration s u s gcc strategic cooperation forum the united states has already shown its commitment to pursue mesa by holding technical meetings on its different pillars despite recent tensions in u s saudi relations in addition to the february 13 meeting in warsaw on the future of peace and security in the middle east the united states is also convening a meeting on mesa s political and security pillars the same month both meetings clearly overlap and the united states and its arab partners may discuss mesa on the sidelines of the warsaw meeting both meetings will provide indicators on whether the united states will work through these regional challenges to a robust security architecture or instead continue to overlook these obstacles correction the table has been updated to clarify the peninsula shield forces roles in 1986 and 1990 1991 conflicts

i ll turn the call over to steve steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thank you for joining us on today s call we are delivered fourth quarter revenue growth of 7 1 that exceeded the high end of our prior guidance range our adjusted segment ebitda improved by 7 2 million versus the 2017 fourth quarter the higher than expected revenue was driven by ges although we did see strong throughput on the year over year revenue increase it was lower than we previously anticipated primarily due to the mix of revenue at ges ges had some real bright spots during the quarter like strong growth in our revenue from corporate clients but there are also areas where we missed our margin expectation in some cases due to external factors like labor supply and medical claims in other cases where quite frankly we had missed opportunities and could have delivered better results for the full year our consolidated revenue was essentially flat to 2017 as growth at pursuit and favorable exchange rate variances were offset by expected negative show rotation at ges at ges we continue to strengthen our product and service offerings as we strive to become the preferred global full service provider for live events our award winning services are some of the most comprehensive in the industry and we continue to see more clients select us for an expanded array of services in addition to the increased scope of work our engagement with clients is moving up the value change as increasingly we are participating in strategy and planning discussions one of the major themes emerging in our space is the need to drive engaging an immersive experiences that events with an enhanced set of offering and our global reach our teams are delivering unique and seamless experiences for some of the world s leading show organizers and corporate brands one such example is our engagement with northwestern mutual following our successful work for its annual meeting last year the client expanded our relationship to include a multi event program consisting of event strategy audiovisual and production services in another instance we were appointed as a general service contractor for the 2019 occurrence of sibos a global financial services networking event through a competitive tender process our global reach in great track record producing sibos in north america enabled us to secure the 2019 event in london this september we also continue to gain traction and build market awareness with corporate brand marketers we re already working with some leading corporate brands like tableau mary kay dell and janus and for 2019 we ve already won three corporate clients inaudible a leading medical device company and genesis for inaudible we will be providing strategic consulting creative exhibit design and build and logistics movement management services for domestic exhibition program as well as its private client events and for the medical device company we will be providing similar services for a 12 show programs supporting its emergency health division in both cases we were chosen based on our global capabilities creative insight and innovative technology platform for genesis we will be delivering a multi city corporate event program aimed at training it s sales force on the highlights of its newly launched in g70 during this 13 city tour we will be providing audio and video production for the general sessions and breakout rooms as well as high end audiovisual equipment for the registration area corporate events represent a large and important market opportunity for us and we continue to focus on leveraging our existing capabilities and making smart investments to drive growth at an accelerated pace one of the key investments we made to facilitate growth in corporate events was the acquisition of audiovisual production service provider on services with av services representing about 50 of the total spend at a corporate event having this offering in house has strengthened our value proposition with current and prospective clients and while we are realizing the benefits of this acquisition as it relates to corporate event market share gains we still have some work to do to maximize the opportunities it presents more specifically we are getting better at capacity planning across the u s to ensure we re able to deploy the right equipment in the right place at the right time to minimize the cost of cross rentals we re accomplishing this through system integration and expansion of our asset base historically on services has held a strong footprint in the southeast last year we established a west coast presence by securing a contract to be the in house provider at the san diego convention center and in its next few months we will be opening a new facility in phoenix that will enable us to more efficiently service events in las vegas and other western cities additionally we re aligning our av sales team against the best live event opportunities for our company as a whole this means moving away from live entertainment projects which historically have accounted for a portion of on services revenue to enable an even greater focus on corporate events and conferences where we can more effectively leverage our full suite of services overall we ve made good progress against our growth strategy this year as we enter another year where we are facing negative show rotation we are sharply focused on driving productivity gains while we continue to selectively invest in key areas that will accelerate our growth in the corporate events and expand our relationship with existing clients now switching gears to pursuit pursuit delivered strong financial performance during 2018 while also undertaking numerous growth projects that will come online later this year for the full year organic revenue grew a solid 7 6 despite the impact of forest fires that hurt park visitation during our peak season our team did an excellent job of leveraging our recent refresh investments to drive growth and profitability through revenue management initiatives across our attractions and hospitality assets our key performance indicators improved year over year we realized an increase in samestore revenue per passenger of 7 7 at our attractions driven both by a higher effective ticket price as well as increased revenue from our food and beverage and retail offerings our hospitality assets also performed well with same store revpar growth of 2 9 which does not include our recently refreshed mount royal hotel that opened in july of 2018 i m pleased to report that guest feedback and reviews for the mount royal hotel have been extremely favorable and the property is already listed as the number two most popular hotel in the banff market according to tripadvisor in addition we have realized significantly higher revpar which was up nearly 30 compared to its prerenovation performance during the same period in 2016 pursuit strong performance this year is a testament to our refresh build buy strategy and revenue management initiatives which continue to add scale to the business while driving higher returns and continued support of our strategy we have many projects under way across pursuit s various collections that will accelerate our growth in 2019 and beyond in the alaska collection we are preparing to open 36 additional rooms this season at the seward windsong lodge which increases our bed base near our popular kenai fjords boat tour attraction in the glacier collection we are in the final stretches of constructing a new rv park cabin village in west glacier that will open in july this rv park is ideally situated at the west entrance of glacier national park and adjacent to our existing amenities in west glacier which include various dining and retail outlets in the banff jasper collection we have a number of refresh projects taking place primarily in the jasper market one is the reimagining of our 32 room glacier view inn at the columbia icefield which will be rebranded and renovated to provide a premium all inclusive hospitality experience our overnight guest will enjoy exclusive activities at our nearby glacier adventure and glacier skywalk attraction along with unique dining experiences and entertainment further north in jasper near our maligne lake boat tour attraction we are investing to upgrade our food and beverage offering at both maligne canyon and maligne lake the new maligne canyon wilderness kitchen will offer a new smoke house inspired menu with views of the scenic maligne river and at the maligne lake chalet we will be introducing a fantastic new indoor and outdoor dining space for guests to enjoy a special meal or cocktail with incredible view of picturesque mount maligne lake finally in flyover in the flyover collection we are under way with some great improvements to the exterior structure of flyover canada with the prime location at the end of canada place peer at downtown vancouver we re making improvements to provide a better sense of arrival for our guests along with the addition of new dining and retail space additionally our new flyover iceland attraction is on track to open this summer with the film footage captured and construction almost complete we are excited to unveil this fantastic new attraction the building looks stunning and it s already getting great feedback to the local community and press we look forward to replicating the success we had at the flyover canada in summary it was a strong year of progress against our strategy at pursuit and with multiple growth drivers in place we are looking forward to an even better year in 2019 and we continue to actively pursue additional organic growth projects and acquisitions to continue to scale pursuit s high margin collection of iconic experiences and now i ll turn it over to ellen to provide more color on our financials ellen ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer thank steve for the fourth quarter we posted a loss before other items of 0 09 per share on revenue of 296 9 million adjusted segment ebitda of 16 5 million and adjusted segment operating income of 4 1 million as steve mentioned earlier these results were better than prior year reflecting stronger financial results from both business units ges posted fourth quarter revenue of 281 8 million adjusted segment ebitda of 17 9 million and adjusted segment operating income of 8 9 million revenue growth came in stronger than we anticipated as compared to the 2017 fourth quarter revenue was up 18 8 million on an organic basis which excludes the impact of unfavorable exchange rate variances the revenue increase was 20 6 million or 7 8 the growth in revenue is primarily due to positive share rotation of about 8 million increased revenue for our corporate clients same store growth and new business wins ges s adjusted segment ebitda and adjusted segment operating income increased by 6 3 million and 6 6 million respectively from the 2017 fourth quarter these improvements primarily reflect higher revenue and lower performance based incentives pursuit posted fourth quarter revenue of 15 2 million adjusted segment ebitda of negative 1 4 million and adjusted segment operating loss of 4 7 million during a seasonally slow fourth quarter as compared to the 2017 fourth quarter revenue was up 870 000 the organic revenue increase which excludes unfavorable exchange rate variances was 1 4 million or 10 driven mainly by the reopening of the mount royal hotel as well as our revenue management and refresh efforts pursuit fourth quarter adjusted segment ebitda improved by 1 million on an organic basis and adjusted segment operating results increased by 825 000 also on an organic basis these results primarily reflects strong flow through on the revenue growth we realized during the quarter for the full year our income before other items was 2 34 per share on revenue of 1 3 billion adjusted segment ebitda was 146 3 million and adjusted segment operating income was 89 7 million as compared to 2017 our consolidated full year revenue decreased 10 8 million or 0 8 adjusted segment ebitda decreased by 7 9 million and adjusted segment operating income decreased by 9 6 million these declines were primarily driven by negative show rotation revenue at ges now moving on to the business group results ges posted full year revenue of 1 1 billion adjusted segment ebitda of 77 7 million and adjusted segment operating income of 39 8 million as compared to 2017 revenue declined 22 2 million or 29 9 million on an organic basis which excludes the impact of favorable exchange rate variances u s segment organic revenue decreased 24 9 million or 2 9 driven by negative show rotation revenue of about 27 million we also realized 22 8 growth in our u s based same show revenue which represented 33 8 of u s revenue during the year organic revenue for ges s international segment decreased 9 3 million or 3 3 primarily due to negative show rotation of approximately 8 million ges is adjusted segment ebitda and adjusted segment operating income decreased 10 5 million and 11 1 million respectively from 2017 these declines were primarily driven by lower revenue partially offset by a reduction in performance based incentives additionally ges s 2017 results included non recurring income of 2 8 million related to a contract settlement pursuit posted full year revenue of 185 3 million adjusted segment ebitda of 68 6 million and adjusted segment operating income of 49 9 million as compared to 2017 revenue increased 11 4 million the organic revenue increase which excludes unfavorable exchange rate variances was 13 3 million or 7 6 driven mainly by growth from our attraction and hospitality assets through a combination of our revenue management efforts and investments to enhance the guest experience our mount royal hotel which reopened in july after being closed due to fire damage in december 2016 contributed incremental revenue of about 4 million as steve mentioned earlier we are realizing much higher revpar at the mount royal hotel as compared to its pre renovation state with very positive guest reviews pursuit s adjusted segment ebitda increased by 4 2 million on an organic basis primarily due to higher revenue adjusted segment operating income increased by 3 1 million on an organic basis reflecting higher depreciation expense primarily related to reconstruction of the mount royal hotel now i ll cover some cash flow and balance sheet items before discussing 2019 guidance viad s full year consolidated cash flow from operations was 87 million versus 112 2 million in 2017 the decline was primarily due to changes in working capital capital expenditures totaled 85 5 million up from 56 6 in 2017 primarily due to investments at pursuit including the development of flyover iceland the construction of the west glacier rv park and the rebuilding of the mount royal hotel we repurchased approximately 340 00 shares during 18 including approximately 165 000 shares during the fourth quarter the aggregate full year purchase price was 17 2 million which is an average of 50 44 per share also our board of directors authorized repurchase of an additional 500 000 shares bringing our total authorization to about 600 000 shares well high return growth investments remain our first priority for capital allocation this additional share repurchase authorization will enable us to continue to opportunistically buyback our stock at attractive valuation at december 31st our cash and cash equivalents totaled 44 9 million our debt was 232 4 million and our debt to capital ratio was 34 now moving on to guidance for the first quarter we re expecting a loss per share of 0 75 to 0 85 as compared to a loss before other items of 0 49 in the 2018 quarter this change primarily reflects negative show rotation at ges as well as higher performance based incentive expense and additional resources to drive growth and profitability and high value areas within ges and pursuit for ges we expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of 260 million to 270 million as compared to 267 7 million in the 2018 quarter we expect a revenue headwind of about 8 million from the combination of show rotation and exchange rate variances to be at least partially offset by same show growth and new business wins we expect ges adjusted segment operating income to decrease by approximately 2 million to 4 million reflecting higher performance based incentive expense and additional resources to drive growth and profitability and high value areas for pursuit we expect revenue to be essentially flat to up about 2 million during a seasonally slow first quarter with the decline in adjusted segment operating results of about 2 million to 4 million the larger operating loss primarily reflects additional depreciation expense of about 2 million and additional costs to support continued growth of the business as well as the timing of certain expenses for the full year 2019 we expect consolidated revenue to increase at a mid single digit rate from 2018 with an increase in adjusted segment ebitda of approximately 6 million to 12 million depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase by 3 million to 5 million primarily as a result of the reopening of the mount royal hotel and other capital investments to support growth and efficiency gains adjusted segment operating income is expected to be in the range of 92 million to 98 million as compared to 89 7 million in 2018 our guidance assume exchange rates of 0 77 for the canadian dollar and 1 30 for the british pound based on this rates exchange rate variances versus 2018 are expected to have a negative impact of about 5 million on consolidated revenue a positive impact of about 500 000 on adjusted segment operating income and a positive impact on income per share of about 0 01 a 0 01 change in the canadian dollar would affect our full year revenue by about 2 5 million and a 0 01 change in the british pound would affect our full year revenue by about 1 5 million at ges full year revenue is expected to increase at a low single digit rate from 2018 with comparable ebitda we expect to continued same show growth and new business wins to offset an expected revenue headwind of about 30 million from the combination of share rotation and exchange rate variances at pursuit we expect full year revenue to grow by 15 to 17 from 2018 with an increase in adjusted segment ebitda of about 7 5 million to 10 5 million this guidance includes approximately 15 million to 17 million of new revenue from various investments we are making such as the development of the flyover iceland attraction and the west glacier rv park and the renovations of other assets that steve discussed earlier on a same store basis we expect pursuit revenue to grow at a mid single digit rate reflecting our ongoing revenue management efforts additionally i want to point out the start up costs related to the development of our flyover iceland attraction which is expected to open this summer are not included in these guidance ranges flyover iceland start up costs are expected to approximate 1 million during 2019 and will be excluded from our adjusted segment ebitda adjusted segment operating income and income before other items we expect our full year cash flow from operations to be in the range of 110 million to 120 million and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 75 million to 80 million which includes approximately 30 million of growth capex at pursuit and about 10 million of growth capex at ges additional 2019 guidance can be found in the earnings press release and one final item i wanted to touch on before i turn it back to steve is the status of our negotiations with the chicago teamsters we are currently working with union leadership to finalize the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement that includes the withdrawal from the central states pension plans this defined benefit pension plan has been designated under the pension protection act as being in critical and declining funding status we and the chicago teamsters union leadership believe it is in our collective best interest to withdraw from the central states plan and redirect future pension contributions to a new plan we are still working our way through the complexities of this transition assuming the withdrawal takes place it will trigger a withdrawal liability that is currently estimated at a net present value of approximately 14 million payable over the next 20 years and with that i ll turn it back to steve steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks ellen in closing we have some real bright spots in 2018 as well as some areas that didn t go as well as we wanted ges had some revenue visibility challenges with short term bookings that came up lower than expected in the third quarter but finished the year strong finish the year with a strong fourth quarter revenue growth pursuit was pacing for a very strong 2018 until heavy smoke from forest fires hampered visitation during the peak season nonetheless pursuit delivered 7 6 organic growth i m proud of our team for their great efforts during 2018 to overcome challenges and stayed focused on our key opportunities both business groups continue to make progress toward our strategic goals during 2018 and focused on expanding our offering to accelerate our future growth and profitability there are many positive changes we are driving in both business units and we re excited about our prospects for 2019 pursuit s growth will be amplified but the various investments we ve been making and continue to make to expand and enhance our collection of experiences at ges we continue to align our resources against key growth areas while also focusing on margin improvement actions additionally we have a solid pipeline of acquisitions and new growth opportunities that we are actively pursuing i want to thank the entire viad team for their dedication to driving long term shareholder values i m confident in our strategy and i m excited about the many opportunities that lie ahead for our company and with that let s open up the call for questions niki can you please open the call questions and answers operator thank you very much sir and absolutely now we will begin the question and answer session operator instruction our first question comes from the line of pablo o connor ph your line is open pablo o connor analyst hi how are you doing today steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges good how are you doing pablo pablo o connor analyst good i just wanted to have a couple of follow up questions about the pursuit business so earlier this year there was the government shutdown and the national parks were affected by that did you guys see any negative effect on pursuit s because of the government shutdown that happened and may happen in a few days steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yes faisel right now in the u s market we re near national parks those national parks are closed for the season and they won t be reopening until later this spring so we were not immediately impacted by the government shutdown that happened in january and we ll have to see what happens or how long if there is another government shutdown pablo o connor analyst okay and for the ges a few days ago i saw numbers that the number of attendance to show has been decreasing for the last few quarters and it may continue decreasing throughout the year so i was wondering what s what do you think of that s going to have a negative impact on the show rotation and shows in the upcoming years in 2019 and 2020 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges well i think the there are some fluctuation around the attendance numbers for some key shares that take place every year fortunately our revenue is more tied to the size of the event so what s most important to us is the net square footage of the events that take place that s more there is a stronger correlation to our revenue based on the next square footage so while we think the attendance number is important a more important number for our business is really the size of the event pablo o connor analyst okay and as i remember you guys were direct a few acquisitions to increase margins like to provide additional services to the shows are you planning on any additional acquisition this upcoming year continue to drive margin in the ges business steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yes faisel we continue to have an active pipeline of m a as well as organic growth opportunities for both businesses really on the ges side it is geared more toward higher margin services that really round out our comprehensive suite of services focused both on show organizer and corporate marketers so yes we will continue to look at opportunity that we have in our pipeline for both businesses pablo o connor analyst okay perfect thank you steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks pablo operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tyler batory your line is open tyler batory janney montgomery analyst thank you good afternoon everyone few questions from me first just wanted to touch on guidance and steve i appreciate the commentary on the cost side of things and ges in the fourth quarter but you talk a little bit more about your expectations on a cost side of things in that business for 2019 i mean you highlighted few of the issues and we re not going on in the fourth quarter i mean do you think you can make some improvements on those you kind of rolling forward some of that into next year steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges no tyler thanks for the question we can make improvements and we anticipate making improvements on some of those issues that we experienced in the fourth quarter some of them were one time issues around labor availability and some medical claims and things like that it s in our plans to do better than we did in the fourth quarter and so we think that we can overcome some of those challenges that we had tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay great and then on the pursuit side of things looking at 2019 if i can do the math at the midpoint looks like you guys are going to margin down year over year can you talk little bit about what you re seeing on the cost side there and obviously you have some new projects ramping up other incremental start up cost that are associated with some of those steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges there are so in 2019 obviously we re bringing on some new experiences whether that s flyover canada i m sorry flyover iceland or some of the renovation projects that we have so those are starting in the year we think that there are some start up costs associated with those that may impact full year numbers but again we see strong returns from the investments we re making on the pursuit side of the business ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer and i guess what just mentioned to that with the mount royal hotel it didn t open until july so the first half of the year we had business interruption proceeds so we had essentially operating income with no revenue that affected the margin a bit as well higher in 18 tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay got it that s helpful and then i wanted to ask about what you guys said about the same show growth i mean if you re looking at low single digits for 19 i think in the past you had talked about mid single digits can you talk a little bit about what s going on with the delta there and maybe generally what you re what you re seeing in the industry steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yeah we are guiding toward low single digits for 2019 on previous calls we ve talked about a couple of industries that have seen lower than expected growth specifically in retail and in the auto industry and we believe that those trends will continue going into 2019 but we see it captured within those few industries and not an overall market decline tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay got it and then maybe the last one from me you obviously the short term bookings seem to be an issue in the third quarter you talked about some strengths in the fourth quarter on that is that continued here into into 2019 i think in the past you talked about 2019 being a fresh start with respect to those is that still something that you re expecting steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yeah every year is a fresh start with some of our short term bookings because those are projects that are not contracted before you enter into the year so we had some visibility issues between q3 and q4 on short term bookings i m happy where we ended up on a full year basis but we need to get better at the visibility of what that revenue looks like in our forecasting tyler batory janney montgomery analyst okay great that s all from me thank you steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks tyler operator thank you our next question comes from the line of marco rodriguez your line is open marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst good afternoon guys thank you for taking my questions steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges hi marco marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst hey wanted to start on ges you re a little bit maybe if you can talk a little bit more on the on the corporate events and the av side of things you made mentioned that obviously your strategy is pushing more toward that type of revenue for margin expansion maybe if you can talk about more specifics as far as what sort of strategic initiatives or sales and marketing efforts you might have in place for our fiscal 19 to drive those areas steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges we talked a little bit about the new brands that we re bringing on in 2019 promote from a corporate branding perspective so we feel like we have some good growth in our sales initiatives and the way we are aligning our sales team to go after those opportunities from a margin perspective i highlighted during the call that we are opening up a audiovisual office on the west coast here in phoenix and that will really help us lower our cost of executing projects for our clients i think during the call i also mentioned in historically we ve been located primarily in the southeast and so our transportation costs and our equipment being out of inventory for longer periods when we do projects on the west coast was always hurting our margins this will allow us to improve that margin additionally marco i would add that in addition to having kind of our sales aligned and how during some activity to improve the margins of that business we re also adding resources in areas that we think will help grow our sales and that s around the creative support analytics and insights support that really will help us work hand in hand with our client our corporate clients in their strategy in the planning for their events marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst understood and that kind of brings up the next question you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that i guess recently or maybe this fiscal year you started to get involved in more planning and strategy discussions with your clients i would have assumed that there would have been some level of discussion prior to this but it kind of sounds like this is becoming a bigger thing and hence a better driver of revenue and our margin for you guys can you talk a little bit more about that and what sort of changing there steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges sure as part of our growth strategy that we ve had in place now for several years our goal is always been to move further upstream and get closer to our clients as they perform their strategy of how to activate their brands and how to bring their brands to life whether that s at a trade show or at a corporate event we ve made a number of acquisitions and other internal investments in order to position ourselves to really have those conversations what we re highlighting now is we re really seeing that really come to fruition where we are in with our clients discussing how to activate their brands where is the best return for their money with the audiences that they have so i m excited about the progress we ve made i don t want to make it sound like it s been a one year light switch this has been something that we ve been working at for a while and we felt like it was important to to talk about it today because we have seen an improvement in it marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it last quick question here on pursuit you had mentioned an incremental 15 million to 17 million in fiscal 19 from the refresh build buy type strategy obviously there are some new properties you have coming online here in fiscal 19 you also identified some refresh opportunities as well could you maybe kind of rank the projects from top to bottom there in terms of their impact on that 15 million to 17 million incremental revenue for 19 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges i think there are a number of projects in there as we ve talked about through the call they re all meaningful size projects i don t know if i have a specific ranking that would be able to share with you i think what s more important is that we re across all of them we re delivering a consistent guest experience that s elevated from where we ve been in the past and that s going to help us and that s going to help us in the overall markets that we serve i think one of our largest investments market would be really the flyover iceland experience so if i had to give you a number one i think iceland would probably be the the largest investment we made with return additionally i would add that put a lot of money into projects that are around the jasper area so again you look at the glacier view inn renovation which is now going to be the glacier view launch as well as the the maligne canyon projects those collectively are also a strong return for us and high high expectations marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it thanks a lot i appreciate your time steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve o hara your line is open stephen o hara sidoti company analyst yeah hi good afternoon steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges hi steve stephen o hara sidoti company analyst thanks for taking the question can you just talk about not sure if you mentioned this but in terms of the growth expected within pursuit how much of that is the new projects versus you know maybe improve visitation and then kind of if you had kind of the deficit last year would be forest fires what are you expecting this year in terms of i guess what s organic versus maybe the catch up from last year and the new projects steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges well i think we ve outlined that the new projects we believe will drive somewhere between 15 million and 17 million of revenue in 2019 so the other pieces there s combinations of whether it s not having the forest fires in 2019 and increased visitation or our revenue management we believe that it will be in the mid single digit organic growth so steve i guess to answer your question you have mid organic mid single digit organic growth and on top of that you have some of these refreshed projects or build projects like the flyover iceland adding somewhere between 15 and 17 million of revenue also ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer and just one further point i m going to add steve and kind of going back to the prior question that marco had flyover iceland is one of the premier projects the 19th impact on ebitda is not going to be it s mid year it s not going to be a high impact project but it is a big revenue driver and there s many other projects in there like the seward windsong lodge the rv park i mean there s a lot of projects that will contribute to the ebitda of 19 i just to wanted to clarify that steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks ellen stephen o hara sidoti company analyst okay thank you and then just it just is 2019 kind of the trough year it looks like i don t think any of the major shows happened in 2019 and i m just wondering what the last year that may be look like this was i think it s 2015 but maybe i m wrong there and i mean it looks like you ve had very in terms of versus 2015 i mean you have much better earnings performance it looks like expect to grow 2019 versus kind of the previous trough year and i know there has been acquisitions things like that but do you feel like you re i guess first is that trough idea correct and then if you can talk about maybe the what you ve done to kind of make it less kind of volatile in terms of the impact in these shows year to year steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges yes thanks steve so you re correct we the large non annual shows do not occur in 2019 as you remember they set up on either a two or three or in every four year cycle depending on the show which means they actually all will occur in 2020 but they did not occur in 2019 a similar year is 2015 when there is similar dynamics and our business has changed a lot from 2015 to 2019 there been a number of initiatives whether it s some of the acquisitions that we ve made over that time period whether it s some of the structural changes we ve made to how we service our clients to lower our cost basis so there s been a number of changes but the comparison is an accurate one between 15 and 19 stephen o hara sidoti company analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jamie yackow your line is open jamie yackow moab partners analyst hey guys good afternoon steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges hi jamie jamie yackow moab partners analyst just a couple from me can you guys i may have missed it but can you give us a little more detail on the growth capex for each of the segments for 2019 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges sure we describe it ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer i don t just one second jamie if you have another question you can go to that and i can come back to you jamie yackow moab partners analyst sure yeah i guess i m just wondering can you give us an update on the share repurchase activity in 2019 steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges so we have a new authorization that i talked about and we will be the same kind of strategy that we have inaudible growth but we will opportunistically do share repurchases and now we have the authority to do that we were running low as we start toward the end of last year so now we have about 600 000 jamie yackow moab partners analyst right have you guys been actively in the market or as have you not repurchased any share part of it ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer well we haven t repurchased what we repurchased in the fourth quarter was it because then the fy period started so we have not repurchased in 19 yet but we did repurchased in the fourth quarter 165 000 shares and then back to the growth capex i think we talked about lot of them but it s flyover iceland it s the maligne lake and canyon snb ph the rv park the seward windsong lodge expansion the glacier view lodge renovation as another one i think jamie yackow moab partners analyst wasn t that majority of that those dollars spent in 2018 now or other projects that ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer no that will be about 20 million in capital in 19 yes some of them happened started yes for sure but they continue into 19 jamie yackow moab partners analyst okay and on the ges side steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges on the ges side you have some investments around lowering our cost of fabrication so we re opening a fabrication facility in poland which will enable our emea team to provide exhibit building in fabrication at a significantly lower cost and what we re doing today we re also there some capital put toward the phoenix office for on services again to lower our fulfillment cost and lower cross rentals there s a major project around facility consolidation in las vegas where we will be combining two facilities into one of our existing facilities and there s a number of other projects that we re doing that will allow us to lower the cost of executing some of our shows by simplifying simplifying some of the organizer elements things like counters and entrance units jamie yackow moab partners analyst got it and then i guess just lastly the 1 same show growth seemed a little light relative to where you guys have been running was there anything unusual one show that maybe was a little weaker and if anything kind of point to steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges sure there is a single show it s an auto shows and it s kind of what we ve talked about it and our q3 remarks that we saw the softness around this one event if you pull that out you re in the roughly 3 same show growth range jamie yackow moab partners analyst got it all right great thanks thanks guys steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges thanks jamie ellen m ingersoll chief financial officer thank you operator thank you at this time we don t have any questions on queue operator instructions there are no incoming questions speakers you may continue steve w moster president chief executive officer and president of ges all right thanks niki thanks for your questions and your

determined in accordance with gaap we have provided certain financial measures that are not in accordance with gaap ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations are non gaap financial measures we define ebitda from continuing operations a non gaap financial measure as net income or loss plus interest expense minus interest income plus income taxes discontinued operations and depreciation and amortization from continuing operations we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as ebitda from continuing operations plus any pension and other post employment benefit opeb plan expenses impairments rationalization related charges initial public offering expenses acquisition and proxy contest costs non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar related party tax receivable agreement expense stock based compensation and non cash fixed asset write offs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is the primary metric used by our management and our board of directors to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we monitor adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplement to our gaap measures and believe it is useful to present to investors because we believe that it facilitates evaluation of our period to period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature allowing comparison of our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods unaffected by differences in capital structure capital investment cycles and fixed asset base in addition we believe adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and similar measures are widely used by investors securities analysts ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities we also monitor and present to investors the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations because we believe it is a useful and widely used way to assess our leverage our use of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments including any capital expenditures to augment or replace our capital assets adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect expenses relating to our pension and opeb plans adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect impairment of long lived assets and goodwill adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect initial public offering expenses or acquisition and proxy contest costs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect related party tax receivable agreement expenses adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect rationalization related charges stock based compensation or the non cash write off of fixed assets and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure in evaluating ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the reconciliation presented below our presentations of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be construed as suggesting that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non recurring items when evaluating our performance you should consider ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations alongside other financial

ll turn the call over to balu balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer thanks joe and good afternoon as expected fourth quarter revenues declined as a result of the downturn currently being felt across the semiconductor industry reflecting the broad based nature of the slowdown all four revenue categories declined by double digit percentages in the fourth quarter compared to q3 as many of our peers have noted the downturn appears to be cyclical in nature though it has been amplified by trade tensions and weaker domestic demand in china these additional factors have hit especially hard in the appliance and smartphone markets which accounts for roughly half of our total sales our communications category which is dominated by smartphone chargers and skews ph heavily toward chinese oems declined nearly 20 for the full year the decline was driven not only by general weak handset demand but also by slower adoption of fast charges ahead of the upcoming transition to usb pd technology our consumer category which is dominated by appliances fell 6 for the year reflecting weaker consumer demand in china as well as the impact of tariffs and broader trade disputes which have driven up the cost of appliances for us consumers while making customers and distributors more cautious about holding inventory as a result despite solid growth in our industrial and computer categories our total revenues for the full year fell by 4 while disappointed in these results we feel good about our prospects for 2019 for a number of reasons first we were among the earliest companies to feel the effects of the downturn and thus experienced a greater impact to our 2018 performance than broader industry while we can t predict the exact pace or timing of the rebound we are confident that we will also be among the first companies to benefit from the recovery as has been the case in the past cycles and while we hesitate to make predictions based on a single month of data particularly in the month of january ahead of the lunar new year holiday we are encouraged by recent trends january was our strongest month of booking since may of last year and while sell in revenues are affected by elevated channel inventories we did see a substantial drawdown in distributor inventories in january with sell through exceeding sell in by a wide margin for the month the second factor that gives us confidence for the year ahead is that while the smartphone market has a headwind was a headwind in 2018 we expect it to be a growth driver in 2019 even if the end market demand remains relatively subdued after much delay the rollout of usb pd charging technology is now under way and we are entering the next phase of growth in rapid charging we got a taste of this in the second half of 2018 with the ramp of a new usb pd tablet charger which drove strong growth in our computer category we won several high volume fast charger designs in q4 and we expect an uptick in revenues in the june quarter with much more substantial growth to come in the second half of the year third we expect continued strength in our industrial category a bright spot for us in 2018 with the growth of about 7 our high power business which makes up more than a third of the industrial category grew double digits for the second straight year driven by strength in renewable energy electric locomotives and energy exploration we are seeing healthy demand for high power products in china with spending on infrastructure such as rail and power grid projects is likely being used to offset weaker consumer demand our industrial category is also benefiting from the transition to battery power in lawn equipment vacuum cleaners and personal transportation as well as the proliferation of home and building automation products that are continuously connected to the grid and therefore benefit from our ultra low standby power technology fourth we believe that secular trends that have driven our growth in appliance market over the past several years remain intact we expect improvement in our consumer category in 2019 even after down year in 2018 our appliance revenues have grown at double digit cagr over the past eight years this growth has been driven by a variety of factors including market share gains higher dollar content and growing middle class in emerging markets where products like conditioning and dishwashers are now widely affordable than ever before we expect all of these trends to continue for years to come we see even greater opportunity in the appliance market following the november launch of our bridgeswitch motor drive products which add about add about 0 5 billion to our addressable market bridgeswitch is a highly integrated motor drive ic addressing brushless dc motors up to about 300 watts such applications include air conditioning ceiling fans and a wide range of appliance applications including refrigerator compressors water pumps dishwashers and washing machines and fans and blowers used in clothes dryers air purifiers and range hoods bridgeswitch ics offer substantial improvements in efficiency compared to existing solutions eliminating the need for heat sinks and giving designers flexibility to add features such as iot connectivity while remaining in compliance with energy efficiency regulations because our ac to dc products are already used by virtually every major appliance manufacturer in the world we are entering this market from a position of strength and we expect our reputation for quality and innovation to be a major asset for us we have design activity under way at several tier 1 appliance oems and we expect revenue from bridgeswitch products to begin ramping in 2020 in conclusion while the trajectory of the macro recovery is difficult to predict and trade remains a wild card we do expect the march quarter to be the trough of the current downturn for power integrations and we are particularly excited about the opportunity for accelerated growth in the second half of the year more importantly we are confident in our ability to outgrow the industry over time and our confidence is reflected in the fact that we are we have invested heavily in our own shares over the past year we use more than 100 million for repurchases during the year buying back roughly 5 of our shares and had 51 million remaining of our authorization at the quarter end with that i will turn it over to sandeep for the review of the financials sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer thanks balu and good afternoon as usual i will focus my remarks primarily on our non gaap numbers which are reconciled to the gaap figures in the tables accompanying our press release the one item of note in our gaap results is the tax benefit from new irs regulations clarifying the transition tax in the 2017 tax law we recalculated tax following the regulations and reversed a portion of the charge that we accrued in 2017 this resulted in a negative gaap rate tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 we have excluded this benefit from our non gaap results as shown in the reconciliation tables our revenues for the fourth quarter were 93 3 million down 14 from the fourth quarter of 2017 communications revenues were down 30 year over year in q4 reflecting weakness in smartphones while consumer revenues fell 20 driven mainly by weak demand and associated inventory adjustments in the appliance market industrial revenues grew low single digits year over year in q4 led by high power applications as well as chargers for battery operated tools lawn equipment and e bikes revenues in the computer category increased about 10 year over year driven by usb pd tablet business that began ramping in the third quarter on a sequential basis revenues were down 15 with all four categories declining double digits reflecting the breadth of the current slowdown revenue mix for the quarter was 40 industrial 34 consumer 24 20 communication and 6 computer non gaap gross margin was flat compared to the third quarter of 52 7 beating our forecast due to favorable end market mix and lower than expected consumption of higher cost wafers from our inventory non gaap operating expenses were 34 4 million more than a 1 million below our guidance we have held expenses flat for three consecutive quarters and are managing spending carefully in light of the weaker demand environment though in the year ahead we will continue to invest in our product pipeline and increase growth opportunities such as usb pd as well as the motor drive and automotive markets the non gaap effective tax rate for the quarter was just under 1 bringing our full year rate to 5 6 a bit below the expected range due mainly to the effect of the downturn on the geographic distribution of our income including a 0 03 benefit from lower than expected tax rate fourth quarter non gaap earnings were 0 54 per diluted share weighted average share count was 29 7 million for the quarter down more than 300 000 shares from the prior quarter as we have done consistently over the years we have deployed our balance sheet to take advantage of pull backs in the market we utilized 29 million for share repurchases in the fourth quarter buying back 488 000 shares at an average price of about 59 per share over the course of the year we utilized 103 million for repurchases buying back roughly 5 of our outstanding shares including dividends we returned 122 million to stockholders in 2018 even after the substantial return of cash our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling 229 million at quarter end we generated 84 million in cash from operations during the year up slightly from the prior year in spite of significant increase in inventories which consumed about 24 million in cash we believe this demonstrates the cash generation capacity of our business which should be more fully reflected as our inventory levels begin to normalize later in the year based on the strength of our balance sheet and expectation of continued strong cash flow our board has increased our quarterly dividend to 0 17 per share as balu noted we also had 51 million remaining on our repurchase authorization at the beginning of the current quarter and we continue to employ our price sensitive approach to buying back stock at quarter end internal inventories stood at 163 days up 35 days from the prior quarter we expect to remain at a fairly elevated level of inventory for the next couple of quarter and then to reduce inventories in the second half as we ramp new usb pd charger design for the smartphone market i would reiterate that we re comfortable carrying a higher than normal level of inventory during a downturn knowing that most of our products are not customer or application specific and carry minimal of solace and risk we are maintaining a higher percentage of our inventory in die bank which further mitigates our risks and positions us well to respond in event of a sudden recovery in demand looking ahead we expect first quarter revenues to be in the range of 90 million plus or minus 3 million as noted earlier we expect non gaap gross margin to decline as higher cost wafers flow through our inventory specifically we are forecasting non gaap gross margin to be around 52 non gaap operating expenses for the march quarter should tick up modestly due to seasonal factors such as fica taxes and the comparative effects of the year end shutdown that took place in december specifically i expect non gaap opex to be in the range of 35 million to 35 5 million lastly i expect the non gaap tax rate for the quarter and the year to be approximately 7 and with that i ll turn it back over to joe joe shiffler director of investor relations thanks sandeep we ll open it up now for the q a session christina would you please give the instructions for the q a questions and answers operator certainly operator instructions your first question comes from ross seymore from deutsche bank your line is open ross seymore deutsche bank analyst hey guys thanks for letting me ask the question a couple ones here on the revenue side and linearity of demand balu you mentioned that i think january bookings were the strongest since last may any color about where they re coming from end markets is it finally refilling channel inventory any sort of qualitative or quantitative detail on that would be helpful balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer it is broad based and a significant part of it is also coming from appliance market where it looks like they have ran out of inventory and i also want to point out that the sell through revenue was much stronger than sell in in january which is good that means that the demand is improving ross seymore deutsche bank analyst and i guess as far as the second half goes relative to last quarter and the same earnings call you basically said the same thing about the second half and the competence et cetera has anything changed as you look into the back half not only in the usb pd business first and foremost but around any of the other company specific metrics and design wins that you planned at that time at least to have ramp in the second half balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer no it s actually playing out exactly as we planned we won the number of designs particularly in the usb pd and so we expect a strong second half and we also think q2 will have a growth the growth quarter but second half will be much stronger sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer the second quarter as balu is indicating is we are talking on a sequential basis from the first quarter ross seymore deutsche bank analyst got you then one last one if i could sneak it in on the margin front for you sandeep i think on the last quarterly call you talked about the gross margin might be a little weaker year over year given the confidence in the comes in the phone ramp is that still the case and then i think you also said opex to be up about 6 or 7 year over year does that change given the lower level at which you exited last year and then i ll go away thanks sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer yeah i guess your question is for the year i m presuming for 2019 right ross seymore deutsche bank analyst correct sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer yeah so i think the gross margin for the year as i had indicated earlier will be around 51 5 i expect it to be for the year roughly in that range and the expense growth as you indicated will be in the 5 to 6 range ross seymore deutsche bank analyst got it thank you sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer year over year balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer thanks ross operator your next question comes from cody acree from loop capital your line is open cody acree loop capital markets analyst thank you guys for taking my questions and congrats on the progress maybe just following up on ross question as you look into the us pd ramp can you just maybe give us any details on where you re seeing your design wins balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer we have actually one designs with multiple oems and we expect the production to start pre production start in q2 and that s why we think that we will have a sequential growth in q2 followed by a much stronger second half where the number of these will go into full production cody acree loop capital markets analyst and what i guess trying to define what this could be as a percentage of revenue what are why are you thinking this could become in 2019 2020 i guess balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer it s hard to be precise but i think directionally what i d like to give you an answer is from an end market mix i think the highest growth we would probably get is from the communication segment which is probably driven by the cellphone and i would say that all other three segments will also grow given take roughly around equally but i think the would be disproportionately higher in end market mix this year cody acree loop capital markets analyst okay great and then lastly just the turn you ve seen in order demand has that been you said it s been broad based but i know the appliances have been one of your more problematic segment so are you seeing it s more geographically based or are you seeing it broad based globally and across all your end markets balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer yeah i want to warn that is just one month of information and january is usually a strong bookings month anyway because of lunar new year before the holidays people tend to book a lot but assuming that is an indicator we feel pretty good that you know all other markets of course communications will do really well this year that we believe but even the other markets are likely to grow this year so but i guess the biggest positive is the drawdown of inventory at the distributors in january if you compare that to q4 q4 the sell in and sell through are roughly equal we were expecting sell through to be stronger in q4 but it wasn t whereas in january the sell through was much stronger than sell in and that to me is a very positive indication and if that is true we should do well in appliances which is not done well last year cody acree loop capital markets analyst great thank you guys balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from tore svanberg from stifel your line is open tore svanberg stifel analyst yes thank you and i apologize if i m making some very specific questions here but when do you expect to be back to year over year growth i assume that will happen sometime in the second half balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer yeah in fact the second half we should get back to double digit growth on a year over year basis tore svanberg stifel analyst excellent very good and with that sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer that s for the entire second half tore that s for the entire second half not necessarily any particular quarter tore svanberg stifel analyst got it got it understood and if we then look at your inventory days now standing at 167 with that type of growth you should probably be back down to 110 or so in the second half sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer i think we will be back in our model somewhere our model is always 110 plus or minus 15 and i think we should get into our model in the 120 range somewhere by the third quarter tore svanberg stifel analyst okay very good sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer the first half will be elevated q1 could be slightly above even q4 but i think it will get normalized by the third quarter tore svanberg stifel analyst very good and balu now that the usb pd market is finally taken off is it worth asking questions about what type of power levels are you seeing out there because i guess the higher the power levels are the faster the charging maybe the higher the confidence is for you so what type of power level should we start to see here into 2019 balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer for usb pd we are seeing power levels all the way from 18 watts up to 60 watts for cellphones but obviously the higher power ones like 40 watts and 60 watts tend to be relatively low volume because of the higher end most of the volume is on the lower end which is 18 watts 27 watts and 25 watts and so on tore svanberg stifel analyst very good and then just one last question on bridgeswitch which is your latest market you mentioned 2020 revenue contribution should we assume that this business will be very gradual as a lot of your other new markets or could revenue be a little bit more substantial balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer it will be gradual simply because the appliance market not only has longer design cycles but it also has a slow ramp usually they ll design into one or two models and then migrate it to other models so our expectation is in 2020 it should be in the few million dollars of kind of thing i mean single digit millions tore svanberg stifel analyst very good thank you very much balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from ed roesch from sidoti company your line is open ed roesch sidoti company analyst yeah hi congrats on managing through that environment pretty nicely there wanted to look at parts of the communications other than smartphones to begin with i know you historically had some router business in there but then also looking at base station deployment starting perhaps for 5g in the coming year are those end markets showing any signs of life for you at this time balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer well the router market is basically an external adapter market so it s on the low end of the scale and we have deep focus away from it over the last few years but the base station market for 5g could be an interesting market but as you know the deployment will be relatively small from what everything we know in 2019 we certainly are watching that market to see whether we could it could help us grow our communications revenue outside of cellphones ed roesch sidoti company analyst okay and then switching to usb pd the new sound is pretty good there it s very encouraging for incremental revenue coming from that but would you say balu that the kind of the consumer value seeking that we ve started to see in the smartphone market could potentially narrow the scope for the adoption of that what kind of cost does that add to the bundle that the consumer is getting balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer the cost added is very small compared to the phone itself phone is the biggest cost there is an incremental cost but the value you get out of it i think is something the customer s highly desire we have seen a lot of blogs where people really prefer fast charging because many times in the middle of the day they need to charge the phone and they don t have the time to wait for hours so we think that it is a value add that will attract people to buy next generation phones rather than just a increase in cost in fact i think it is very small compared to the costs of the cellphone ed roesch sidoti company analyst that makes sense and then the last thing i don t know sandeep if you mentioned that the capital spending outlook for 2019 sorry for that sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer that will be kind of similar to 18 million around 25 million ed roesch sidoti company analyst okay operator all right thanks very much sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer welcome balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer thanks ed operator operator instructions your next question comes from christopher rolland from susquehanna international group your line is open david haberle susquehanna international group analyst yeah it s david haberle on behalf of chris rolland thanks for taking my questions today just to start off balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome david haberle susquehanna international group analyst hello can you hear me balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer yeah i heard you i just said welcome david haberle susquehanna international group analyst sorry thank you the tensions between the united states and china seem to be dragging on your business more than some of your peers given your chinese exposure if a compromise were to be reached at some point in the next couple of months would you expect to bounce back to be fairly quickly in your business or were there need to be a period of time for business to pick backups balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer that s a very good question i think our gut feeling is it will have a positive impact not just on us in the overall business for semiconductors whether we ll have a differential impact i really don t know david haberle susquehanna international group analyst got it and then second one on the distributor inventory levels i believe they were at about eight weeks last quarter can you talk about what you re seeing in distribution inventory levels balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer well they are a little elevated to where the revenue is but we if january is an indicator we saw the sell through coming much higher than sell in so we believe over the next couple of quarters they will get back to the normal levels david haberle susquehanna international group analyst got it and then last one for me on the industrial business your seasonality is typically very strong in the first half of the year but given the weaker macro picture how should we think about linearity of industrial as we kind of move through the year is it going to be a different shape than it typically would be balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer well in industrial roughly about one third of it is high power business which is closely tied to lot of infrastructure type of investments such as renewable energy high voltage dc transmission and electric locomotives and so on and we are seeing a healthy growth we actually had double digit growth two years in a row 2017 and 2018 we don t know how much we re going to grow this year but we certainly expect to grow in high power and interestingly we are seeing more investment infrastructure from china possibly because they want to the screws up the economy and so that part i think will grow this year and the remaining part the other two thirds is very fragmented we ve talked about the couple of areas where we see very strong growth like the home and building automation and power tools but there are also other other areas that could grow nicely this year which is like meters and motor control and so on and so forth so overall we think the industrial market will grow this year we just don t know how much david haberle susquehanna international group analyst got it thank you very much balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from ross seymore from deutsche bank your line is open ross seymore deutsche bank analyst hi guys i know you have a typically a difficult time in a single quarter knowing which segments are going to move which direction but i think on the last quarterly call you kind of gave us some hints on what you thought for the fourth quarter by segment any similar hint you could provide for the first quarter especially important given the trajectory you have through the rest of the year to kind of get our starting point normalized sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer so i think you should see improvement on the consumer segment and that s why where we talked about favorability and typically the industrial is slightly down and the reason for that is that the power business in the first quarter is typically a little lower that s when the funding comes through so i think the mix is going to get slightly favorable and that s what offsets the impact that we have of the higher wafer cost and that s why i think the gross margin guide i gave of about 52 for the first quarter ross seymore deutsche bank analyst and the comp side of things i know it was down substantially last quarter does it seasonally i know it goes down sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer typically in the first quarter comps is a little lower than normal but i think you ll start seeing comp start picking up as balu indicated with the usb pd design win in the second quarter ross seymore deutsche bank analyst got it that was it from me thanks guys sandeep nayyar vice president of finance and chief financial officer welcome balu balakrishnan president and chief executive officer thanks ross

introduce your host for todayâ s conference chief executive officer sachin shah you may begin sachin shah thank you operator good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2018 conference call before we begin iâ d like to remind you that a copy of our news release investor supplement and letter to unitholders can be found on our web site i also want to remind you that we may make forward looking statements on this call these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and our future results may differ materially for more information youâ re encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar edgar and on our web site 2018 was another strong year for the business as we continue to execute on our operating funding and growth initiatives we invested considerable time during the year enhancing our operational and investment capabilities around the world we also raised significant amounts of capital to ensure we are well positioned to invest on a value basis during this next cycle since our inception in 1999 we have delivered 15 per unit compounded annual returns to unitholders and we remain focused on delivering long term stable returns as we build the business of note in 2018 our ffo increased 14 on a per unit basis over the prior year as all of our businesses performed in line with expectations key operating priorities included cost reduction initiatives in north america and colombia which should improve our margins by approximately 20 million annually in the future we continue to build out our operating teams in the u s europe india and china over the year and continue to support our longer term plans in these markets from a growth perspective we commissioned approximately 60 megawatts of new wind and hydro development advanced over 350 megawatts of development in our pipeline and maintained our opportunistic approach to development which minimizes funding obligations and ongoing costs we invested 550 million into growth during the year including acquisitions and share buybacks accordingly we repurchased approximately 2 million bep units primarily in the fourth quarter at 27 per share our balance sheet and funding capabilities are strong we executed on our asset recycling strategy selling a partial interest in mature assets and exiting non core markets we extended all near term debt maturities during the year increasing the average duration of our debt to 10 years we now have no material debt maturities until 2023 we also maintained our investment grade balance sheet increased available liquidity which should exceed 2 2 billion once previously disclosed assets sales are closed and finally we continued to improve our distribution payout ratio which ended the year at 95 of ffo on an actual basis and 90 of ffo on an annualized basis with that iâ ll now turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating and financial results wyatt hartley thank you sachin and good morning everyone in 2018 we generated ffo of 676 million a 16 increase over the prior year during the year our focus was on integrating recently acquired assets and enhancing our operational depth at terraform power post the acquisition and sponsorship by brookfield the company was able to stabilize operations reinstate preventative maintenance programs engage with suppliers and establish new teams and processes this should lead to improved asset availability more predictable capital expenditures and enhanced operating margins over time in addition in terraform power we completed a significant acquisition of recently built wind and solar assets in spain which almost doubled the cash flows of the company on an annualized basis and facilitated the overall improvement of the companyâ s capital structure this assisted us to eliminate negative financing covenants and improve terraform powerâ s balance sheet rating the acquisition should provide stable long term cash flows to terraform power at accretive low teen returns and based on recent announcements of improving tariffs in spain could exceed our expectations we have one of the largest hydroelectric businesses in the world which we have doubled in size and expanded across multiple geographies over the last five years these assets contributed 671 million to ffo in 2018 hydroelectric assets benefit from long useful lives often over 100 years low operating and ongoing capital costs and the ability to match power supply with demand given their embedded battery like characteristics operationally we continue to lengthen the term of our power purchase agreements in colombia and brazil where power price volatility provides opportunities to enhance and stabilize future revenues our contracts in both markets are generally at or below market and therefore we see term extension as a unique opportunity to lock in upside in north america power prices remain low and therefore we continue to sign shorter term contracts at our hydro facilities to ensure we retain upside optionality if prices spike we have several large legacy ppas rolling off over the next three years for assets that deliver power to new england fortunately these contracts on a net basis deliver power at prices in the range of the current market therefore on renewal we expect overall revenue to be impacted by plus or minus 5 million beyond these contracts we do not have any material ppa maturities in north america until 2029 our wind assets delivered 160 million of ffo in 2018 over the last 18 months we more than tripled the installed capacity of our wind fleet through large scale and tuck in acquisitions and development projects coming online given that we now have a portfolio of wind assets across 10 countries and four continents this geographic diversification provides a significant mitigating benefit to resource variability and is a good example of why we prioritize diversification as a key value driver of our business our solar storage and other operations contributed 104 million of ffo in 2018 as we benefitted from large scale acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 today we have nearly 1 800 megawatts of pv concentrated thermal and distributed generation solar as well as 2 700 megawatts of both pumped and battery storage our solar facilities are underpinned by highly contracted cash flows with an average remaining ppa term of 17 years our storage facilities continue to provide critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and back up storage capacity products that are becoming increasingly valuable given the intermittency of wind and solar with regards to our balance sheet and liquidity we currently have no material debt maturities over the next four years and our overall debt duration is 10 years we have limited exposure to rising rates with only 7 of our debt in north america and europe exposed to interest rates we are well protected from foreign exchange volatility as we hedge all our developed market currencies we also hedge currencies when we are in the process of an asset sale as we did for example with our select canadian hydroelectric assets and our south african portfolio locking in very attractive returns on these disposals accordingly an overall 10 move in the currencies of markets we operate in both developed or emerging would have an overall 4 impact to our ffo post completion of recently announced asset sales we will have 2 2 billion of available liquidity over the course of the year we announced or completed key capital raising initiatives across the portfolio these initiatives included the sale of a 25 interest in a portfolio of select canadian hydroelectric assets as well as the announced sale of an additional 25 interest a small wind development project in the u k as well as sales of our non core assets in south africa thailand and malaysia which were agreed in 2018 and which we expect to close in the first half of 2019 looking forward we have a robust pipeline of assets that we believe would attract low cost of capital buyers in a sales process therefore we expect the majority of our growth to be funded by the proceeds from asset sales cash flows retained in the business and issuances of preferred equity or corporate debt as such while we may issue equity when it makes financial sense given the above noted funding sources we are not reliant on accessing this market to fund our growth in light of our recent growth strong balance sheet and access to capital we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a 5 increase to our quarterly distribution bringing our annual distribution to 2 06 per unit on a final note and on behalf of our employees and directors we would like to express our sincerest appreciation to our unitholders and many business partners for your contribution to our success thank you for your continued support and we look forward to updating you on our progress in 2019 that concludes our formal remarks thank you for joining us this morning weâ d be pleased to take your questions at this time operator question and answer session operator thank you our first question comes from sean steuart with td securities please proceed sean steuart thanks good morning everyone a couple of questions it seems like youâ re still predisposed to asset sales given the valuations youâ re seeing in the market can you give us an idea of the scale of that opportunity set in terms of how much youâ d be willing to part with and i assume itâ s fractional stakes of assets you still own but an idea of i guess the scale youâ re looking at potentially over the next little while sachin shah hi sean itâ s sachin here look weâ re not programmatically selling assets i hope thatâ s not what anyone thinks we will see assets when we feel we have a robust growth pipeline and today our m a pipeline is very strong around the world and therefore making sure that we have a strong level of liquidity is just prudent in that regard so i think itâ s going to be opportunistic itâ s not programmatic type of response to generating liquidity and as long as there is a significant supply of low cost capital around the world whether that be from institutions private investors asset managers or other power companies then we think the bid will remain strong and donâ t see that changing any time in the near future so iâ d say right now with a line of insight to over 2 billion of liquidity weâ re in great shape and that should allow us to fund our growth over the next few years very comfortably without stressing our balance sheet or without needing to tap public equity markets beyond that it will be again based on the strength of our m a pipeline sean steuart okay thanks for that next question is on colombia we saw some good margin gains there can you give us an idea of i guess cost youâ re still able to take out of that portfolio going forward what are your objectives there sachin shah yes when we acquired isagen we had a seven year program that we had undertaken to reduce cost improve capitalization manage the tax profile of the company start to build out the development pipeline and increase term of contracts and weâ re three years into that so iâ d say we still have very very good line of sight for the next four or five years and naturally when you get into a business you find things that you didnâ t realize would be there when you underwrote the transaction and so iâ d say itâ s been a really positive surprise coming into that organization and working with the management team and i think we have at least five more years of very strong improvement from a margin perspective and more importantly opportunities to grow the portfolio through development sean steuart okay iâ ll get back in the queue thanks sachin operator thank you and our next question comes from andrew kuske with credit suisse please proceed andrew kuske thank you good morning the first question relates to the buyback that you did in the quarter the 2 million units would you have done more or were you actually liquidity constrained at certain points in the market sachin shah hi andrew itâ s sachin so we definitely would have done more i think given our available liquidity right now we had set a price target in our mind of where we wanted to buy shares back considering other investment opportunities and our target returns so for us buying back stock it has to make sense for us from a return perspective relative to other opportunities we see and in and around that 27 we had a line of sight mid to high teens type returns from what we believe the intrinsic value of the business to be and therefore if the stock persists at that level we see it as very very good value and are happy to continue to put dollars to work reducing the share count of the business andrew kuske okay i appreciate that and then maybe just a follow up when you think about the public private market divide that exists clearly that presents an opportunity from selling certain assets you clearly have bought back your own units you can develop things how do you look at the equation on balancing all of those interests and then also to throw into the mix just the complexity thatâ s associated with say selling partial interest in certain assets sachin shah yes look i think â iâ ll start with your last comment which is the complexity of selling assets i think today given the stage we are in the business where almost everything we acquire is through our private funds weâ ve become very adept at being regular sellers of assets recognizing that our funds have 12 to 14 years of life attached to them and therefore if we can create the value that we envision when we acquired an asset and we can generate that very strong return then taking some money off the table and redeploying into an attractive opportunity is really a good use of capital and from a shareholderâ s perspective you can sell to a single digit cost of capital a 5 to 7 type return buyer and redeploy in that mid teens type of return range there is very very meaningful accretion that drops to the bottom line and in fact i would say you can see it in our business we had a pretty difficult payout ratio three or four years ago and we steadily chipped away at that and brought it down below 100 and we continue to do that and all of that is largely because most of our growth in the last five years has actually come through asset recycling and through redeploying that capital into stronger m a opportunities we did do a few equity issuances but not nearly of the quantum of the capital we deployed so i think you can actually go back and look at our track record over the last five years and see the value of that accretion and if we continue to use that strategy i think the accretion will be even stronger going forward in terms of balancing out between m a development and share buybacks weâ ve never been a large developer of assets and for us development we think about as really â it has to have better returns given it has higher risk than m a and i think what weâ ve seen in the developed markets around the world today is that the returns that investors are chasing are solo that many of them have also gone aggressively into development and bid those returns down to very low levels and the differentiation of risk is not being factored into those returns so today development in the western world north america and europe still continues to attract a single digit type return but youâ re taking all of that development risk and youâ re creating a funding obligation so what i would tell our investors is you shouldnâ t expect us to have a large development program in that part of the world and unless we start to see a risk reward profile change and more importantly we donâ t have the obligation to have to fund development pipeline and development burn rate like some of our competitors do which is a huge advantage when you want to protect your capital in your balance sheet and then lastly on share buybacks itâ s completely opportunistic for us we have a normal course issuer bid program under which we can buy back stock and if we see markets become highly volatile like we did in december weâ re going to be aggressive in buying back the stock andrew kuske thatâ s very helpful one quick one if i can did you have any benefit from polar vortex in the month of january in the north american portfolio sachin shah yes a little bit we saw prices spike for a few days here and there iâ d say what â the bigger impact was really on the forward curve where we saw sort of 90 day forward period really spike for us few days and then completely off as warmer weather came in andrew iâ d say â and i make this comment about both pricing and generation as weâ ve diversified the business in the last five years and become much more global in nature the impact of either significant movement in prices or hydrology has really become much smaller relative to the overall portfolio so itâ s nice when it happens but it doesnâ t move the dollar in the business so i wouldnâ t want anybody to think that thatâ s somehow a key driver of results in the first quarter andrew kuske okay great thank you sachin shah thanks operator thank you our next question comes from rupert merer with national bank please proceed rupert merer good morning everyone on growth you mentioned you have a robust pipeline over the next few years how quickly should we expect you to deploy that 2 2 billion in liquidity and if you can talk about where you see the growth opportunities and how important is diversification for you and i imagine diversifying out of hydro and out of north america sachin shah iâ ll start with the pipeline rupert today we see significant amount of opportunities in india just given that thereâ s been a bit of a dry up of capital in that market recently especially around renewal power assets weâ ve been patient in that market not really building out over the last five to seven years given how strong the bid has been and iâ d say all of a sudden within the last sort of six to eight months the market has really turned in our favor so thatâ s an area where we see continued interest and appetite for growth southern europe is also a very strong market for us and we see further opportunities like we saw with the saeta transaction midway through 2018 thereâ s pockets in the u s largely around development and repowering where we start to see the first signs of cracks as many of our competitors in the u s face significant headwinds in their business and have limited iâ d say capital for growth so i think those three markets today tend to be the strongest for us latamâ s always strong but i would say nothingâ s really changed in colombia or brazil in the last year both of those markets remain pretty decent for buyers but still highly competitive so i would say you should expect us to look for growth or have growth opportunities with a line of sight in india and southern europe and pockets of the u s and in terms of whether or not we can secure those transactions again itâ s completely opportunistic it will depend on whether or not weâ re successful in the various processes weâ re in and we are building our liquidity war chest in anticipation of those opportunities but also future opportunities given just we can look anywhere around the world and that generally works to our favor rupert merer okay great thanks for the color and then just quickly you mentioned in your press release that youâ ve executed cost reduction initiatives around 20 million so far and youâ ve given us some color additional cost reduction but how much of that 20 million would we have seen in q4 or in 2018 versus what we can expect to see in your run rate next year or 2019 sachin shah youâ ve probably seen â iâ d say in q4 we probably started to benefit from most of it but in the first three quarters it was sort of dribbling in a smaller way so iâ d say q4 was really where you started to see the full impact of that rupert merer great iâ ll leave it there thank you sachin shah thanks operator our next question comes from nelson ng with rbc capital markets please proceed nelson ng great thanks so i was just looking at the development pipeline and i noticed that thereâ s 35 megawatts of solar regarding glp in china could you just roughly indicate how many sites that is and also i guess bigger picture are there a lot more of those rooftop solar projects coming online sachin shah hi nelson i believe itâ s around 15 to 17 sites making up of that these are small installations and what i would say more broadly is look weâ re going to be very modest with our capital deployment in china we look at it as a very very long dated important market for us but we recognize the challenges around trade actions and around geopolitical risk and so weâ re building slowly in the country the level of capital is going to be modest i think if you look at our supplemental we talk about 1 million of additional ffo coming into the business as a result of that so i wouldnâ t want to place undue emphasis or overemphasize the impact of that i think itâ s just going to be a slow and steady program of building a bit of a footprint but we shouldnâ t expect â investors shouldnâ t expect significant capital deployment in that market for the foreseeable future nelson ng okay because i think when you guys initially announced the jv i think you had a target of about 300 megawatts over the first few years so i guess kind of using â doing the math if 39 megawatts gives i guess 1 million of ffo then weâ re looking at less than 10 million of ffo sachin shah yes and weâ re still on track to that remember this is a 50 50 jv with another company and then the 50 that we have is through our private fund so weâ re 25 of that 50 so itâ s pretty modest and again china is one of the most important countries in the world one of the largest economies in the world weâ re building out for the future but weâ re not â none of what we built today should lead to significant capital deployment or significant change in the risk profile of the business and you can just do the math and figure out that even if we built out the full 300 itâ s less than 10 million of ffo nelson ng okay got it and then just switching over to m a opportunities you mentioned that there are a number of opportunities but you also say that there are i guess very low kind of implied returns for operating and development assets so is it just mainly in i guess india and i guess spain and pockets of the u s where you see i guess those returns diverge from other markets and is that why youâ re focusing on those areas kind of near term sachin shah yes is the simple answer right now look i think â i give this example nelson it was only three or four years ago where you would have asked this exact same question about wind and solar in the u s and we would have said yes itâ s expensive the marketâ s expensive and then the terraform transaction showed up and i think what we would say to people is weâ re opportunistic investors weâ re going to move our capital where thereâ s scarcity and that scarcity is not something that you can predict to a high degree of reliability but today based on where we see those pockets of distress and where we know that we are in advanced stages with counterparties those three markets tend to be the most robust but again if we see an opportunity open up in another part of the world then weâ re going to be aggressive in pursuing it and we have the liquidity the balance sheet and the operating expertise to be able to capitalize on that nelson ng okay got it just one last question in terms of the sale of the second 25 interest in some of the canadian hydro assets has an agreement been signed and finalized or are you still in the stages of negotiating with potential purchasers sachin shah we canâ t comment itâ s an active process right now so we just wonâ t comment on where we are but other than saying weâ re advanced nelson ng okay got all right iâ ll get back in the queue sachin shah thanks nelson operator thank you our next question comes from mark jarvi with cibc please proceed mark jarvi good morning sachin shah good morning mark mark jarvi just wanted to touch base on and you talked about extending contracts and re upping in brazil and colombia iâ m just wondering what your views are on in terms of the emp project pretty substantial in the colombian market howâ s that going to inform your views about maybe taking sort of shorter term views on exposure or would you rather just keep locking in for longer duration sachin shah yes look i think in colombia the reason that we are prioritizing longer term contracts is because it opens up the financing markets for that business and thereâ s a huge huge benefit to both increasing the level of financing in the business but also the duration of the financing from a returns perspective from a return on our capital invested in that business so i would say you should expect us to continue to prioritize longer term contracts more than half of the contracts weâ ve signed since we acquired that business have been between 5 and 10 years and weâ ve actually started to sign some contracts in excess of 10 years and weâ ve increased the debt to ebitda in the business from 2 5x when we bought it up to about 3 25 now and that business can comfortably manage close to 4x debt to ebitda and if you could do that because you have more certainty on the revenue profile and length to your contract terms then that will really drive the returns that we underwrote and is a good strategy for the business to imply mark jarvi okay and then just going back to the commentary about where your contracts roll off and likely have â and then going down into new england given where capacity prices have been clearing the last couple auctions coming down does that capture still in that plus minus 5 revenue band sachin shah yes it is because the contracts we have for and for some of our other domestic new england assets it was all in price that included capacity so in fact what we were factoring in was around 3 50 to 4 00 a kw month which is kind of where the markets are clearing we never really underwrite our plan in excess of that mark and i think from a long term perspective thatâ s generally where weâ ve seen the markets gravitate to mark jarvi okay thatâ s helpful thanks operator thank you our next question comes from rob hope with scotiabank please proceed robert hope hello everyone just want to circle back on the comments regarding opportunities in the u s in certain pockets if we go back to the q3 call it seemed that youâ re looking more at corporate acquisitions just given commentary regarding your volatility in the equity markets just want to get a sense of are you looking at asset packages development opportunities or even corporate acquisitions there sachin shah iâ d say itâ s the latter two so weâ re seeing in the u s some distress in the developer community and weâ re also seeing some iâ d say pockets of smaller corporates not necessarily public but platforms that do operate in the u s â solely operate in the u s both struggling for access to capital and looking for an operational partner and iâ d say for that we think we are really well positioned to execute on a few of those opportunities but obviously itâ s going to be dependent how these markets play out and what alternatives those groups have robert hope all right thank you thatâ s it for me operator thank you our next question comes from ben pham with bmo capital markets please proceed ben pham okay thanks good morning i want to go back to your commentary on india i believe you said youâ ve been pretty bullish on the supply demand on there for some time and it sounded like a few years back when you mentioned it was more just trying to get a better understanding of that market so as you sit here today sachin just hearing your comments it seems like a lot of the due diligence and comfort levels to reach a level where you can actually look at deploying capital and itâ s just really the opportunities at this point sachin shah iâ d say it a little bit differently we found ourselves comfortable with india probably â look we spent the last six years looking at every renewable power opportunity in india thatâ s come across our desks and come across our group in india and i would say it wasnâ t that we were uncomfortable from a diligence or understanding perspective we got ourselves comfortable pretty quickly within the first 12 to 18 months on just the overall dynamic however valuations were just very very high for what we felt the risk profile was and so that valuation dynamic really just had not abated until very very recently so i think as youâ ve seen from us weâ re patient capital and it doesnâ t matter if itâ s going to take us six years to get into a country or get into a sector we will take our time but when we do we will feel like we acquired for value and we can build the business then at the right returns for our shareholders so i would say india was one of the markets around the world that was quite expensive for the last six years and all of a sudden weâ re just saying that started to change and we think there could be some unique opportunities to transact for value in that marketplace ben pham okay thanks for clarifying that and then on your slides on assets under construction you mentioned thereâ s another 200 megs that are construction ready could you do detail that a bit more of what that is and iâ m also curious thereâ s â your ffo from that 28 million is substantially higher than some implied change in the megawatts from the construction projects wyatt hartley ben thanks for the questions itâ s wyatt here so on the construction ready assets this is a mix of projects so this is some development of wind we have in the uk region and this is really just an expansion on some of the wind projects weâ ve been â continuing on the development of the projects we have in that region thereâ s also some hydro opportunities in brazil and then potentially a few more megawatts with respect to the opportunity we have with glp in china so itâ s a variety of projects and really weâ re just trying to progress to the end of securing a ppa or getting the development license as we need to do that and maybe i missed the second part of the question so can you repeat that ben pham yes sure so youâ re 150 megs right now youâ re building â youâ ve guiding for 15 million in ffo and then the 200 megs doubling of ffo so iâ m assuming the construction ready projects are just high return wyatt hartley itâ s a bit of a mix in terms of one whether itâ s through a fund and obviously weâ ll take a lesser percent when itâ s through the fund or when it comes to the chinese development if thatâ s through a jv partnership so itâ s a bit of what is our underlying ownership and then as you mentioned it is also incrementally the expected cash flow from the project based on the underlying economics sachin shah yes maybe just to be clear two of the projects in that portfolio of ready to construct are directly owned by bep so when theyâ re directly owned we just generate a higher ffo versus the balance which are on through funds ben pham okay i got it okay thanks for that and maybe lastly this is really just thinking two years from now your contract profile you have a good contracts roll off it sounds like the financial impact is not going to really be that significant but iâ m just wondering how do you guys think about your spot exposure because it looks like itâ s going to go up dramatically is that just really a concern when spot prices dramatically or you have a targeted contracted percentage that you guys want to get to eventually sachin shah yes look i think we definitely donâ t have a target i think you should be worried about it if you have high spot prices and you havenâ t locked it in and all of a sudden you have a cliff of cash flows coming if the markets turn weâ ve been iâ d say both lucky and good about investing in merchant hydro when power prices were low so a lot of the merchant hydro we bought in the last seven years we havenâ t put contracts on it but we bought it in this market thatâ s been dreadfully low as shale gas prices are down at 2 range and so weâ re very comfortable holding those as merchant assets could we lock in one two or three year contracts we could but we definitely will not lock in long term contracts in this environment and then iâ d say where we were lucky was that the contracts that are coming to the end of their term in the next few years just happened to be at the current market price so sometimes you got to be a little bit lucky and then other times you got to be good and fortunately for us we donâ t have any meaningful downside risk until 2029 which is the next real major ppa maturities that come due and iâ d say as weâ ve done in the last number of years we continue to grow the business continue to diversify and it continues to mitigate the impact of any one facility or any one ppa coming offline so we have a really good runway ahead of us we donâ t have any major cliff in our cash flows for the next 10 years and between now and then we continue to build the business and deploy capital and diversify around any single market exposure ben pham okay thatâ s very helpful thanks everybody operator thank you at this time iâ m showing no questions in the queue iâ d like to turn the call back over to sachin shah for closing remarks sachin shah again as wyatt said in the prepared remarks we thank everybody for their continued support in the business our employees our board our shareholders and all of our stakeholders we look forward to updating you on q1 and we thank you for all your support thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in todayâ s conference this concludes the program you may now disconnect everyone have a great day

crane president chief executive officer director thank you dan and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our year end 2018 call before i begin i d like to take a moment to thank our employees and those of other utilities who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent polar vortex our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100 during the week the investment reliability made on our system made a difference and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers in temperatures that reached a negative 23 degrees without including the wind chill factor i ll start on slide five 2018 was a great year for exelon and its operating companies we executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers communities and shareholders we are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019 our financial performance was strong full year gaap earnings were 2 07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were 3 12 per share well ahead of the original guidance range joe will walk through the details later in the call last year we shared our goals for 2018 and i m proud to report we re able to meet those commitments utility and generation operations saw ph improvements in multiple categories i ll get to those details in a few minutes last year exelon utilities invested more than 5 5 billion in capital primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience as well as improve reliability and resiliency which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores we are also effective on the regulatory front completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018 phi was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases including pepco and in maryland pepco in maryland and dc for the first time since 1980s we share the benefit of the tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than 675 million on an annual basis working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continue to improve customer service on the policy front the second and seventh circuit court upheld the zec program in new york and illinois although the plaintiffs have appealed to the supreme court we expect these rulings to stand new jersey enacted the zec legislation which will start this spring and we re still focused on preserving nuclear plants in pennsylvania the public utility commission of texas adopted the changes to the ordc curve earlier this year we are awaiting a decision from ferc on pjm s fast start proposal and on pjm s capacity market reform and pjm is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months these policies each in their own way better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet for the value it provides by addressing flaws in the existing energy and capacity markets we are growing our dividend by 5 each year through 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to 1 45 per share on monday we are dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve is an important part of who we are and what we do as part of our partnership with the un heforshe initiative we held an inaugural stem initiative leadership academies ph for teenagers in chicago and washington dc 95 girls participated in a week long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about stems we are expanding this program in 2019 and 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism and contributions our employees volunteered more than 240 000 hours last year on average seven hours per employee and donated nearly 13 million in addition exelon donated more than 51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint we are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34 000 employees we were named a best company for diversity by forbes black enterprise magazine diversityinc and the human rights campaign we are also recognized for environmental stewardship we received a score of a minus on both the cdp climate change and water surveys the highest by any utility for each we were named to the dow jones sustainability index for the 13th year in a row and we had a series of commitments for the 2018 we delivered on the task is for 2019 is beginning as big and i will cover those at the end of the call on slide six we show the impact that exelon management model has had on our utility operations each of our utilities have materially improved their operations since the merger with constellation or phi to put this chart in perspective comed has improved its overall reliability 60 since 2012 the hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off in 2018 all four of our utilities ended up in top quartile for saifi or outage frequency performance with comed at top decile and phi matching its best performance on record each utility achieved top quartile on caidi or outage duration except peco which missed top quartile by only one minute bge and comed performed in top decile bge and peco had top decile performance in gas odor response for the sixth consecutive year and phi delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row this level of reliability just demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers but we still have more to do to confront climate change and our customer demands customer satisfaction was top quartile at least three of the four utilities comed bge and phi had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction comed and phi scored in top decile for service level and bge and phi had their best performance on record our utilities in the mid atlantic operated extremely well in the face of record breaking rainfall dc saw more than 5 5 feet of rain baltimore 6 feet and philadelphia 8 feet of rain during last year our safety metrics improved over the year as a result of the actions we re taking to correct course we will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area turning to our competitive business on slide seven our generation fleet performed very well in 2018 providing an abundance of clean electricity that our country needs in fact exelon generated 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the united states more than twice as many as any other generator our best in class nuclear fleet operated very well last year our capacity factor was 94 6 exceeding 94 for the third year in a row in five out of the last six years we generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2018 our average outage duration was 21 days a new exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average exelon power s gas and hydro dispatch match 98 1 and wind and solar capture 96 1 were better than plan in october we acquired the everett lng import facility and in december we received a cost of service order from ferc on mystic units 8 and 9 which together will allow us to provide fuel security in new england market through may of 2024 our mystic units were critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in january and february of last year at constellation our c i operating metrics remain strong 78 customer renewal rates average customer duration of more than six years and power contract terms of 24 months on average we continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continued focus on cost is helping us support operating margins constellation s strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers that relationship is more than just power and gas but is built on constellation s unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals now i ll turn it over to joe joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer thank you chris and good morning everyone today i will cover our 2018 results annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance starting with slide number eight we had another strong year for the fourth quarter we earned 0 16 per share on a gaap basis and 0 58 per share on a non gaap basis for the full year we earned 3 12 per share on a non gaap basis which is at the midpoint of our revised full year guidance of 3 05 to 3 20 per share and 0 07 above our original midpoint exelon utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues with the early resolution of rate cases at pepco and favorable weather this was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms exgen performed in line with guidance realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018 including higher allocated transmission costs overall we delivered well in our financial commitments turning to slide nine it shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes across our utilities we received final orders in eight distribution cases we reached settlements in six of the cases at peco delmarva delaware on the electric and gas sides delmarva maryland and pepco maryland in dc which is the first time we ve had settlements at pepco since the 1980s additionally comed received 100 of its ask for the second year in a row and finally in early january the maryland psc approved 78 of the ask in bge s gas distribution case our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions on slide 10 we compare the 2018 trailing 12 month blended transmission and distribution earned roes to 2017 our constructive rate case results and the roll off of the fas 109 charge drove the improved earns earned returns this year we are encouraged by phi s ongoing improvement with earned roes improving by 70 basis points to 140 basis points exelon utilities earned a combined 9 7 roe up year over year we remain focused on achieving our utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned roes at phi and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities we expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9 to 10 range in 2019 on slide 11 we roll forward our outlook for utility capex and rate base growth covering 2019 to 2022 since the merger with phi in 2016 we have invested more than 16 billion in our utilities and plan to invest nearly 23 billion over the next four years as chris said these investments are improving our system reliability service experienced by our utility customers and preparing us for the future as a reminder the capex budgets we share with you reflect identified and approved projects as we move through time we generally find more investment due to additional system needs when we compare our 2019 to 2021 capex outlook versus the same period last year we plan to invest an additional 1 5 billion of capex for the benefit of our customers this additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility comed since the phi merger we have added nearly 6 billion in rate base across the utilities over the next four years we will grow our rate base 7 8 annually to 50 7 billion adding 13 1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of comed without paying a premium issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7 4 growth we projected last year as a reminder the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers these support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital where we do not have these mechanisms we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools in the appendix we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on slide 22 as you turn to slide 12 we continue to forecast strong utility less holding company eps growth of 6 to 8 even for the elevated even from the elevated 2018 starting point where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 0 09 per share compared to last year the outlook for 2019 to 2021 has improved with all bands increasing by 0 05 per share the durability of our industry leading earnings growth reflects a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and growing environmental goals along with concerted efforts to manage costs and are focused on modest customer bill in place ph on slide 13 we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company there is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure open gross margin increased 50 million due to improving spark spreads at ercot as well as higher prices at new york zone a and nihub which were offset by our hedges during the quarter we executed 50 million in power new business in 2020 open gross margin is up 150 million due to higher prices in most of our regions given our hedged positions and execution of 100 million of new business total gross margin increased by 50 million since last quarter we are showing you 2021 for the first time today which is down 250 million compared to 2020 the decline reflects lower power prices in pjm and ercot plus lower capacity revenues in new england and pjm our power and non power new business to go numbers for 2021 are consistent with prior years i should point out that these disclosures are based on 12 31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ordc curve changes in texas we ve remained behind our ratable hedging program in all years we ended the year 9 to 12 behind ratable in 2019 and 8 to 11 behind ratable in 2020 while we re 0 02 to 0 05 2 to 5 behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross commodity hedges our open market length is primarily concentrated in the midwest and texas we are comfortable maintaining a more open position given our balance sheet slide 14 shows our o m and capital outlook at generation our o m forecast has been updated since our third quarter call primarily to reflect the increased pension expense and the acquisition of the everett marine terminal that serves our mystic units like others the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns resulting in increased costs going forward in total these updates have added 75 million in o m costs or about a 6 0 06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021 however we even with these cost pressures we expect to see a 1 annual decline in o m over the next four years compared to our previous disclosure our 2019 to 2021 capex is up modestly in 2019 due to timing delays for our medway plant and some retail customer site at solos ph in 2020 with modest increases in nuclear fuel costs related to the rising uranium prices where we have hedged with collars we continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of the fleet slide 15 rolls forward exchange available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022 we expect cumulative available cash flow to be 7 8 billion which is 200 million higher than our previous four year outlook we will use the available cash flow from exgen to primarily fund the increased utility investment pay down debt and cover a small portion of the dividends we will invest approximately 600 million in growth capital which is primarily customer cited solar projects at constellation and as i mentioned the completion of the west medway plant in new england this quarter as i mentioned earlier we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities as a result we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities from exgen by 700 million to a range of 4 billion to 4 4 billion we will use between 300 million and 500 million of exgen s free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities as the utilities continue to grow exgen s portion of the dividend decreases even as the dividend itself grows finally we ve planned to retire between 2 2 billion and 2 8 billion of debt with our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets we felt it made more sense to shift cash planned for debt reduction to instead support the higher value adding and needed investments at our utilities a big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund utility growth without needing to go to the equity market this remains a differentiated advantage to our peers moving on to slide 16 we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings we are comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for ffo to debt and well above the agency s downgrade threshold as you are aware exelon and its operating companies are on creditwatch positive at both s p and fitch looking at exgen we are well ahead of our debt to ebitda target of 3 times in 2019 we expect to be at 2 4 times debt to ebitda and 1 9 times debt to ebitda on a recourse basis we are actively following the pge bankruptcy process pge is the sole offtaker of our antelope valley solar ranch or avsr facility which was funded by exelon s doe loans and project financing that are non recourse to exelon we along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with pg e recently received a ferc order affirming the commission s role to approve any modifications to existing ppas which pg e has challenged in the bankruptcy court we will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of avsr and the role what assets like ours have in california s clean energy future from an earnings perspective avsr provides 0 03 per share to exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics given the non recourse financials finally i will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on slide 17 we are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of 3 to 3 30 per share growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our consumers last year s completed rate cases and improvements in phi s roes the decline in generation earnings is a combination of normalized illinois zec revenues as we recognized 0 11 of 2017 illinois zec revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices which are partially offset by increased zec revenues in new jersey and new york as well as fewer planned nuclear outages as you think about our 2019 earnings the most notable new updates include the 0 05 per share increase to our utility earnings bands the 0 02 to 0 03 of pension expense at exgen due to worse than expected plan performance in 2018 as well as a roughly 0 03 per share drag from the recent everett lng facility acquisition which represents a negative near term impact but is a positive value driver in future with the mystic cost of service contract beginning in 2022 these impacts are reflected in our o m and other expense data in the appendix we expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of 0 80 to 0 90 per share more detail on the year over year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on slide 61 i will now turn the call back to chris for his closing comments christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks joe turning to slide 18 i want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019 we will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our generation fleet safely and reliably we will meet or exceed our financial commitments including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment grade rating at the utilities we will prudently and effectively deploy 5 3 billion of capital to benefit our customers and we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9 to 10 earned roes across exelon utility families by year end building upon successes in delaware dc maryland and pennsylvania we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and our commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers at generation a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that fail to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits as you know we plan to retire tmi later this year and as a reminder all of the dresden and portions of the braidwood and byron plants did not clear last year s pjm auction we will continue to engage with stakeholders on stay policies while advocating broader market reforms at the federal level we will support pjm price formation changes like fast start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected ferc order on pjm capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation for zero emitting nuclear plants we ll continue to grow our dividend at 5 annually through 2020 and we ll be a partner and ally in the communities we serve being a good corporate citizen for our customers communities and employees is key to who we are finally turning to slide 19 i will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders we have updated some of the numbers but the proposal proposition remains the same we ll continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting a 7 8 growth rate base growth and a 6 to 8 earnings growth through 2022 rolling forward another year at above the group trajectory we ll continue to use free cash flow from exgen to fund incremental equity needs of the utilities pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend we will continue to optimize value of our genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero emitting generation fleet selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen to load match strategy at constellation we will sustain strong investment grade metrics and we ll grow the dividend annually at 5 through 2020 the strategy underpins this value proposition is effective and providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders we are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside though needed policy and market reforms are required we are very confident about the prospects for exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at exelon with that operator we can now open the call up to questions thank you questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question this morning comes from greg gordon from evercore isi please go ahead greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks good morning christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey greg greg gordon evercore isi analyst on the utility side of the business obviously a pretty meaningful increase in capital opportunities across the entire set of companies what s the expected bill impact of the increase in spending and as you look at the long term and how much more sort of customer experience enhancing types of capital programs are you contemplating that are also affordable as we think about the opportunity not just this year to execute on this new capital plan but to continue to evolve your plan anne r pramaggiore senior executive vice president chief executive officer of exelon utilities good morning greg it s anne pramaggiore i ll start with your first question we when put our capital plans together our inaudible we look at what the needs are in front of us we challenge ourselves on o m and if you can look at the o m trajectory it s about 0 3 increase over that four year period and we always look at affordability and we ve got eight bills on the distribution rate side and four of them excuse me three of them are roughly flat over that period that we ve showed you four of them are trending less than inflation and one of them will come in right at inflation and that s a combination of managing our o m and also our energy efficiency programs which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here so that s basically what we re looking at in terms of affordability the other question that we ask ourselves is are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates and we so we ve been looking hard at the low income side and a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low income programs along with it so that s what we re looking at in terms of affordability bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income in terms of looking forward we think about investment in really three buckets one is reliability and resiliency just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems the safety of our systems and as the economy changes and we ve got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system how do you ensure that reliable and resilient the second area is really adapting to renewables and distributed generation we ve got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we ll see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile so thinking about sensors on the system artificial intelligence distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to six to eight cycles that sort of thing and then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do to the system to in expectation of that kind of shift so those are the areas that we think about and look at we watch our stakeholders very closely we re starting to see legislation and policy come out of dc in december big piece of policy there pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction executive order in january and so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they re directing us greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks i ll ask one more and then go to the back of the queue joe i know that we re focused on the strong 18 performance in the 19 outlook but i think it s sort of deja vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout sort of the guidance pieces for exgen and once again we see as we have in prior years pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of play is for the earnings outlook for exgen based on the algebra you gave in the deck it s 0 20 headwind on total gross margin probably 0 05 to offset through to o m but still much like we ve seen in past updates that are sort of two years forward but it looks like today significant pressures on exgen margin what can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think we roll into real time over the next two years joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer greg i appreciate the question the first thing is we re not in the business of giving eps guidance beyond the prompt year but having said that i think as you ve seen through time our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period when you look at the gross margin in 21 versus 20 there s a the two big drivers very simply are as you mentioned one is the backward dated price curve and obviously for us the biggest impact is that nihub and west hub and jim could talk for a while about what we re doing we are aggressively managing our portfolio you see that we re behind our ratable plan actual spot prices last year obviously we re very very strong and then secondly kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as pjm and others and so i don t think the story has been fully written there and obviously we have a very large open position the second piece of it is it s driven really by capacity and some of it s on in new england where the prices were lower year over year and in pjm where we had lower volumes clear year over year but from my lens i think the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility and hedging is less hedging is an example of that and through time we ve continued to improve our earnings and we ll continue to work hard to do that in 21 christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay thank you guys christopher m crane president chief executive officer director just to add on i mean just to summarize that you ve got low minimal liquidity in those years those 21 out 20 and 21 and out you build the liquidity as you go through the prompt year into the next year and you see the curves come up and that s been the pattern until we get these market reforms in if it s moving the plants in illinois or some amount of plants in illinois to frr so we can get better capacity treatment that matches the states environmental needs or if you look at price formation that s working through you look at reserve curves being revised there s a lot of activity going so that s why we re keeping more of an open position we believe the market will strengthen thank you chris thanks operator our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research please go ahead steve fleishman wolfe research analyst hi good morning christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hi steve fleishman wolfe research analyst couple of market structure questions hi chris the and first of all in pennsylvania in terms of any chance to get a zec could you give us an update there and when would something have to happen for you to not have to close tmi christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so the activities that kathleen is leading with the other operating companies in pennsylvania are promising we have some strong support the it s going to have to move this spring we have to order a core by may and we ve let the stakeholders know that so if we can get this through in that period of time we will be able to save the unit short of that we ll be beyond a return at the end of may steve fleishman wolfe research analyst and is there any sense on what the value targeted value of the zec is going to be in pennsylvania kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy i ll take that one steve this is kathleen i think that is subject to discussions that are ongoing among the lawmakers now so we don t have an estimate for you on how the program will look how it will be priced those are all discussions that are progressing as chris said with some promising outlook steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay and then just and then just have to ask and probably hard to answer just any better sense of where ferc may come out on the capacity market reforms is there any hints of the changes at ferc and what happened with the new england auction and things like that where you might have a better idea kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy i ll take that one as well i don t think we have a better idea than we did on our last call of how they re going to come out clearly there has been some delay in the schedule and i think that s a function of the transition effort the unfortunate death of the chairman integrating a new commissioner commissioner inaudible announcing her plans for retirement so while they have been able to get out a number of important orders others have lagged and the capacity market order is among them so i think as we re doing as you re doing looking at the tea leaves and trying to make an estimate of where we think things will land but we really have no signal yet from then from them as to when we ll see their final decision in that docket steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay great thank you christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hi good morning can you hear me christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah hear you well good morning julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent congratulations again wanted to follow up a little bit more on the utility side can you walk through some of the more specific dynamics for the longer date the 2022 ph year i mean that s just a pretty impressive jump at the end there what exact dynamics and also what kind of earned roes are you embedding out there within the ranges i mean just perhaps once you get to 22 what are we going to be talking about with respect to the position of the utilities and also rate case schedule et cetera anne r pramaggiore senior executive vice president chief executive officer of exelon utilities hi julien it s anne pramaggiore let me start by giving you a sense of what the investment patterns look like and what s sort of i think driving the trending that you re seeing and then between joe and i will talk about the roes so we are there s a couple of things that are happening there one of the one of the things that we ve done in the last year so we ve gone through an accelerated our gas main replacement program so we ve moved them from 30 years to 20 years and so you re seeing an acceleration of the gas investment so that s one of the pieces that you re seeing trending there one of the things that we re doing at peco now is we re looking at some material condition upgrades but we re also doing a program to upgrade for 4 kv feeders to 12 kv feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system you just can t put that stuff on the kind of some of the some of the feeders we ve got in place right now so that s one of the areas we re looking at another program at peco is really enhancing the underground replacement program again our underground cable program again some material condition work i think you are pretty familiar with the most of the phi work we ve got dc plug that we re getting started and we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in december at bg e we ve got some new ev investment that s coming through after the order that just came out of that commission so some additional capital investment there at comed we re expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place we re doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments we ve got about a program for security on our substations and cybersecurity that s about 900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our it systems to get ready for again more flexible dynamic grids so those are i think some of the things that you re looking at that s driving that capital trend joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer and julian i would julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst and just to jump on quickly in there what s driving that uptick from 2021 to 2022 though like what are the dynamics there specifically that s a pretty big jump joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer so julien it s joe good morning specifically to your question the jump from 2021 to 2022 anne went through each of the utilities the investment that we re making into the rate base that compounding of that investment is one component of it the second thing is we have a rate case in peco in 21 that has benefits in 22 and then the third thing is there s additional spending under the formula rate at comed so those three things together get you to that outcome julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent and then turning back to the other side of the business real quickly can you talk a little bit about everett and the contribution on the exgen side as you see that their cost of service kick in in 22 and then also how do you think about that asset align to even if mystic were ultimately to be pulled out of the market how do you think about the lng asset itself contributing kind of more structurally then joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think first of all julien we acquired the marine terminal in q4 as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the acquisition is earnings negative from 2019 to 21 driven by the increased o m amounts with about half of the 75 million increase in o m or 0 03 a share being driven by everett the gross margin in from the facility is included in our open gross margin calculation in our hedge disclosure and isn t really material what i would say is obviously the mystic cost of service contract arrangement begins in 2022 and it effectively the whole thing is bundled and it becomes accretive at that time we committed we had a capacity commitment prior to the last auction and we were committed to honoring that commitment and one way to do that was to acquire the facility we were also very clear to your question about how would we treat it in the future we re very clear that with any type of asset that isn t economically viable we re going to work for solutions and we d just try to make that asset viable but i think you ve seen with our financial discipline that when we ve had to we ve taken the stance of making the necessary change julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent thank you very much all congrats again christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit suisse please go ahead michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hi michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey just to be clear on the roes at phi you re saying that for all of 2019 you ll be at the 9 to 10 range or are you going to be or is that like a run rate at the end of the year joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer that that will be by the end of the year we will be in that range of 9 to 10 and effectively that will be the trailing 12 month at that time michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you okay and then on the ordc i understand it s a dynamic issue and you re not going to provide a point number on it but is one of the things we ve tried to estimate it ourselves here around 25 million perhaps of improvements for exelon just wondering if that s in the right ballpark of if you can give some kind of kind of hint as to where what kind of impact you see you re thinking this might have on you james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon right and to be clear hi it s jim mchugh michael to be clear we re talking about ercot michael weinstein credit suisse analyst yes james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon okay ercot ordc it is hard to put a pin point number on it the way we re looking at it right now is even before the ordc change we ve been talking about the tighter reserve margins and you ve seen the cdr reports and we re in agreement with where they re coming in now that the the reserve margins for this upcoming summer look like there are somewhere between 7 and 8 so i think with the ordc changes you re just making the likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role and where the summer prices go we ve seen the forward market move up since the end of q3 about 15 for summer on peak over the last month or so it s been more up and down and maybe a little higher but more flattish so i think the market has been moving around its expectation of just how many scarcity hours there is going to be which to your point is the hard thing to predict it obviously depends on when whether you have coincidental high loads with generation outages or variable wind ph the one way to think about it perhaps is a single hour at 9 000 is 1 on the kelly ph atc price it s about 13 or 14 on the summer on peak price so i think what we re going to see the market do is really trade in a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer 15 at a time just by adding an hour or two so to put an estimate on right now is really to say how many hours we think there s going to be but i think the way we like to think about it is increase the likelihood and send the right price signal in times of tight market conditions christopher m crane president chief executive officer director and michael jim is keeping a relatively significant open position and capability to extract value as we see volatility occur both in the forwards for the summer in 19 as well as we ll position ourselves well during that summer period michael weinstein credit suisse analyst thank you very much for the help operator our next question comes from shar pourreza from guggenheim partners please go ahead shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst hey joe and chris christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey shar shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst so just real quick on the o m profile change post 22 should we kind of assume this is the new normal and then as we re sort of thinking about some of the incremental revenue items that s not within plan that could help mitigate or at least support some of this o m pressures especially as you are closer to 2021 can you provide some color there i mean i think you mentioned mystic is obviously one of it and lng is another one is there sort of anything else we should be thinking about from the revenue offset side joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah the one thing i would say and obviously we haven t given you a forecast of o m 22 and beyond but the one thing i would say and i made the comment in my prepared remarks the debt cost of service agreement at mystic kicks in the middle of 2022 and that would more than that would more than offset those cost of the o m that we show you in 21 so effectively we ve turned into an accretive outcome as i said in my prepared remarks christopher m crane president chief executive officer director and the pension as you know the market for 2018 was not great on equities december was pretty tough we bought we got some of that portion of that back in january so we ll watch the pension we ll watch the pension investments the interest rate and the return on the fund is what will drive the other half of what we saw the increase on this year so everett and the pension as far as our o m discipline we work through the out years we are far less than 1 all across the company and that s dealing with labor contracts at 2 5 wage increases and other inflation forces so we do have a good plan on continuing to drive efficiency hold cost down and maintain that inflation rate it s much lower at the generating company than utilities but still the utilities are less than 1 shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst okay got it and then just lastly chris that s helpful and then as we are sort of thinking about the exgen gross margin i know we ve talked about in the past maybe taking somewhat of a different approach when it comes to managing the portfolio i e maybe operating some of the units more from a portfolio approach right so like maybe fitzpatrick or nine mile right are we sort of seeing any impact from this in your outlook or is this sort of something you guys are still going through internally and then i guess what i m asking is also beyond fitzpatrick and nine mile is there any sort of things we should be thinking about from taking a more holistic approach to the assets james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon yeah hi it s jim i mean if you re talking about new york i think the way we re thinking about the portfolio in new york is the capacity the zec payment that we receive in new york has somewhat of an offsetting nature as energy prices rise so we re out in the outer years so we re looking to make sure we hedge our portfolio along the lines of where we think that index is going to set as the zec as the zec price sets according to the structure the index structure in the zec so really there is not much of a shift in our strategy i think what we ve been doing is finding opportunities in the nearby year or two on the energy side to understand if we think the market is slightly under priced or slightly overpriced and right now recently we ve seen a pretty strong move in new york prices and we ve been getting some good hedges off in inaudible area to take advantage of those higher new york energy prices shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst well i guess what i m asking is have you seen any synergies for having these two assets so close to each other more from less from a dispatch and hedging but more from taking these systems taking the units and operating them as one so like there s clearly there are some synergies in there for owning these two assets so close to each other right christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah i didn t get your question at first so i m sorry shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst yeah no that s ok christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so the nuclear team is evaluating that what they can do as far as management what they can do as far as warehousing we have looked at combining security plans that s a cost prohibitive item but they re continuing to drive through that there is definitely more synergies that we will be continuing to work on there as we complete the integration and the team has time to work through the regulatory process and the have time to make the investments to make these consolidations shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst perfect and those synergies are incremental to plan christopher m crane president chief executive officer director right they will be if the ones that aren t included now but there are also our initiatives that are under way across the nuclear fleet we re looking at how we centralize warehouses versus having over stock warehouses each site there s a lot of initiatives under way right now to take advantage as technology advances and built into the cost savings number now is an assumption that we centralize engineering since we have much more digital information and we can trend the equipment remotely versus having the engineers in the plant on the site so there s things like that across the fleet that we re working on shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst perfect chris that s what i was trying to get at thanks so much christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from jonathan arnold from deutsche bank please go ahead jonathan arnold from deutsche bank please go ahead christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey jon jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst just a couple of things on the o m at exgen just when you look behind the numbers that obviously you have these new incremental pieces are you still going after the 200 million in additional cost savings christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst it was inaudible services that you shared at eei christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah that s still in the plan we have line of sight on that we will continue and just to reemphasize we re not going off plan on savings or efficiency two factors pension underperformance in the market required us to higher state o m in everett which reverses out and provides greater revenues in the 2022 time frame so these are these are the things we have line of sight of it s not that the efficiency programs have been taking the pedal off of them jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst yes i just wanted to check chris because you re showing it slightly differently so thank you for that christopher m crane president chief executive officer director okay we ll get with you to clarify that jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst and secondly i see you ve removed the disclosures on new england sensitivities and we realize this the mystic contracts out in 2022 but just is that just smallness and to make it simpler or something else going on there joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer no there s really nothing else going on jon so we made a decision to collapse the new england region into open gross margin because with the changes to that facility and the inputs of gas and so on and the associated contract change the volume of our power generation output is falling and then you ve got the gas acquisition of everett that we ve talked about and that would all factor into that everett calculation and you would see changes that were quite variable quarter to quarter most importantly the overall gross margin is very small compared to the total gross margin we provide you in the disclosure jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay thank you and then could i don t know if this is timely or not but chris any update on sort of efforts to engage the legislature in illinois coalition building et cetera i know we did notice the bill that seem to be very renewables only got flouted this week so i was just curious if you have any comments you d like to share on that christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yes it s very very early in the legislative cycle as you can imagine we work within the coalitions within the state on what s needed to continue to advance the environmental stakeholders the customers and sound investments so we have our folks communicating in those coalitions and communicating with the legislative folks premature to say what it looks like at the end of the day but they re at the beginning of the sausage making right now and we ll continue to have productive conversations jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst is the ferc order sort of a prerequisite for actually something happening this year christopher m crane president chief executive officer director not on the not on the utility side and we are looking at other methods on the generation side the ferc order definitely would be helpful to get out in a timely manner but we don t need it you can go to use the current statute and achieve what we think we can do want to do jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay i ll leave at that thank you chris christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our final question comes from praful mehta from citigroup please go ahead praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much hi guys christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey praful how are you praful mehta citigroup analyst great thanks for this marathon session so quickly on pjm i guess one last piece that was left for fast start so just wanted to get any color or view on timing of when that will come we ve been waiting for it for a while at this point kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy yeah this is kathleen and i think that s within the scope of what i said earlier on the call unfortunately there are a number of matters that are lagging and that s one of them and i think the transitions at the commission have affected their ability to get big orders out but just going back to the beginning of the fast start docket recall this is something that the ferc ask pjm to file so we continue to feel confident about how it will turn out even if it s going to take a little bit longer than we expected praful mehta citigroup analyst got you fair enough and then slide 15 that s very helpful capital allocation slide that you provide in that if we think about all of these benefits that are potentially coming on the exgen side right with fast start ordc zecs all of them are incremental to the plan how would we think about the allocation given you ve kind of hit your utility investment targets you re hitting your debt reduction targets where does the incremental capital that potentially comes through go in your mind going forward joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer the answer in my mind i think is very similar to what you saw with the plan with the increase at the utilities anne talked about the way she s thinking about the three buckets of investment at our utilities and the benefits to our customers as it relates to those three buckets we would continue to look at ways as we see projects that are beneficial for that we would continue to look at investment there and then i think additionally that increment those incremental dollars continue to provide us operating and strategic flexibility and we ve talked about what that s worth in the sense of our hedging and the opportunity to be more aggressive with that and other things so we re going to continue to work hard to get those and i think it gives us a lot of opportunity praful mehta citigroup analyst got you but share buyback is not one of those that s in the plan right now or contemplated in the plan christopher m crane president chief executive officer director no it s not contemplated in the plan but all investments are bounced ph off a share buyback before they re made praful mehta citigroup analyst got you perfect well i appreciate it guys thank you so much christopher m crane president chief executive officer director well i want to thank everybody all of you for participating today i want to thank you our employees for another good year both operationally and financially so with that we ll close out the call and all have a good weekend operator this does conclude today s

the venezuela myth keeping us from transforming our economy modern monetary theory mmt is getting significant media attention these days after rep alexandria ocasio cortez said in an interview that it should be a larger part of our conversation when it comes to funding the green new deal according to mmt the government can spend what it needs without worrying about deficits mmt expert and bernie sanders adviser professor stephanie kelton says the government actually creates money when it spends the real limit on spending is not an artificially imposed debt ceiling but a lack of labor and materials to do the work leading to generalized price inflation only when that real ceiling is hit does the money need to be taxed back but even then it s not to fund government spending instead it s needed to shrink the money supply in an economy that has run out of resources to put the extra money to work predictably critics have been quick to rebut calling the trend to endorse mmt disturbing and a joke that s not funny in a feb 1 post on the daily reckoning brian maher darkly envisioned bernie sanders getting elected in 2020 and implementing quantitative easing for the people based on mmt theories to debunk the notion that governments can just print the money to solve their economic problems he raised the specter of venezuela where money is everywhere but bare essentials are out of reach for many the storefronts are empty unemployment is at 33 percent and inflation is predicted to hit 1 million percent by the end of the year blogger arnold kling also pointed to the venezuelan hyperinflation he described mmt as the doctrine that because the government prints money it can spend whatever it wants until it can t he said to me the hyperinflation in venezuela exemplifies what happens when a country reaches the it can t point the country is not at full employment but the government can t seem to spend its way out of difficulty somebody should ask these mmt rock stars about the venezuela example i m not an mmt rock star and won t try to expound on its subtleties i would submit that under existing regulations the government cannot actually create money when it spends but that it should be able to in fact mmters have acknowledged that problem but it s a subject for another article what i want to address here is the hyperinflation issue and why venezuelan hyperinflation and qe for the people are completely different animals what is different about venezuela venezuela s problems are not the result of the government issuing money and using it to hire people to build infrastructure provide essential services and expand economic development if it were unemployment would not be at 33 percent and climbing venezuela has a problem the u s does not and will never have it owes massive debts in a currency it cannot print itself namely u s dollars when oil its principal resource was booming venezuela was able to meet its repayment schedule but when the price of oil plummeted the government was reduced to printing venezuelan bolivars and selling them for u s dollars on international currency exchanges as speculators drove up the price of dollars more and more printing was required by the government massively deflating the national currency it was the same problem suffered by weimar germany and zimbabwe the two classic examples of hyperinflation typically raised to silence proponents of government expansion of the money supply before venezuela suffered the same fate professor michael hudson an actual economic rock star who supports mmt principles has studied the hyperinflation question extensively he confirms that those disasters were not due to governments issuing money to stimulate the economy rather he writes every hyperinflation in history has been caused by foreign debt service collapsing the exchange rate the problem almost always has resulted from wartime foreign currency strains not domestic spending venezuela and other countries that are carrying massive debts in currencies that are not their own are not sovereign governments that are sovereign can and have engaged in issuing their own currencies for infrastructure and development quite successfully i have discussed a number of contemporary and historical examples in my earlier articles including in japan china australia and canada although venezuela is not technically at war it is suffering from foreign currency strains triggered by aggressive attacks by a foreign power u s economic sanctions have been going on for years causing the country at least 20 billion in losses about 7 billion of its assets are now being held hostage by the u s which has waged an undeclared war against venezuela ever since george w bush s failed military coup against president hugo chávez in 2002 chávez boldly announced the bolivarian revolution a series of economic and social reforms that dramatically reduced poverty and illiteracy as well as improved health and living conditions for millions of venezuelans the reforms which included nationalizing key components of the nation s economy made chávez a hero to millions of people and the enemy of venezuela s oligarchs nicolás maduro was elected president following chávez s death in 2013 and vowed to continue the bolivarian revolution recently as saddam hussein and moammar gadhafi had done before him he defiantly announced that venezuela would not be trading oil in u s dollars following sanctions imposed by president trump the notorious elliott abrams has now been appointed as special envoy to venezuela considered a war criminal by many for covering up massacres committed by u s backed death squads in central america abrams was among the prominent neocons closely linked to bush s failed venezuelan coup in 2002 national security adviser john bolton is another key neocon architect advocating regime change in venezuela at press conference on jan 28 he held a yellow legal pad prominently displaying the words 5 000 troops to colombia a country that shares a border with venezuela clearly the neocon contingent feels it has unfinished business there bolton does not even pretend that it s all about restoring democracy he blatantly said on fox news it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela as president nixon said of u s tactics against salvador allende s government in chile the point of sanctions and military threats is to squeeze the country economically killing the public banking revolution in venezuela it may be about more than oil which recently hit record lows in the market the u s hardly needs to invade a country to replenish its supplies as with libya and iraq another motive may be to suppress the banking revolution initiated by venezuela s upstart leaders the banking crisis of 2009 10 exposed the corruption and systemic weakness of venezuelan banks some banks were engaged in questionable business practices others were seriously undercapitalized others still were apparently lending top executives large sums of money at least one financier could not prove where he got the money to buy the banks he owned rather than bailing out the culprits as was done in the u s in 2009 the government nationalized seven venezuelan banks accounting for around 12 percent of the nation s bank deposits in 2010 more were taken over chávez s government arrested at least 16 bankers and issued more than 40 corruption related arrest warrants for others who had fled the country by the end of march 2011 only 37 banks were left down from 59 at the end of november 2009 state owned institutions took a larger role holding 35 percent of assets as of march 2011 while foreign institutions held just 13 2 percent of assets over the howls of the media in 2010 chávez took the bold step of passing legislation defining the banking industry as one of public service the legislation specified that 5 percent of the banks net profits must go toward funding community council projects designed and implemented by communities for the benefit of communities the venezuelan government directed the allocation of bank credit to preferred sectors of the economy and it increasingly became involved in private financial institutions operations by law nearly half the lending portfolios of venezuelan banks had to be directed to particular mandated sectors of the economy including small business and agriculture in a 2012 article titled venezuela increases banks obligatory social contributions u s and europe do not rachael boothroyd said that the venezuelan government was requiring the banks to give back housing was declared a constitutional right and venezuelan banks were obliged to contribute 15 percent of their yearly earnings to securing it the government s great housing mission aimed to build 2 7 million free houses for low income families before 2019 the goal was to create a social banking system that contributed to the development of society rather than simply siphoning off its wealth boothroyd wrote venezuelans are in the fortunate position of having a national government which prioritizes their life quality wellbeing and development over the health of bankers and lobbyists pay checks if the 2009 financial crisis demonstrated anything it was that capitalism is quite simply incapable of regulating itself and that is precisely where progressive governments and progressive government legislation needs to step in that is also where in the u s the progressive wing of the democratic party is stepping in and why ocasio cortez s proposals evoke howls in the media of the sort seen in venezuela article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress the power to create the nation s money supply congress needs to exercise that power the key to restoring our economic sovereignty is to reclaim the power to issue money from a commercial banking system that acknowledges no public responsibility beyond maximizing profits for its shareholders bank created money is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states including federal deposit insurance access to the fed s lending window and government bailouts when things go wrong if we the people are backing the currency it should be issued by the people through their representative government today s government however does not adequately represent the people which is why we first need to take our government back thankfully that is exactly what ocasio cortez and

overview as north american traders return to their posts to put the finishing touches on the week s activity the dollar index is extending its advance for a seventh consecutive session if sustained it will be the longest advance since february 2017 the rally was sparked after the dovish fomc statement had sent the greenback lower and the employment data raised the possibility that the fed overreacted to the stock market volatility the s p 500 turned back from the 200 day moving average and gapped lower yesterday 2719 2724 setting the tone for the still holiday thinned asian markets where the msci asia pacific index fell for a third session to snap a four week rally european shares are faring better and dow jones stoxx 600 is poised to extend its streak for the sixth week benchmark 10 year bond yields are mostly a little lower oil is trading heavily and with wti for march delivery near 52 40 it is off more than 5 this week the largest decline since late december on the other hand the shock from vale is still behind iron ore s surge today s 5 rally bring it to a five year high asia pacific when the reserve bank of australia left rates on hold and did not appear to change its stance much the australian dollar traded firm but subsequent clarification has seen the aussie tumble governor lowe s neutral bias was quantified in today s monetary policy statement growth and inflation forecast were cut the australian economy is expected to grow 2 5 in the year through june down from 3 25 previously and growth in the following year was cut by half a percentage point to 2 75 the softer inflation forecast was attributed to oil with core inflation remaining near 2 the forecasts would suggest an easing bias rather than a neutral stance that lowe claims yet the rba still seems to be counting on the strength the job growth to boost wages and inflation the underlying issue is whether the weakness in property prices will crimp consumption and growth australia s 10 year bond yield fell 13 bp this week to 2 10 the record low was set in august 2016 near 1 80 japan s december current account surplus seasonally adjusted was broadly in line with expectations a key point to remember is that japan s current account surplus is not driven by the trade balance as much as the investment income balance consider the trade surplus on the balance of payments basis was about jpy216 bln while the seasonally adjusted current account surplus was roughly jpy1 56 trillion separately and arguably more importantly japan reported the first increase in overall household spending since august it eked out a 0 1 rise year over year in december on the other hand japan s leading economic indicator fell for a fourth month in december and at 97 9 it is at the lowest level since october 2016 the dollar s range for the week against the japanese yen was set on monday jpy109 45 jpy110 15 thus far today is the first day this week the dollar has not traded above jpy110 where a 640 mln option expires today the market does not appear to have given up on trying to establish a hand hold above jpy110 though it would seem to require stronger equities and or higher yields the australian dollar is off about 2 4 this week 0 7075 the next downside target is near 0 7020 the new zealand dollar also has sold off this week and its 2 2 decline 0 6750 is the largest since august europe the euro made a marginal new low for the week dipping below 1 1325 briefly the pessimism toward emu was not changed by today s data which on balance was a bit better than expected italy s was not december industrial output slumped 0 8 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a 0 4 rise however news from france was better french industrial production was expected to rise 0 6 instead it rose 0 8 and manufacturing output itself was up 1 0 this recoups most of the weakness since in november for its part germany reported a considerably smaller trade surplus 13 9 bln euro in december vs 20 4 bln euros in november but more importantly imports and exports recovered smartly after falling 0 3 in november exports rose 1 5 imports rose 1 2 after falling 1 3 in november uk prime minister may is still asking for some dilution in the plan for the irish backstop even though everyone has said not indeed the backstop is in case no agreement is reached there cannot be a time limit or it undermines the very purpose of the backstop it would encourage delay tactics until the time limit passed meanwhile a vote in parliament that was expected next week looks likely to be delayed although everyone says they want to avoid a no deal exit it can still be stumbled into and that continues to worry investors if the euro s losses are sustained it will be the first week since may 2018 that it has fallen in each session yet all that has happened is that the euro has gone from the upper end of its range 1 15 to the lower end of its range 1 13 indeed it should not be surprising for the euro to snap its losing streak and close higher ahead of the weekend large option expires today 1 1280 and 1 1380 do not seem particularly relevant but there is a 2 0 bln euro option struck at 1 1365 on monday that may be interesting sterling is trading higher for the second day in a row but it won t be enough to prevent the second consecutive weekly loss yesterday s losses nearly fulfilled a retracement objective 50 of the rally since the flash crash in early january that is found near 1 2830 its recovery suggests that perhaps some move was completed on the upside a move through yesterday s high near 1 30 would confirm a more constructive near term technical outlook america trade talk optimism was hit yesterday president trump apparently indicated that there will be no meeting with china s president xi before the early march deadline economic adviser kudlow s assessment that there were still sizeable differences gave the sense that the lack of substantial progress was the reason the two presidents won t meet rather than a schedule conflict at the same time the battle over chinese telecom companies continues and formal action in the us will be forthcoming meanwhile germany is balking and is opposed to banning huawei for example this will likely server to exacerbate tensions as the us europe trade talks move into focus the unctad found that europe is poised to benefit the

add to annual per share amounts due to material changes in the company s weighted average diluted share count if any per share amounts may not add to total per share amounts due to rounding historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time however since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for that reason the company considers ffo normalized ffo fad and normalized fad to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity reit in particular the company believes that normalized ffo is useful because it allows investors analysts and company management to compare the company s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non recurring items and other non operational events such as transactions and litigation in some cases the company provides information about identified non cash components of ffo and normalized ffo because it allows investors analysts and company management to assess the impact of those items on the company s financial results the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo nareit defines ffo as net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property including gains or losses on re measurement of equity method investments and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis the company defines normalized ffo as ffo excluding the following income and expense items which may be recurring in nature a merger related costs and expenses including amortization of intangibles transition and integration expenses and deal costs and expenses including expenses and recoveries relating to acquisition lawsuits b the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs expenses discounts make whole payments penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the company s debt c the non cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses the non cash impact of changes to the company s executive equity

subtracting merger related expenses deal costs and re audit costs and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities ffo normalized ffo fad and normalized fad presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions ffo normalized ffo fad and normalized fad should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders determined in accordance with gaap as indicators of the company s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as measures of the company s liquidity nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs the company has historically reconciled ffo normalized ffo fad and normalized fad to income from continuing operations because it provides insight into the company s continuing operations but in light of recent sec regulations that changed the presentation of statements of income the company now believes that net income attributable to common stockholders is the most comparable gaap measure the

look to the remainder of the year we continue to expect cae to deliver on its annual outlook said marc parent cae s president and chief executive officer operating income was lower year over year in the third quarter which is consistent with our expectation that a disproportionate share of our annual growth outlook will be driven by record simulator deliveries in the last quarter of the fiscal year order activity for our civil training solutions remains strong with our civil backlog reaching a new high 4 6 billion we signed long term training agreements with customers including easyjet and year to date we have sold 64 full flight simulators which already surpasses the annual industry record in defence performance for the quarter was mixed we had strong revenue growth driven mainly by a

operating income was 25 2 million 7 6 of revenue down 17 compared to the third quarter last year revenue growth was driven mainly by a higher level of services activity including contracts under recently acquired aoce and the u s navy chief of naval air training contract both of which are in the early stages of profitability ramp up additional timing related factors contributed to lower defence operating income and margins compared to the third quarter last year defence experienced higher r d expenses related to recent development programs and it had delays in the advancement of higher margin programs including the canadian fixed wing search and rescue and the uae naval training centre the company has already taken measures to mitigate these timing related impacts in the

growth in fiscal year 2019 in civil the company expects to continue generating low double digit percentage operating income growth as current momentum for its innovative training solutions translates into market share gains and new training customer partnerships as well civil expects to maintain its leadership position in ffs sales and to receive approximately 70 orders in fiscal 2019 in defence the company continues to expect mid to high single digit percentage operating income growth as it delivers from backlog and continues to win opportunities from a large pipeline cae expects healthcare to resume double digit growth this year with its broader market reach expanded offering and the continued launch of innovative products the company expects revenue and profit to be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year owing to the impact of the adoption of ifrs 15 as it relates to simulator product deliveries and a five week work disruption which preceded the successful negotiation of a new collective agreement with cae s manufacturing employees in canada the company has successfully accelerated production to mitigate the impact of this action and expects to deliver a record number of simulators in the last quarter of its fiscal year funding growth opportunities remains cae s top capital allocation priority and continues to be driven by and supportive of growing customer training outsourcings in its large core markets cae currently expects total annual capital expenditures to reach approximately 250 million in fiscal 2019 cae prioritizes market led capital investments that offer sustainable and profitable growth and accretive returns and support its strategy to be the recognized worldwide training partner of choice management s expectations are based on the prevailing positive market conditions and customer receptivity to cae s training solutions as well as material assumptions contained in this press release quarterly md a and in cae s fiscal year 2018 md a ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers effective april 1 2018 cae adopted ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers which changes the way the company recognizes revenue for certain of its customer contracts the main impact of ifrs 15 to cae is the timing of revenue recognized for certain training devices that were previously accounted for using the percentage of completion method that no longer meet the requirements for revenue recognition over time revenue for these training devices are instead recognized upon completion while this change impacts the timing of contract revenue and profit recognition there are no changes to cash flows from the contract the financial results reported in the press release for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 have been restated to

www sec gov the fiscal year 2018 md a is also available at www cae com the realization of our forward looking statements including our ability to meet our fiscal 2019 outlook essentially depends on our business performance which in turn is subject to many risks accordingly readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward looking statements we caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results non gaap and other financial measures this press release includes non gaap and other financial measures non gaap measures are useful supplemental information but may not have a standardized meaning according to gaap these measures should not be confused with or used as an alternative for performance measures calculated according to gaap they should also not be used to compare with similar measures from other companies management believes that providing certain non gaap measures provides users with a better understanding of our results and trends and provides additional information on our financial and operating performance 1 free cash flow is a non gaap measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations we use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity we calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities subtracting maintenance capital expenditures investment in other assets not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds net of payments from equity accounted investees 2 order intake and backlog order intake is a non gaap measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received for the civil aviation training solutions segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract additionally expected future revenues from customers under short term and long term training contracts are included when these customers commit to pay us training fees or when we reasonably expect the revenue to be generated for the defence and security segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract defence and security contracts are usually executed over a long term period but some of them must be renewed each year for this segment we only include a contract item in order intake when the customer has authorized the contract item and has received funding for it for the healthcare segment order intake is typically converted into revenue within one year therefore we assume that order intake is equal to revenue the book to sales ratio is the total orders divided by total revenue in a given period total backlog is a non gaap measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options obligated backlog represents the value of our order intake not yet executed and is calculated by adding the order intake of the current period to the balance of the obligated backlog at the end of the previous fiscal year subtracting the revenue recognized in the current period and adding or subtracting backlog adjustments if the amount of an order already recognized in a previous fiscal year is modified the backlog is revised through adjustments joint venture backlog is obligated backlog that represents the expected value of our share of orders that our joint ventures have received but have not yet executed joint venture backlog is determined on the same basis as obligated backlog described above unfunded backlog represents firm defence and security orders we have received but have not yet executed and for which funding authorization has not yet been obtained options are included in backlog when there is a high probability of being exercised but indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are excluded when an option is exercised it is considered order intake in that period and it is removed from unfunded backlog and options 3 operating profit is an additional gaap measure that shows us how we have performed before the effects of certain financing decisions tax structures and discontinued operations we track it because we believe it makes it easier to compare our performance with previous periods and with companies and industries that do not have the same capital structure or tax laws 4 segment operating income soi is a non gaap measure and is our key indicator of each segment s financial performance segment operating income gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment s performance we calculate total segment operating income by taking the operating profit and excluding the impact of restructuring integration and acquisition costs 5 utilization rate is one of the operating measures we use to assess the performance of our civil simulator training network while utilization rate does not directly correlate to revenue recognized we track it together with other measures because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance we calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period 6 simulator equivalent unit seu is an operating measure we use to show the total average number of ffss available to generate earnings during the period 7 maintenance capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity growth capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity 8 net debt is a non gaap measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents we use it as an indicator of our overall financial position and calculate it by taking our total long term debt including the current portion of long term debt and subtracting cash and cash equivalents 9 net debt to capital is calculated as net debt divided by the sum of total equity plus net debt 10 return on capital employed roce is a non gaap measure we use to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital we calculate this ratio over a rolling four quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the company excluding net finance expense after tax divided by the average capital employed for non gaap and other financial measures monitored by cae please refer to cae s md a filed with the canadian securities administrators available on our website www cae com

the relief rally in equities appears to have run out of steam as risk aversion gained momentum on concerns trade talks are not progressing fast enough and global growth fails to show signs of stabilization despite accommodative stances globally the us dollar and japanese yen could continue to see gains if the political risks yield no progress and the economic backdrop continues to diminish next week the focus will remain on trade talks brexit corporate earnings and if we will see another government shutdown if us negotiators do not deliver a more optimistic tone on the trade front early in the week we could see risk aversion accelerate the republicans and democrats do not want to see another shutdown and talks appear to have been constructive this week even if both parties agree on a deal uncertainty lies with the president since it is unknown if he would accept funding of just north of 2 billion for his border wall funding well shy of his heavily demanded 5 7 billion us

prepared remarks we will open the lines for questions 2018 was another year of strong top line growth in earnings acceleration for century leading to our 16th consecutive year of profitability for the year we increased revenues 51 to 2 1 billion grew our deliveries 68 to 6 099 homes increased our net new contracts 48 to 5 657 homes continued the expansion of our national footprint into additional attractive markets with the purchase of wade jurney homes increased adjusted ebitda to 228 million and increased adjusted net income to a record 120 million or 3 94 per share assuming we had owned 100 of wade jurney homes for all of 2018 we would have delivered 7 092 homes for the full year and homebuilding revenues would have been 2 3 billion despite a strong overall year for century our fourth quarter home deliveries and net new contracts were impacted by buyer hesitation to increased interest rates and tightening affordability which has resulted in an industry wide softening of homebuilding activity in the second half of 2018 however we remain confident in long term housing fundamentals given underlying job and population growth along with overall positive economic conditions despite the slower buyer activity we generated solid growth in our key operating metrics during the fourth quarter including home sales revenue up 24 and sg a percentage improvement of 80 basis points our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin performance of 20 4 was in line with our expectations and for the full year we achieved an adjusted homebuilding gross margin of 21 6 which improved by 20 basis points compared to 2017 this resulted in adjusted homebuilding gross profit dollars up 51 for the year we were especially pleased with this full year accomplishment in light of higher construction costs which continue to impact the industry we ended the fourth quarter up 65 in backlog to nearly 2 200 homes equating to 670 million in backlog value an increase of 17 compared to 573 million in the prior year quarter this significant increase in backlog homes and value puts us in a good position for 2019 we were pleased with the 2018 performance of our financial services group which provides mortgage title services and insurance to create a one stop solution for century s homebuyers this business tripled its revenue to 31 7 million and delivered over 6 times year over year growth in pre tax income to 8 8 million representing an attractive margin of approximately 28 we have actively been providing our financial service offerings to our existing century communities buyers and have now expanded these offerings to include the wade jurney homes buyers we expect our financial services group will continue to produce substantial growth at attractive margins and meaningful profits in its ongoing expansion we remain confident in the strength and stability of our business given that our national footprint is diverse and comprised of attractive markets with strong economic fundamentals we have a high concentration of homes at affordable price points which we began investing in several years ago we have a strong track record with experienced cycle tested corporate regional and divisional management teams along with our proven ability to source land control cost and strategically deploy capital into sound investments during 2019 we will continue to carefully monitor the homebuilding climate in each of our markets and pursue our disciplined growth strategy while taking advantage of our diversified national scale to achieve additional improvements in our business i d now like to turn the call over to rob to discuss our markets and business in greater detail robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director thank you dale and good afternoon everyone in 2018 we grew century into a top 10 homebuilder through strategic positioning and attractive markets with a higher mix of home deliveries at lower price points our acquisition of wade jurney homes was a significant catalyst to that end overall net new home contracts were up 48 year over year with organic growth accounting for 22 and we ended the quarter at 122 active century communities branded selling communities across our markets we are seeing employment gains which is a positive data point for local economic growth additionally the average month supply across all of our markets is approximately 2 5 months these economic indicators remain supportive of long term growth throughout our national footprint however homebuyer demand may vary well remain muted in the near term due to a variety of macro factors including an adjustment period where buyers are adapting to higher mortgage rates and tightening affordability in regard to the specifics of our regions and starting with our mountain region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased 23 and 16 respectively year over year in the fourth quarter new home prices have remained steady throughout the region despite adverse impacts of affordability denver s economy remains strong and the city has the second fastest growing millennial population in the nation high growth companies in affordably priced housing of drawn new employees to salt lake city las vegas is ranked fourth in the country with population growth and sixth in wage growth supporting a robust sales environment for many homes priced under 350 000 where we are also seeing strong traction this market strength led to a 30 increase in deliveries for our las vegas division our texas regions operations have improved substantially as we continue to strategically gear our products toward more affordable price points while improving margins fourth quarter new home contracts in this region improved 38 year over year while deliveries increased by 34 the demand for entry level product remains healthy throughout our texas region where we have transitioned lower price points which have improved overall velocity and margins our west region has been the most impacted by softening market conditions and tightening affordability specifically the san francisco bay area and southern california while inland areas has held have held up relatively well our west regions product offerings and communities target lower price points in their market and our planned opening of six communities in the first quarter of 2019 will improve our positioning to capture demand in this region in the southeast region home sales revenues and backlog dollar value for the fourth quarter increased by 9 and 25 year over year respectively the job growth outlook in charlotte is promising where several large corporations are currently planning to move their headquarters in atlanta and nashville demand fundamentals are steady despite weaker affordability trends that have impacted new home sales in certain areas tech workers continue to fill the city in atlanta with the city s tech village posting over 300 start ups which we view as a positive for longer term growth since completion of the wade jurney homes acquisition in june of 2018 we have invested capital and other resources into the asset light entry level business line to enable and support the significant growth that we expect these initiatives include the following the addition of experienced management personnel dedicated to this business source from both outside century as well as transfers of people from within century implementation of enhanced systems processes and procedures including the start of the back office conversion which we anticipate will be largely completed by the end of the second quarter expansion beyond the southeast and into alabama texas arizona indiana and ohio where we continue to expect these markets to generate closings in the first quarter of 2019 we have also made a change to the sales approach for wade jurney homes whereby we are now selling homes later in the construction cycle homes are no longer being marketed prior to the start of construction while this shift will impact near term sales volume we do not anticipate that it will materially impact the timing of closings in the spec based business model as evidenced by year end finished unsold homes being less than 3 of the region s total homes under construction for the 6 5 months of 2018 that we fully owned the business wade jurney homes delivered 1 377 homes for 210 million of revenue and generated 20 800 000 of pre tax profits excluding purchase price accounting considering our national portfolio and despite challenging market conditions that continued into the fourth quarter of the year we are pleased with the progress we made during 2018 including our increased entry level exposure and dedication to improving the efficiency of our operations nationwide strong local economies have assisted in mitigating softer market conditions such as healthy household formations strong jobs and strong population numbers we have increased our offering of incentives consistent with our expectations and we ll continue to do so as necessary in markets where it makes sense as of year end we had approximately 38 000 owned and controlled lots that position us well through 2020 into 2019 we will continue to focus on streamlining and creating even more efficient operations throughout our geographically diverse platform maintaining consistent strength in our balance sheet sourcing accretive investments and expanding wade jurney homes in the carefully selected areas i will now turn the call over to dave who will provide greater detail on our financial results and outlook david l messenger chief financial officer thank you rob in the fourth quarter of 2018 we continue to improve our revenues and made improvements across our key operating metrics our adjusted net income grew to 34 4 million or 1 11 per diluted share compared to 1 01 per diluted share in the prior year quarter our full year adjusted net income was 119 9 million or 3 94 per share an increase of 69 compared to 71 1 million or 2 87 per share in the prior year net income for the quarter increased to 26 2 million or 0 85 per share and net income for the full year nearly doubled to 96 5 million or 3 17 per share ebitda in the fourth quarter increased by 13 to 54 4 million and 53 to 189 3 million for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 grew 10 to 64 2 million compared to 58 6 million in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda for the full year was 227 9 million up 51 compared to 150 5 million in 2017 gross margin for the fourth quarter was 16 5 as a result of purchase price accounting adjustments the use of incentives and the cost inflation trends during the first three quarters of 2018 when these homes were contracted adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 20 4 compared to 21 7 in the prior year quarter for the full year homebuilding gross margin was 17 5 compared to 17 9 in 2017 and full year 2018 adjusted homebuilding gross margin increased 20 basis points to 21 6 compared to 21 4 in the full year 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred 9 7 million of purchase accounting charges pertaining primarily to the wade jurney homes acquisition in the first quarter of 2019 we expect to incur the remaining 2 million of purchase price accounting adjustments related to the wade jurney homes acquisition sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues improved to a 11 4 in the fourth quarter compared to 12 1 in the prior year quarter the 80 basis point improvement was primarily due to process enhancements and overall disciplined cost controls and scale benefits derived from our homebuilding platform reducing our sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues will remain one of our primary focus items in 2019 during 2018 we made significant progress in expanding our financial services subsidiary which consists of mortgage title services and insurance in the fourth quarter of 2018 the business contributed 3 3 million in pre tax income with 10 4 million of revenue compared to 1 1 million of pre tax income on 5 2 million of revenue in the prior year quarter for the full year financial services pre tax income increased 8 8 million compared to 1 2 million in 2017 now turning to our balance sheet and liquidity during the fourth quarter of 2018 we initiated a 4 5 million share repurchase program and we repurchased approximately 687 000 shares at a weighted average price of 17 99 per share as of december 31 2018 we had total debt of 1 1 billion with total liquidity of 445 million including 57 million of cash and 388 million of availability on our unsecured revolver with 859 million of stockholders equity our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio stood at 52 at december 31 marking a 170 basis point improvement from 53 7 at the end of the third quarter as dale and rob mentioned we have a solid balance sheet with 38 000 lots spread across a diverse national portfolio with a focus on lower price point homes we have invested in markets that still exhibit positive long term fundamentals however due to the limited near term visibility in the overall housing market we will not be providing full year guidance until we see meaningful unpredictable demand trends we would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work during 2018 as we look forward to delivering quality homes to our customers while driving additional value for all of our stakeholders in the quarters and years to come operator please open the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting the question and answer session operator instructions our first question is from the line of jay mccanless with wedbush please proceed with your question jay your line is live you may proceed jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst sorry about that can you guys talk about january what you saw from order trends and traffic and how has how incentives trended since the end of 2018 dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman sure jay this is dale as we approached q4 last year we instituted additional incentives on specs that were scheduled to complete in the last quarter of the year as we near the end of this november we began reducing those incentives what we experienced was an increase in year over year sales in both october and november but with the reduced incentives december sales declined year over year this trend continued into january however toward the end of january and so far in february we ve really seen increased traffic in sales and so when we look at what transpired in december and january or the first part of january we re feeling a lot better as we sit here today than we did at that point jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst got it and then maybe if we could touch on the southeast for a minute it sounds like atlanta is kind of a tale of two markets with some communities doing well and some not could you maybe dig down into that market a little further and how much of the weakness year over year and the order growth was driven by atlanta robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director unfortunately right now in the market it s i don t know if i can tell you that it s a tale of two cities it really across our portfolio it s kind of a tale of subdivision by subdivision and so when we look at it some of our sub divisions are slower than we d like and some are certainly performing according to expectations so i wouldn t isolate atlanta and say it s any different than what we re experiencing in other markets jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst the next question i had it looks based on the historical data you guys provided when after the wade jurney acquisition closed it looks like orders were down 10 for wade in 3q it looks like they re down 34 if i ve got my math right in 4q can you talk to us about the shift in strategy and what is weighing on order growth and presumably community growth for the wade jurney division right now robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director it s really order growth and as we talked about in the prepared remarks it s a shift that we made when wade jurney homes was a private company that had secured financing one of the requirements that they had was that they couldn t have very many specs so as a result what was being done is homes were sold oftentimes before we ever started construction and so what we did is we just push that later into the construction cycle as opposed to marketing and selling homes before we start construction since this is spec based business model we ve just pushed to downstream as we look at it we re not anticipating that that s going to impact our closings and we monitor our finished specs and as we indicated in the prepared remarks they re less than 3 of the homes that we have under construction in that business jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst got it robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director so it s really it was really an intentional shift on the sales side jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then dave could you maybe give us some insight into where you think gross margin and sg a margin are going to be for 1q david l messenger chief financial officer i d say for gross margin we are not providing any guidance in terms of how that s going to shake out and it really depends on the utilization of incentives and how that plays out from an sg a standpoint you can see that we put a lot of things into place during 2018 and we saw q4 sg a as a percent of revenue go down not only was it down as a percent but also our actual dollars on the fixed side were down sequentially from q3 to q4 and so we are not putting a percentage on i would expect that we would still see progress being made in 2019 so as sg a we would expect would come in lower than it did in 2018 jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst great thanks for taking my question dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman yes thanks jay operator thank you our next question is from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut jp morgan analyst thanks good afternoon everyone first question i guess i just wanted to obviously understandably like many of your peers withholding 2019 guidance at this time i guess i just wanted to perhaps get a little bit in terms of some basic goal post also perhaps some of your peers in terms of maybe how to think about things one of which if i heard you right you ended 2018 with did i hear that right 142 century communities robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director that s correct michael rehaut jp morgan analyst and so i m just curious obviously let s say it is all scenario based on current demand trends but if you can kind of share let s say the market doesn t take another major step down it doesn t take a major step up if you could perhaps share what you re thinking in terms of where we see that 122 go by the end of 2019 if you could give us any type of rough directional guidance i think in the past you ve talked about your core business maybe growing 10 on or off i don t know if that s a good place to start or if it should be a little bit lower given your greater size any thoughts there would be helpful robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director yes we would expect we have a variety of communities that we have planned to open and we would expect that at the end of 19 that our community count would be up slightly whether it s going to be up 10 or not there s a lot of water that has to go under the bridge but we would expect that we would have at least slightly positive community count growth during 2019 michael rehaut jp morgan analyst so up slightly to me reads more or like zero to five is that fair 10 does not sound 5 robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director when we look at it if at 122 10 is another 12 communities we could easily be up that but on the other hand if we were up six then it s only 5 but i don t think it s i don t think it s out of the question that we re up 10 i think we struggle with some of the same things that our peers do in that getting communities open sometimes takes longer than we anticipated it s going to do either because of weather or labor constraints but i think it s very possible that we could be at 10 as 10 up by time we get to the end of the year michael rehaut jp morgan analyst i appreciate that i guess secondly just going back to the gross margin for a moment again understanding if not wanted to provide full year but a lot of your peers have also kind of directionally pointed to the first quarter notwithstanding jay s question from before but the typical type of sequential decline in gross margins that we ve come across from the other builders have been in and around i mean it could range anywhere from 50 to as much as 150 or more type of a sequential gross margin decline from 4q to 1q you noted that you ve also like other builders have increased incentives during the fourth quarter and i assume you re more or less matching the market so i mean is it reasonable to think that 100 bps of a sequential gross margin decline is kind of in the card could it be more or less robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director that would not surprise me when we look at it as i said earlier we started backing off the concessions as we approach the beginning of december and we haven t felt the need to bring them back to the same level that we had them but a lot of that s going to depend on how traffic and sales continue going through but i would expect that we would see some downward movement in q1 and then at that point hopefully it stabilizes and continues to build back up to more normal levels michael rehaut jp morgan analyst great thank you and then just one last one if i could just on the shift of wade jurney just in terms of selling the homes more into the construction process i just wanted to make sure i understood the standards right are you doing that shift i guess there is two questions around this one are you doing that shift so that you re trying to better match material costs and labor costs with the pricing that you re offering number one what s the rationale behind that and number two just to understand also that while this might kind of inaudible a little bit with the orders that you are reporting you re not expecting any major changes from a closing standpoint in terms of the impact of this specific shift robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director both those comments or accurate mike i mean we re doing it because we want to make sure that when we sell a house that we have that house priced and in some cases you can t do that with everything if you re selling it before you start the house it also gives us better control over our backlog because we have the homebuyer under contract a shorter period of time and then the last comment that i ll reiterate is what you said is that is we do not expect that that s going to impact our closings so as a result from our standpoint it just makes complete sense without any real downside at all michael rehaut jp morgan analyst great thanks a lot robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director sure operator thank you our next question is from the line of thomas maguire with zelman associates please proceed with your question thomas maguire zelman associates analyst hey guys nice job navigating a tough environment here just to take the wade jurney discussion one step further i know we ve been really focused on expanding into different markets with that business and presumably that s generating some volume can you just help us think about what s going on maybe in the legacy markets and what the magnitude of clients there is and then just if we take a step back can you just talk about how you feel about the entry level and just the demand for that product relative to other price points and how it s performing versus your expectations robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director well taking the second part of the question first i mean we re very bullish on the entry level homebuyer and we started the transition several years ago to reduce our asp we re to the point now that we believe that about 75 of our business is price belowed the fha limits in the particular market and so that is the area of our business that we are the most focused on continuing to expand whether that s in the century communities brand or the wade jurney homes brand and so we have seen over time that there is resilience in that market we think there is more pricing power there over time and that s where we have been heading and we continue to keep heading in that direction thomas maguire zelman associates analyst got it and then can you maybe just talk about the comments you made on incentives and pulling them back through the quarter and that affecting demand just what s the kind of discussion that happens to get to that decision or maybe said another way what would cause you guys to increase incentives to incrementally drive growth from today s levels understanding january was down robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director it s really a function of what we need to do to drive sales as we look at our looked at our incentives we were i had them primarily on homes that could close in q4 so as we began approaching december the windows started closing rather rapidly for homes that we could sell and still close so we didn t feel the need to continuing to incent them to the same level into january we didn t add the incentives back on because january is a really tough time to sell homes particularly when we looked at what was going on in the overall homebuilding market with the hesitation in buyers and we candidly felt that markets would improve as we guide into the spring time and the government opened back up and all these other things and we just felt that in the long run we could sell the number of homes that we needed to as they approach completion and start with some margin as we went through thomas maguire zelman associates analyst got it thanks robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director sure operator thank you the next question is from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please proceed with your question timothy daley deutsche bank analyst hi this is tim daley on for nishu thanks for the time so my first one is just quickly on wade did you guys do any concessions on wade product in the quarter i m just seeing the backlogs down a little bit and just on that same kind of thread is that due to the new markets you re mixing into or something to do with the kind of changing spec start schedule robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director no it s we did have some incentives on in that business as well obviously not the same magnitude just given the difference in price point and the change in backlog was really driven by the change in the sales strategy with regard to the timing of when we were going to sell homes timothy daley deutsche bank analyst all right thank you for that color so i guess thinking moving on to the financial services so good job rolling it out nationally and kind of getting into the even the wade brand now so none of the kind of the pieces are in place how should we think about growth in this segment next year and maybe if you could kind of help us out with expected capture rate with how you ended in the fourth quarter or kind of any additional color would be really very helpful david l messenger chief financial officer yes hey tim this is dave i think from the financial services standpoint we ve been pleased with the growth that we are able to achieve in 2018 and as we ve been rolling out we rolled out middle of the year into the west coast markets as we terminated some legacy relationships they had there in inspire started taking over that and just here in the fourth quarter really near the end of the year we started up with the wade jurney brand and it s enrolling out there so right now we would say that we re priced still building an overall capture rate some of our legacy markets where we ve been around 15 16 months here in the mountain region more in the 60 to 70 mid 70 range on a capture rate the rest of the markets we were still building up to what we would consider to be kind of a target of somewhere in that 60 to 75 range timothy daley deutsche bank analyst all right that sounds very promising so and then final question here is capital allocation so you announced the buyback plan last quarter you did some solid buybacks this quarter and at the same time you got the leverage down to that kind of more in line with historical levels so now that you ve got leverage kind of where it s been in the past how are you thinking about capital allocation heading into 19 particularly kind of balancing any additional deleveraging future buybacks and then obviously land investment david l messenger chief financial officer yes this is dave i think that we look at our balance sheet and always going to maintain it to be fairly solid and strong we do have a long term goal of 50 from a leverage perspective and i think that as the investments we ve made over the past 18 months two years from ucp through wade jurney as those continue to mature and generate returns that will help us naturally delever when it comes to stock buybacks obviously we re successful in the fourth quarter and repurchasing nearly 700 000 shares we ll look at that all the time as another way to drive value for our stockholders and when it comes to capital allocation among the division we think that our portfolio and the products that we re offering is diverse enough that where we put the next dollar we re going to be able to generate the greatest returns timothy daley deutsche bank analyst got it thanks for the time robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director welcome david l messenger chief financial officer thanks tim operator thank you the next question is from the line of alex rygiel with b riley please proceed with your question alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst thanks for taking my question coming back to the wade jurney business sounds like you re entering a number of new markets in the short term how should we think about growth in that business category in 2019 versus 2018 should it be on a state by state basis should be on a community basis how should we think about growth dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman i think it s a little bit it s going to be a combination of several things right now as you re thinking about growth i would look at probably our historical backlog conversion rates for some form of proxy for growth for this year when it comes to sales we will be providing further guidance for you on that hopefully later in the year as we get a little bit more visibility into what the homebuyers are going to be doing and then additionally the new markets that we rolled out into last year those didn t have a significant impact in 2018 we d expect to see them play a little bit more of a role in 2019 alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst then when we d look to think about that business how many offices do you have now or sales centers do you have now versus pre merger dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman we got about 20 25 different sales offices right now and it s about static with where we were pre merger we ve had some closed we ve opened up a couple of new ones alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst that s helpful and then any comment on how weather might have impacted customer traffic either in the fourth quarter or in the month of january dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman it s when we look at it unfortunately we re always at the mercy of weather when we look at it given just our national platform somewhere we are going to be impacted by weather and so hopefully we ve got enough diversity now that it s not something that is going to be that detrimental to us in any one place unless it s something really unusual but it general it will impact us but hopefully we can overcome it with other geographies alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst thank you very much dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman welcome operator thank you our next question is from the line of alex barron with housing research center please proceed with your question alex barron housing research center analyst thank you hey guys i was hoping you could comment on your various regions just in general how you guys are thinking about how the year started off which regions are looking more promising and which ones are still little slower robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director well ending the fourth quarter the west region was the slowest on a year over year basis that as actually picked up slightly this year we feel a little bit encouraged with the west region based on where we finished last year at so again it s still too early to tell but it s looking more promising than we may have thought when we look at our mountain region that s continue to performed based on expectations our texas region has been really one of the bright spots spots alex and part of that is not just market driven but our strategy to go to the lower price points within the texas market and that s starting to pay dividends as we re getting into those projects that can offer that true entry level price point and a well located project and so that as you saw in the fourth quarter that s really the one region that we were up on a year over year basis quite significantly so again we feel good about that in the southeast again as dale mentioned a lot of it is based on subdivision by subdivision and we ve got some that we re doing very well in and others that are more challenging and more sanitized but again it s still early in the year but we re more encouraged now as we sit here in february than we were obviously a month ago even alex barron housing research center analyst now when you talk about the different challenges community which means especially in the southeast is that more having to do with price points or location robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director generally price points alex barron housing research center analyst got it and are your incentives also i guess more focused on those higher price points then robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director yes again that s the incentives as we ve seen as a general statement or commensurate with price points and as dale mentioned earlier on the wade jurney model we have had some incentives on that business model in the fourth quarter but they were very small in comparison and it relates to the price point where we ve had larger incentives on some of our highest higher price point offerings in our other regions so it s really on a price point driven basis alex barron housing research center analyst okay great thank you very much operator thank you we do have a follow up question from the line of jay mccanless with wedbush please proceed with your question jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks for taking my follow up just a couple of foot points number one we ve heard some of your competitors talk about lumber prices coming in and that potentially being a gross margin tailwind how are you guys thinking about it and if it is when should we expect that to hit ph dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman i mean we re seeing the same thing some of the homes a lot of the homes actually that closed in q4 were bought out previously at higher lumber numbers lumber is down and again it down what component you re looking at but as much as 25 and that definitely is a tailwind we see that coming into play especially on the quicker build entry level product that we can get up and close quickly we see that coming into play in the latter part of q1 and certainly into q2 jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then just wondering some of the travel we done we ve seen that there is maybe in excess in some communities or some markets and not just for century but all the builders of steaming speculative inventory how are you guys feeling about your finished specs right now do you feel like you need to be more aggressive on that and is that something that may continue to weigh on the gross margin as you work in that number now dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman from a consolidated basis for century both the century brand and wade jurney brand we don t have a lot of completed specs with that said though we are cautious on what specs we re starting which communities we re doing that in and we re just taking a much more conservative approach to that than maybe we would have done a year ago but we re not seeing that from our business standpoint as a problem to gross margin headwinds robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director and jay that s one of the reasons that we felt we could back off on the incentives in december because we were focused on homes that could close in q4 and we looked at what we had we didn t have a lot of inventory that was completed or completing that we felt we had to continue to incent jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay got it and then on to be built were incentives running on those right now and how does that compare to maybe a year ago and year end david l messenger chief financial officer on to be built the incentives are right now running generally less than what you ll see on a spec and so when we look back a year ago it s kind of hard to compare to that but it s probably not a lot higher now than it was then jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay thanks again dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman you re welcome david l messenger chief financial officer thanks jay operator thank you it appears there are no further questions at this time so i d like to pass the floor back over to dale francescon for any additional concluding comments dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman thank you

look to the remainder of the year we continue to expect cae to deliver on its annual outlook said marc parent cae s president and chief executive officer operating income was lower year over year in

defence operating income and margins compared to the third quarter last year defence experienced higher r d expenses related to recent development programs and it had delays in the advancement of higher margin programs including the canadian fixed wing search and rescue and the uae naval training centre the company has already taken measures to mitigate these timing related impacts in the

growth in fiscal year 2019 in civil the company expects to continue generating low double digit percentage operating income growth as current momentum for its innovative training solutions translates into market share gains and new training customer partnerships as well civil expects to maintain its leadership position in ffs sales and to receive approximately 70 orders in fiscal 2019 in defence the company continues to expect mid to high single digit percentage operating income growth as it delivers from backlog and continues to win opportunities from a large pipeline cae expects healthcare to resume double digit growth this year with its broader market reach expanded offering and the continued launch of innovative products the company expects revenue and profit to be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year owing to the impact of the adoption of ifrs 15 as it relates to simulator product deliveries and a five week work disruption which preceded the successful negotiation of a new collective agreement with cae s manufacturing employees in canada the company has successfully accelerated production to mitigate the impact of this action and expects to deliver a record number of simulators in the last quarter of its fiscal year funding growth opportunities remains cae s top capital allocation priority and continues to be driven by and supportive of growing customer training outsourcings in its large core markets cae currently expects total annual capital expenditures to reach approximately 250 million in fiscal 2019 cae prioritizes market led capital investments

prevailing positive market conditions and customer receptivity to cae s training solutions as well as material assumptions contained in this press release quarterly md a and in cae s fiscal year 2018 md a ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers effective april 1 2018 cae adopted ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers which changes the way the company recognizes revenue for certain of its customer contracts the main impact of ifrs 15 to cae is the timing of revenue recognized for certain training devices that were previously accounted for using the percentage of completion method that no longer meet the requirements for revenue recognition over time revenue for these training devices are instead recognized upon completion while this change impacts the timing of contract revenue and profit recognition there are no changes to cash flows from the contract the financial results reported in the press release for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 have been restated to

modest economic growth and moderately rising interest rates in fiscal 2019 a sustained level of competition in civil defence healthcare markets no material financial operational or competitive consequences of changes in regulations affecting our business and a continued positive defence market assumptions concerning our businesses a number of assumptions concerning cae s business were also made in the preparation of its forward looking statements for fiscal 2019 contained in this news release including but not limited to factors including maintenance of cae s market share in civil simulator sales in the face of price competition and cae s ability to increase market share in training the foregoing assumptions although considered reasonable by cae on february 8 2019 may prove to be inaccurate accordingly our actual results could differ materially from our expectations as set forth in this news release material risks important risk factors that could cause our assumptions and estimates to be inaccurate and actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our forward looking statements including our fiscal 2019 financial guidance are set out in cae s md a for the year ended march 31 2018 filed by cae with the canadian securities administrators available at www sedar com and with the u s securities and exchange commission available at www sec gov the fiscal year 2018 md a is also available at www cae com the realization of our forward looking statements including our ability to meet our fiscal 2019 outlook essentially depends on our business performance which in turn is subject to many risks accordingly readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward looking statements we caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results non gaap and other financial measures this press release includes non gaap and other financial measures non gaap measures are useful supplemental information but may not have a standardized meaning according to gaap these measures should not be confused with or used as an alternative for performance measures calculated according to gaap they should also not be used to compare with similar measures from other companies management believes that providing certain non gaap measures provides users with a better understanding of our results and trends and provides additional information on our financial and operating performance 1 free cash flow is a non gaap measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations we use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity we calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities subtracting maintenance capital expenditures investment in other assets not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds net of payments from equity accounted investees 2 order intake and backlog order intake is a non gaap measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received for the civil aviation training solutions segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract additionally expected future revenues from customers under short term and long term training contracts are included when these customers commit to pay us training fees or when we reasonably expect the revenue to be generated for the defence and security segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract defence and security contracts are usually executed over a long term period but some of them must be renewed each year for this segment we only include a contract item in order intake when the customer has authorized the contract item and has received funding for it for the healthcare segment order intake is typically converted into revenue within one year therefore we assume that order intake is equal to revenue the book to sales ratio is the total orders divided by total revenue in a given period total backlog is a non gaap measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options obligated backlog represents the value of our order intake not yet executed and is calculated by adding the order intake of the current period to the balance of the obligated backlog at the end of the previous fiscal year subtracting the revenue recognized in the current period and adding or subtracting backlog adjustments if the amount of an order already recognized in a previous fiscal year is modified the backlog is revised through adjustments joint venture backlog is obligated backlog that represents the expected value of our share of orders that our joint ventures have received but have not yet executed joint venture backlog is determined on the same basis as obligated backlog described above unfunded backlog represents firm defence and security orders we have received but have not yet executed and for which funding authorization has not yet been obtained options are included in backlog when there is a high probability of being exercised but indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts are excluded when an option is exercised it is considered order intake in that period and it is removed from unfunded backlog and options 3 operating profit is an additional gaap measure that shows us how we have performed before the effects of certain financing decisions tax structures and discontinued operations we track it because we believe it makes it easier to compare our performance with previous periods and with companies and industries that do not have the same capital structure or tax laws 4 segment operating income soi is a non gaap measure and is our key indicator of each segment s financial performance segment operating income gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment s performance we calculate total segment operating income by taking the operating profit and excluding the impact of restructuring integration and acquisition costs 5 utilization rate is one of the operating measures we use to assess the performance of our civil simulator training network while utilization rate does not directly correlate to revenue recognized we track it together with other measures because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance we calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period 6 simulator equivalent unit seu is an operating measure we use to show the total average number of ffss available to generate earnings during the period 7 maintenance capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity growth capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity 8 net debt is a non gaap measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents we use it as an indicator of our overall financial position and calculate it by taking our total long term debt including the current portion of long term debt and subtracting cash and cash equivalents 9 net debt to capital is calculated as net debt divided by the sum of total equity plus net debt 10 return on capital employed roce is a non gaap measure we use to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital we calculate this ratio over a rolling four quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the company excluding net finance expense after tax divided by the average capital employed for non gaap and other financial measures monitored by cae please refer to cae s md a filed with the canadian securities administrators available on our website www cae com

the time has come for investors to consider protecting against emerging market losses according to three of the world s biggest banks after a strong start to the year societe generale sa bank of america corp and wells fargo co are questioning how much value is left in developing nations while flagging the potential pitfalls to the goldilocks story that gained so many adherents while riskier assets benefited from the more dovish turn by the federal reserve global growth is still a major source of concern as prospects for an extension of a u s trade truce with china are fading not to mention the widespread consensus is still bullish em s structural weaknesses will reemerge from the dark sooner rather than later bank of america strategists including london based david hauner wrote in a note to clients we strongly advise looking for well priced hedges mexico s peso the mexican peso has historically been used as a proxy for emerging market currencies given its round the clock trading relatively good liquidity and the country s export oriented economy after rallying for nine straight weeks through jan 25 the longest winning streak in two decades peso gains appear to have stalled and shorting the currency may turn into a popular trade in case of a wider selloff bank of america strategists recommend buying usd mxn calls and mexico cds for hedging instead of simply going long dollar peso spot one barrier against short peso wagers is that the benchmark rate stands at a decade high making it costly to bet against the currency given it s high carry hedge for recession societe generale s jason daw the singapore based strategist who was one of the few to anticipate the slump in emerging markets last year says investors should hedge against a u s recession that may come in the first half of 2020 according to the bank s economists judging by past moves at times of economic weakness in the u s investors should favor the indian rupee the south korean won or the taiwanese dollars as hedges timing the u s recession or judging the magnitude of the u s global slowdown is not easy daw wrote in a report to clients but when it starts having some recession hedge ideas in the back pocket can prove useful brazil frenzy investors need to identify where the market rally has got ahead of itself because those assets will be the first to decline for wells fargo brazil is one case where investors have become excessively optimistic the real is among the best performing currencies this year on expectations the new administration of president jair bolsonaro will pass an unpopular social security reform privatize state owned companies and revive growth now would be a good time to hedge emfx risk especially for some of the currencies that are still fragile said brendan mckenna a currency strategist at wells fargo in new york brazil is a good example i have a longer term bearish view on the real and would say now would be a good time to put a hedge on as the real has strengthened a fair amount he recommends using brazilian real forward contracts or credit default swaps to hedge as the spreads hover near a one year low and would likely blow out if the reform agenda hits any roadblocks hedging against the turkish lira and the argentine peso weakness is also a good idea if the investor doesn t mind the cost since it is pretty expensive now he adds

overview as north american traders return to their posts to put the finishing touches on the week s activity the is extending its advance for a seventh consecutive session if sustained it will be the longest advance since february 2017 the rally was sparked after the dovish had sent the greenback lower and the employment data raised the possibility that the fed overreacted to the stock market volatility the turned back from the 200 day moving average and gapped lower yesterday 2719 2724 setting the tone for the still holiday thinned asian markets where the fell for a third session to snap a four week rally european shares are faring better and dow jones is poised to extend its streak for the sixth week benchmark bond yields are mostly a little lower oil is trading heavily and with for march delivery near 52 40 it is off more than 5 this week the largest decline since late december on the other hand the shock from vale is still behind iron ore s surge today s 5 rally bring it to a five year high asia pacific when the reserve bank of australia left and did not appear to change its stance much the australian dollar traded firm but subsequent clarification has seen the tumble governor lowe s neutral bias was quantified in today s monetary policy statement growth and inflation forecast were cut the australian economy is expected to grow 2 5 in the year through june down from 3 25 previously and growth in the following year was cut by half a percentage point to 2 75 the softer inflation forecast was attributed to oil with core inflation remaining near 2 the forecasts would suggest an easing bias rather than a neutral stance that lowe claims yet the rba still seems to be counting on the strength the job growth to boost wages and inflation the underlying issue is whether the weakness in property prices will crimp consumption and growth australia s 10 year bond yield fell 13 bp this week to 2 10 the record low was set in august 2016 near 1 80 japan s december current account surplus seasonally adjusted was broadly in line with expectations a key point to remember is that japan s current account surplus is not driven by the trade balance as much as the investment income balance consider the trade surplus on the balance of payments basis was about jpy216 bln while the seasonally adjusted current account surplus was roughly jpy1 56 trillion separately and arguably more importantly japan reported the first increase in overall household spending since august it eked out a 0 1 rise year over year in december on the other hand japan s leading economic indicator fell for a fourth month in december and at 97 9 it is at the lowest level since october 2016 the dollar s range for the week against the japanese yen was set on monday jpy109 45 jpy110 15 thus far today is the first day this week the dollar has not traded above jpy110 where a 640 mln option expires today the market does not appear to have given up on trying to establish a hand hold above jpy110 though it would seem to require stronger equities and or higher yields the australian dollar is off about 2 4 this week 0 7075 the next downside target is near 0 7020 the new zealand dollar also has sold off this week and its 2 2 decline 0 6750 is the largest since august europe the made a marginal new low for the week dipping below 1 1325 briefly the pessimism toward emu was not changed by today s data which on balance was a bit better than expected italy s was not december industrial output slumped 0 8 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a 0 4 rise however news from france was better french industrial production was expected to rise 0 6 instead it rose 0 8 and manufacturing output itself was up 1 0 this recoups most of the weakness since in november for its part germany reported a considerably smaller trade surplus 13 9 bln euro in december vs 20 4 bln euros in november but more importantly imports and exports recovered smartly after falling 0 3 in november exports rose 1 5 imports rose 1 2 after falling 1 3 in november uk prime minister may is still asking for some dilution in the plan for the irish backstop even though everyone has said not indeed the backstop is in case no agreement is reached there cannot be a time limit or it undermines the very purpose of the backstop it would encourage delay tactics until the time limit passed meanwhile a vote in parliament that was expected next week looks likely to be delayed although everyone says they want to avoid a no deal exit it can still be stumbled into and that continues to worry investors if the euro s losses are sustained it will be the first week since may 2018 that it has fallen in each session yet all that has happened is that the euro has gone from the upper end of its range 1 15 to the lower end of its range 1 13 indeed it should not be surprising for the euro to snap its losing streak and close higher ahead of the weekend large option expires today 1 1280 and 1 1380 do not seem particularly relevant but there is a 2 0 bln euro option struck at 1 1365 on monday that may be interesting sterling is trading higher for the second day in a row but it won t be enough to prevent the second consecutive weekly loss yesterday s losses nearly fulfilled a retracement objective 50 of the rally since the flash crash in early january that is found near 1 2830 its recovery suggests that perhaps some move was completed on the upside a move through yesterday s high near 1 30 would confirm a more constructive near term technical outlook america trade talk optimism was hit yesterday president trump apparently indicated that there will be no meeting with china s president xi before the early march deadline economic adviser kudlow s assessment that there were still sizeable differences gave the sense that the lack of substantial progress was the reason the two presidents won t meet rather than a schedule conflict at the same time the battle over chinese telecom companies continues and formal action in the us will be forthcoming meanwhile germany is balking and is opposed to banning huawei for example this will likely server to exacerbate tensions as the us europe trade talks move into focus the unctad found that europe is poised to benefit the most from us china trade tensions though as a percentage of trade mexico vietnam australia and brazil

m delighted to report another outstanding quarter and year for our company these results are a testament to the hard work of the entire radian team across all of our businesses from mortgage insurance and risk services to title mortgage and real estate services i d like to take a moment now to recognize the team and to thank our customers investors and business partners for helping us deliver such exceptional results 2018 was a year where we delivered on our strategy in a consistent manner but also celebrated several first for the company we wrote 56 billion of flow niw which set a company record for highest flow volume in our more than 40 year history net premiums earned exceeded 1 billion and we grew primary insurance in force 10 year over year to 221 billion we executed the mortgage industry s first ever simultaneous iln and xol reinsurance placement which has enhanced our capital efficiency and strengthened our risk profile we improved our financial flexibility with a 450 million return on capital from radian guaranty to radian group and we ve aligned all of our businesses and products under the radian brand to reflect the combined strength of our unified team and these are just a few highlights from an outstanding year before i turn the call over to frank to cover our financial position i d like to take the opportunity to review some of our other topics in terms of financial performance net income for the fourth quarter grew to 140 million or 0 64 per share net income for the full year 2018 was 606 million or 2 77 per share adjusted diluted net operating income per share increased 48 year over year to 2 69 return on equity was 18 7 and adjusted net operating return on equity was 18 2 for 2018 in terms of our mortgage insurance business we wrote 12 7 billion of niw in the fourth quarter which as i mentioned earlier contributed to our record breaking volume of new flow business written in 2018 of 56 5 billion this is our third consecutive year of record breaking annual volume and we are pleased with the projected economic value of this new business which we expect to provide significant earnings and attractive returns for shareholders given our projections based on industry forecasts including a slight decline in the overall mortgage origination market but a modest increase in purchase originations we expect to write new mi business in 2019 in the range of 50 billion this would be in line with a record breaking levels of niw we have achieved over the past three years and similar to our guidance a year ago as i ve said before this is a great time to be in the mortgage insurance business the business fundamentals are incredibly strong supported by an excellent credit environment and with guardrails in place for mortgage lending and servicing under dodd frank and our mortgage insurance industry is governed by clear consistent and transparent risk based capital requirements under pmiers and operating guidelines with a uniform master policy there is also continued demand for private mortgage insurance looking ahead to 2019 industry projections suggests a mortgage origination market that is relatively flat to 2018 but with a 4 increase in purchase loans this is a positive trend for our mortgage insurance industry given the purchase loans are three to five times more likely to have mi versus a refinance loan during this past quarter purchase loans accounted for 95 of our niw housing demand is also expected to remain strong given more stability in both mortgage rates and home price growth coupled with expected wage growth this combination provides for a stable and healthy real estate market during our last earnings call we discussed how the mortgage insurance industry was continuing to evolve away from a pure rate card pricing model to an environment where mi market participants will deploy a variety of pricing methodologies at radian while our pricing options are all risk based in nature they have different levels of granularity and are delivered to our customers based on their individual needs and loan origination processes just last month we introduced radar rates an mi pricing option where each rate quote is finally tuned to a borrowers individual risk profile and loan attributes this increased granularity allows us to more dynamically shape the risk profile of our mi portfolio and ultimately the economic value of the business that we write we believe that the combination of flexible pricing options excellent customer service and outstanding business relationships is the right market strategy to both address our customers needs and provide an attractive risk adjusted return for radian after only a few weeks into market radar rate is gaining is already gaining traction among our customers and those for those who have chosen to adopt it the transition has been seamless turning to our mortgage insurance portfolio our record new business volume combined with favorable persistency drove a 10 increase in our mortgage insurance in force portfolio year over year our 221 billion mortgage insurance portfolio which is one of the largest in our industry is the primary driver of our future earnings for the company it is important to note that the projected economic value of this portfolio is not reflected in the current period financial statements nor is it reflected in our reported book value but it is expected to be recognized over time importantly the value for this portfolio provides us with significant strategic financial flexibility we continue to benefit from positive credit trends in 2018 webcast slide nine includes a breakdown of our total mortgage insurance portfolio which illustrates this positive credit environment and its impact on our company today 94 of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force including harp loans consist of business written after 2008 and it s important to highlight that the performing loans in the remaining pre 2009 portfolio also include harp loans more than half has never been in default now moving to our services segment we made great progress during 2018 and focusing title mortgage and real estate services on our core products and capabilities our services segment generated positive services adjusted ebitda across each quarter of 2018 with revenue and services adjusted ebitda margin in line with our guidance for the second half of 2018 we remain confident we have the customer relationships and team in place to grow revenues increase the financial contribution and build value across the segment consistent with radian s growth and diversification strategy during the year we increased our core capabilities through three small but strategic acquisitions these new companies help to increase our footprint across our core title mortgage and real estate services adding new real estate information valuation and risk management tools to our existing product suite as well as proprietary disruptive technologies data analytics and predictive models in a competitive mortgage insurance market we continue to believe that these capabilities uniquely position us with our customers in terms of capital management as we reported this morning the pennsylvania insurance department approved a 450 million return on capital from radian guaranty to radian group during the fourth quarter of 2018 this return of capital is part of our long term capital plan which is designed to improve our financial flexibility and capital position for example we plan to use a portion of these proceeds to retire our 159 million of senior notes with due in june of 2019 during our last earnings call we announced the launch of a capital markets transaction which was the mortgage insurance industry s first simultaneous mortgage insurance linked notes and excess of loss insurance placement we believe there are a number of strategic benefits from leveraging and regularly assessing both the capital and reinsurance markets to distribute risk including increased financial flexibility a reduction of our overall cost of capital enhance capital efficiency and most importantly the opportunity to reduce portfolio and financial volatility through economic cycles we believe the execution of our capital plan will enhance our already strong capital structure and further demonstrate our commitment to effectively manage capital for our shareholders we look forward to providing updates on our progress turning to the regulatory and legislative landscape we remain actively engaged with key legislators in washington on the topics most important to our company and we continue to be encouraged by the support for an increased role for private capital including private mortgage insurance we believe our industry is well positioned for any new housing and finance framework that may develop however it remains difficult to determine exactly what shape that framework will ultimately take and when we are also closely following the upcoming change in leadership at the fhfa while we do not know what actions this change may bring we do know that mark calabria has been nominated and is awaiting confirmation as fhfa director while joe otting of the occ is the acting director both issuing support for an increased role of private capital and for reducing taxpayer exposure finally we believe that our industry continues to gain share from the fha on higher fica business and that it remains unlikely that the fha will reduce its pricing the fha s focus appears to be on modernizing its internal systems and processes now i would like to turn the call over to frank for details of our financial position j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer thank you rick and good morning everyone to recap our financial results reported earlier this morning we reported net income of 139 8 million or 0 64 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 0 66 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018 and 0 03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 full year 2018 net income was 606 million or 2 77 per diluted share compared to 121 1 million or 0 55 per diluted share for the full year 2017 the year over year increase was primarily driven by the 2017 impact of an incremental tax provision of 102 6 million resulting from the tax law change as well as the pre tax impairment of goodwill and other required intangible assets related to our services segment of 200 2 million adjusted diluted net operating income was 0 70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 1 to the third quarter of 2018 an increase of 37 over the same quarter last year adjusted diluted net operating income for the full year 2018 was 2 69 a 48 increase over prior year i will now focus on some of the drivers of our adjusted diluted net operating results for the quarter and the full year i ll start with the key drivers of our revenue our new insurance written was 12 7 billion during the quarter compared to 15 8 billion last quarter and 14 4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 we wrote 56 5 billion of niw a 5 increase over full year 2017 in addition to record volume we continue to enhance the product mix of our new business monthly and other renewal premium niw represented 83 of our niw this quarter on a full year basis monthly premium niw increased 7 in 2018 compared to 2017 borrower paid single premium policies represented 12 of our niw this quarter while lender paid single premium policies declined to 5 of our volume this quarter a year ago nearly all of our single premium niw was lender paid this shift in business mix is expected intentional and designed to improve the return profile of our single premium business overall as borrower paid singles have higher expected returns than lender paid policies in total borrower paid policies represented 94 of our new business for the fourth quarter the new business we are writing today continues to consist of loans that are expected to produce excellent risk adjusted returns primary insurance in force increased to 221 4 billion at the end of the quarter our fourth excuse me our fourth consecutive quarter with year over year insurance in force growth of 10 it is important to note that monthly premium insurance in force increased 12 year over year and has grown by over 29 billion over the past two years as rick previously mentioned the in force portfolio is the primary source of our future earned premiums and as such is expected to generate future earnings that are not reflected in the current period financial statements nor reflected in our reported book value the economic value of our portfolio is expected to be recognized in the book value over time persistency trends remain positive and our 12 month persistency rate increased to 83 1 in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 81 4 in the third quarter of 2018 our quarterly persistency was 85 5 this quarter which is the highest level we have observed in recent years our direct in force premium yield was 49 basis points this quarter compared to 48 6 basis points last quarter and 48 1 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 as seen on slide 10 net premium yield decline slightly from 47 8 basis points in the prior quarter to 47 4 basis points this quarter primarily driven by ceded premium associated with our recent iln xol transaction net mortgage insurance premiums earned were 261 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 258 4 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 245 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 this 7 increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to our insurance in force growth on a full year basis net premiums earned exceeded 1 billion and grew by 8 in 2018 compared to 2017 or 10 after adjusting for lower single premium acceleration observed in 2018 compared to 2017 total services segment revenue increased slightly to 41 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 40 9 million for the third quarter of 2018 and 41 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the revenue increases on a linked quarter basis includes 1 5 million of services revenue from our recent acquisition of independent settlement services a national appraisal and title management services company our reported services adjusted ebitda was 3 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding the 1 2 million impact of both restructuring charges and the operating impact of our 2018 acquisitions the services adjusted ebitda would have been 4 4 million it is important to note that since the restructuring of our services businesses in the third quarter of 2017 services adjusted ebitda has been consistently positive and there has been substantial improvements in the operational and financial aspects of the business our investment income this quarter was 42 million an 8 increase over the prior quarter and a 25 increase over prior year due to both higher rates and higher balances in our investment portfolio we are continually looking for ways to enhance the performance of our investment portfolio and apply our management expertise to produce greater investment income while also being mindful of asset and liability duration matching and risk levels moving now to our loss provision and credit quality as noted on slide 14 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we had positive reserve development on prior period defaults of 13 8 million this positive development was driven primarily by a reduction in assumed claim rates on existing defaults based on observed trends including an increase in cure rates on these defaults the default to claim rate applied to new primary defaults received in the quarter which reflects recent observed trends was approximately 8 compared to 8 5 in the third quarter of 2018 and 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we believe that if observed trends continue default to claim rates could fall further over the likelihood and timing of this decline are difficult to predict the total number of new defaults increased by 7 compared to the third quarter of 2018 consistent with typical seasonal patterns and decreased by 31 5 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as a reminder the fourth quarter of 2017 included an elevated level of new defaults in fema designated areas associated with 2017 hurricanes webcast slide 16 shows the defaults trends associated with 2017 fema designated areas over the past five quarters as expected most of the new defaults we received between 2017 of september and february 2018 in these areas has cured and the total default count in these areas has returned to pre hurricane levels as economic indicators have continued their positive trends cumulative loss ratios on our post 2008 business continue to track at historically low levels overall the performance of our portfolio remains strong with positive trends continuing our primary mi risk in force now consists of 94 of business written after 2008 including harp loans and there is greater predictability around the pre 2009 portfolio now turning to expenses other operating expenses were 77 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 70 1 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 66 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the primary drivers of the increase in expenses were higher incentive compensation and benefits based on year to date performance of approximately 5 5 million and incremental expenses related to the operations of businesses acquired in 2018 of approximately 4 1 million moving now to taxes our overall effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 21 and our expectation for 2019 annualized effective tax rate before discrete items is approximately the statutory rate of 21 and now moving to capital as rick mentioned with respect to the capital activities for this quarter in november and as previously announced we closed on an insurance linked note transaction of approximately 434 million and 21 million of additional excess of loss reinsurance for total risk distribution of 455 million assuming continued favorable market conditions we would expect to utilize these forms of risk distribution on a recurring basis going forward and would announce any such actions upon completion we expect that this prudent risk distribution strategy and our disciplined capital management will continue to enhance our risk profile and improve our financial flexibility as a result of a long series of capital enhancement actions and our continued strong financial performance in december 2018 following the approval of the pennsylvania insurance department radian guaranty returned 450 million of capital to its parent radian group the utilization of the enhanced capital flexibility is expected to include retirement of the next maturity of debt which occurs in june 2019 of approximately 159 million and once eliminated would reduce our debt to capital ratio by approximately 4 percentage points bringing our debt to total capital to approximately 20 holding company liquidity at the end of this quarter was 714 million compared to 246 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 the increase in the holding company liquidity during the fourth quarter was primarily due to the 450 million return of capital from radian guaranty under the current pmiers after consideration of this return of capital radian guaranty had available assets of 3 5 billion and our minimum required assets were 2 9 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter 2018 the excess available assets over the minimum required assets of 567 million represents a 19 pmiers cushion and a 37 million increase from the prior quarter we have also noted on slide 20 our pmiers excess available resources on a consolidated basis of 1 5 billion which if fully utilized represents 51 of our minimum required assets we believe that our ongoing risk distribution strategy coupled with organic growth in pmiers available assets should be sufficient to cover a broad range of potential capital actions under pmiers 2 0 as well including contemplation of additional capital distributions from radian guaranty to radian group these actions may include a request of our pennsylvania regulator for a repayment of the 100 million surplus notes and or a request for additional returns of capital after calibrating for an appropriate pmiers cushion at the operating company under the new pmiers 2 0 we expect the pmiers cushion to be sufficient to support projected organic growth and support potential volatility such as a cyclical economic downturn i m sure there will be many questions about our future capital plans but i should remind you that we have demonstrated the ability to execute our capital plan and our practice is to inform you on the elements of this plan as the events occur and we look forward to updating you as our progress continues i will now turn the call back over to rick richard thornberry chief executive officer thank you frank before we open the call to questions i d like to invite those of you who are interested and learning more about radian to join us for an investor day on tuesday may 7 in philadelphia more information will be coming to you shortly now operator we d like to take questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question today comes from the line of randy binner with b riley fbr please go ahead randy binner b riley fbr analyst hi good morning i think i ll start on the capital front and i guess there s two pieces to the question one going back to the iln was that how was that accounted for from kind of a required capital versus absolute capital position meaning it didn t seem like that all went into your capital line but some of it may have been reflected in the required capital for the pmiers calculation and then just the other piece was right at the end of your comments about what would an appropriate cushion maybe look like trying to adjust for the senior notes paydown and the surplus note as well potentially j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer sure thanks for the question randy this is frank so the insurance linked notes are accounted for just as traditional excess of loss reinsurance so when you think about it from a capital perspective especially as it relates to pmiers it s a reduction in the minimum required assets so when we talk about pmiers capital it s really just a reduction in that requirement and so we reflected as such but the accounting of it is identical to excess of loss reinsurance and then i think the second part of your question related to cushions and how we contemplate those going forward and as i shared with you in my prepared remarks it s part of the overall capital planning that we do and as you can see through the fourth quarter we had a lot of activities going on as related to the iln the return of capital from pennsylvania et cetera and then also contemplating what pmiers 2 0 looks like for us as an organization as we put that against our organic growth plans and also taking into account some volatility associated with the potential for an economic downturn so taking all of these things into account it s hard to put a finer number on it but as we look at our projection is to have under as noted on slide 20 is to have if pmiers 2 0 were effective today it would be roughly a 12 cushion and so as you think about it in those the 12 10 15 i mean those types of numbers certainly in the near term feel like an appropriate range but i would just caution you that all of those things are subject to change just simply as we look forward and plan for the unexpected randy binner b riley fbr analyst fair enough the one follow up i have then is you mentioned organic growth plan but the niw you discussed would be down something like 10 and i understand that that s being conservative but is that really the plan that you would be down that much in niw because that would actually free up a lot of capital i would think j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes those are the actual results we haven t disclosed anything about our future plans for niw randy binner b riley fbr analyst oh i m sorry i thought you said around 50 billion richard thornberry chief executive officer this is rick we did we said it would be around 50 billion for 2019 i think as we said last year as well and by the way when you think about capital requirements in this business it s really the growth in the insurance in force portfolio year over year so current niw at that level would result in a growth in our portfolio but we given the capital we generate every quarter we do believe that we are very capital strong company now both in terms of existing capital structure as frank mentioned that pmiers really looking at the operating company but when you look at the combined capital strength across on a consolidated basis with the capital we have at holdco as well this is a very strong well capitalized entity with a lot of financial flexibility and so yes even with the assumption that we will do around 50 billion next year we ll see growth in the insurance in force portfolio and apply capital accordingly randy binner b riley fbr analyst okay thank you operator we have a question from mark devries with barclays mark devries barclays analyst frank you may have pre empted me a little bit with some of your prepared comments i m going to ask about capital returns anyway i understand you re not going to be specific could you just talk about how you re thinking about your options for capital returns at the linked company and how you would prioritize this year and then finally kind of is there a minimum cash balance that you would want to maintain at the holding company j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes a great question thanks mark yes so put it in the broad context again of just capital planning overall and you think about the conversations that we re having among the management team and our board of directors the full range of options get discussed and but primarily what we re looking to do is make sure that we have sufficient capital to support the business and our expected growth overall and then as we think about the capital flexibility that could be derived from further risk distribution further upstream of capital from the operating company to the holding company and we think about targeted leverage ratios and things of that nature and the full range of options get discussed and i think what you ve seen from us historically is that we re opportunistic about returns of capital to shareholders traditionally we ve done it through share buybacks but again as we re looking at the capital plan we are in a great position of strength and so that does allow us to contemplate a broader range but again all of those things are being looked at and contemplated but in the context of the overall capital plan mark devries barclays analyst okay understood and then just i know you re not going to be more specific about what options you re going to address now but when you think about buybacks is the stock an evaluation here where it looks attractive to you guys in terms of being kind of at or below intrinsic value j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes that s a great question and i would just point you to how we ve managed our share repurchases historically and we certainly can t peg a price and say that that s what we re managing to but our share repurchase program historically have been value based in nature and we see that view around share repurchases likely to continue but you hit the nail on the head on value relative to intrinsic value is one of the metrics that we look at certainly book value as well so without pegging it to a number i would just broadly categorize it as value based mark devries barclays analyst okay and then just finally a follow up on your comments around the pmiers cushion it sounds like you feel comfortable with that 12 15 range here does that imply that if you sell the cycle start to look a little bit more concerning to you that you probably flex that cushion up if you re a little bit more concerned about kind of the forward outlook for the business j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer well certainly that part of the purpose of having the cushion is to deal with the volatility associated with potential for economic downturn i would tell you that we contemplate some level of that as we do our capital planning overall and i would also just caution around pegging to 10 to 15 cushion i would say ordinary course that that s a comfortable level but to your point if circumstances change we would manage it in a current context richard thornberry chief executive officer and i think mark to frank s point when you look at the overall capital strength of the business between opco between radian guaranty and radian group you ve got a significant amount of capital financial flexibility and we have the ability to look at it holistically and be very thoughtful about how we allocate capital to future uses and i think the other part of it is as frank and i ve talked about in previous quarters one of the great things about having a strong insurance in force portfolio provides a significant strength capital flexibility as a source of capital as well so we ve distributed very little of our risk in force and i think it continues to provide us a tremendous amount of flexibility around capital mark devries barclays analyst okay got it thank you operator we have a question from bose george with kbw please go ahead bose george kbw analyst so just following up on this capital in terms of future use of the iln market is that likely to be if you do it is that likely to be on 2018 and future production is there any reason to do anything with the older books and also just given your excess capital position how does that play into your position to use many more iln j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer thanks bose for that question i think i would just broadly describe it i think rick has said this in the past as well we are in a very fortunate position to not have a need to do anything in the insurance linked note market our capital position is very strong and it s sufficient to support our organic growth going forward so you think about how we utilized ilns on a go forward basis it really is with an eye toward shaping the portfolio from a risk management standpoint and optimizing into that regard so as it pertains to any particular vintage or any particular portfolio we re careful to evaluate that in a context of what s right for us from a risk management standpoint so i would want to just come out and say on a wholesale basis it will look like this on a repeated basis we re going to look for the opportunities to do what s right for our portfolio primarily from a risk management context bose george kbw analyst okay it makes sense thanks and then actually just switching to the iln expense can you remind us when that sort of when it started hitting the p l this quarter and the full impact of that going forward just in basis points j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer sure so we first took the charge excuse me took the expense into the run rate in november and it s roughly 0 5 basis point bose george kbw analyst and the 0 5 basis point was the impact just for this quarter you mean j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer that s an annualized number bose george kbw analyst that s an annualized number okay perfect thank you operator we have a question from doug harter with credit suisse please go ahead douglas harter credit suisse analyst can you talk about what your target debt to capital ratio might be longer term and how you would think about kind of your maturities beyond the 2019 j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer sure so what we have said historically is that our debt to capital ratio is due to a couple of lens it s really in our overall capital planning but also with an eye toward rating agencies we ve said historically that we would like to return to investment grade and so we think it s important to have a capital structure that would support that conclusion from the rating agencies so as you think about our debt maturities we ve got the june 2019 coming up which is about 159 million the next after that is the june 2020 of 234 million i would say that we are again just viewing all of those things through a much much broader lens of overall capital planning but the debt to capital in particular is one that we think operating in the low 20s is an appropriate place to support a rating agency view of investment grade and should they choose to do so douglas harter credit suisse analyst great thank you operator we have a question from phil stefano with deutsche bank please go ahead phil stefano deutsche bank analyst going back to the i think it was the mid august announcement that there was a repurchase authorization i was under the impression there was going to be 10b 5 program in place and i guess i m a little surprised that the stock wasn t at the value that the 10b 5 would have had you actively repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter and i was hoping you could talk around that was there a 10b 5 in place j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer great question phil the way that i would characterize the and you re correct there was a share repurchase authorization in place has been since i believe june of the prior year when we were going through and looking at the capital plan and again all of these capital related levers that we re speaking to are always viewed in the context of the overall capital plan and so the landscape throughout the last half of the year was viewed through the lens of pmiers 2 0 it was viewed through the lens of issuing our first iln and xol structure it was viewed through the lens of the dividend or excuse me the return of capital that we requested of pa and so as we look through all of those options and opportunities it was i would say sufficient capital activities that we felt comfortable landing where we did and you ll also noticed and nobody has asked this just yet but the surplus note that we had in place at the end of last year also remains in place at the end of this year and so as we think about the things that we re managing toward for year end 2018 we felt that what we accomplished in the fourth quarter was appropriate for our capital structure phil stefano deutsche bank analyst no i agree i guess my thought was always that the 10b 5 program operated on its own and when the stock was of a evaluation that the 10b 5 program prescribed you d be buying back shares j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes so that is certainly one option that we have to utilize the share repurchase program i won t comment on the specifics around how we ve utilized it thus far you are correct in your statement but that is that s only one way to manage your share repurchase program phil stefano deutsche bank analyst got it understood ok and then switching gears i was hoping to talk about radar rates how many pricing inputs are you currently utilizing and do you have a number of metrics in mind where it hits the tipping point that you ve kind of hit scale derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services this is derek so i m not going to get into exactly how many pricing imports we utilized i consider that kind of proprietary information the way to look at it and the way we look at the pricing input is kind of utilizing our proprietary modeling we have a lot of the inputs back and we use for kind of its predictive power so when we re kind of determining what we re going to use for pricing it s really balancing what variables are going to predict loan performance also factoring in the operational complexity for our customers to actually utilize those in pricing and then also taking into account the competitive landscape so with respect to that we have an ability to add or kind of subtract variables i would say this in terms of number of variables in terms of unique rates you come up with the variables currently in the system it will be over a million different rates that you can kind of come up with the various combinations phil stefano deutsche bank analyst got it okay thanks guys best of luck operator we have a question from jack micenko with sig please go ahead jack micenko sig analyst i guess first question looking at some of the it looks like some share shift in the fourth quarter and then rick your guide on the 50 of niw down pretty significantly is there anything that you re doing or pulling away from business wise that maybe is driving some of that richard thornberry chief executive officer so just in terms of the 50 just and by the way thank you for the question jack i think in terms of the 50 just keep in mind that s exactly what we said last year as well and i think we certainly over performed or outperformed that number i think as we look at the market today and i think as we ve said for the past several quarters we are less focused on market share and more focused on building economic value and the construction of our portfolio for long term returns for our shareholders and so as we think about the business today and as we have for the last few years we re focused on doing business with the customers that we believe do business in the right way and with both originate and service in the right way so i think as brien mcmahon likes to say often we fight for every niw policy that fits our profile and i think as you see the market shifting today it s really evolving to our strength but we have to be mindful that we re in the business of value creation not market share and not i ve been in the mortgage industry for a long long time and i ve never seen anybody went on market share you went on focused on value i think value creation thinking very thoughtfully about where you do business profitably versus just do business and so our approach and derek and i and frank and the rest of the team we are very very focused on making sure that the business we do is of high quality at the right risk adjusted returns and that we re doing business with the customers that originate and service loans in a quality way so i think what differentiates us in the market is really how analytical we are about our approach to the business so things like risk based pricing granular pricing play to our strength given our proprietary analytics but we go beyond that is to really we use of analytics to determine who the right customers are what the how do we help them become more profitable more effective through our relationship with them whose services are risk because remember one of the great first things i learned when i got to this business is other people service our risk every day so whose services are risk well how does it all play together from an long term sustainable value point of view so from our guidance that we gave this morning i would not read anything into that in terms of kind of year over year kind of market share thoughts but what i would want you to hear is that our focuses has not been and won t be as long as i m here and i think the rest of the team is on market share purely but i think our sales team and the relationships we have in the marketplace working with our great customers i think we re able to grow a very valuable and profitable business here and we couldn t do it without the team in the field working with our customers and the customers value working with us so i feel very good about where we re at feel very good about how we re playing approaching the market and quite frankly i think the market changes play to our strength and being well capitalized very analytical great customer relationships delivering great service is the winning combination jack micenko sig analyst alright great and then i guess one for frank how do we think about expense the operating expense line in 2019 i guess my question is does radian leverage in 2019 on the expense ratio versus 2018 and aside to that the 4 million correct me if i m wrong the 4 million of deal expenses that was in operating why isn t that in the services expense line or am i confusing the multiple speakers j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer it is yes when you yes it is it is in services and it is in our yes it is in our operating expense line on a consolidated richard thornberry chief executive officer but it doesn t reflect deal expenses ongoing operating expenses of the acquired entities j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer that s correct and so just broadly and great question on expenses the way that we have evolved our analysis and management of expenses is to look at it on an operating leverage basis and you ve heard me say for years now that positive operating leverage is our objective which simply means our revenues are growing at a faster rate than our expenses are so while we certainly pay attention to the absolute level of expenses as we start to bring in different types of businesses as well we think that s the right metric to use for the management of that and so if you look at the full year of 2018 we had revenue growth of 8 we had expense growth of 1 so that creates positive operating leverage of 7 and that is a very strong number and so as we look for ways to lever the business as you say that s what we re looking toward jack micenko sig analyst and is it safe to assume that that trend should continue or at least that s your goal j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes so as we would expect the positive operating leverage to continue now i will tell you that it s a relatively sensitive metric to expenses and depending upon whether we re bringing in new businesses investing in them or acquiring new businesses whose financial performance has not yet been optimized that could change slightly but we ll be sure to call out those items when they occur operator we have a question from chris gamaitoni with compass point please go ahead chris gamaitoni compass point analyst most of my questions have been answered i guess just a final follow up is this question was asked but i don t think we got a clear answer how do you view holding co cash requirements is this some type of run rate or holdco expenses or just how do we envision on a long term basis how you view what how much capital you need at the holdco j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer great question this is frank again i ll bring it back to the overall capital planning that we do we view it as certainly a place where we have the most financial flexibility and we would expect to manage that at the appropriate level given what our future plans and expectations are in the context of that long range capital plan it s available truly for anything but on a near term basis certainly 159 million of the upcoming 2019 maturities the other thing that we look to as well as our credit facility which is available to us and so when we look at that combination there i think we ve managed it very well over time and we have continued to build strength in the combination of the hard cash if you will in that credit facility and that credit facility really is also a testament to the enhanced financial strength that radian has achieved over the past several years and so to peg it to a hard number or a multiple of anything and some companies do that as far as interest coverage or years of interest expense radian is also in a very fortunate position to have an interest and tax sharing arrangement where through an agreement that we have in place with our subsidiary we don t need to request special dividends or returns of capital to deal with the operating expenses and the interest expense associated with that debt so as you look at again back to financial flexibility we really have achieved a tremendous amount of financial flexibility to deal with any of the burdens both known and potentially unknown that we didn t encounter so again hopefully that s helpful chris gamaitoni compass point analyst and one probably for derek how do we think about reserve adequacy at this point maybe just like where default to claim rates are relative to historical basis obviously there has been reserve releases over time but just like any perspective on if there is still room to go down versus what call it a normalized level would be derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services well you are not going to be surprised in terms of where we think we are from a reserve perspective we think we re appropriately reserved so that s kind of an easy one but in terms of looking at it kind of historically and you look at those roll ph rates on new defaults those are getting at pretty low levels i think the lowest we ve seen them historically on kind of the new defaults is ultimate roll ph to claim rate of about 8 so we re kind of down to those levels so obviously if you continue to see positive economic development home price appreciation you could potentially see continued positive development but i m not going to really speculate in terms of how much we positive development we would have embedded if any operator we have a question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst really quickly just in your premium yields i was looking at slide 10 the in force premium yield it s been trending higher for the last couple of quarters which is i think a little surprising given concerns around pricing and the fact that you put in new pricing last year and i was just wondering what is driving that is it mix or something else j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes that is a great question this is frank as you look at the change i think what you ll pick up on and you obviously have there is an uptick but it s due primarily to a little bit of mix shift a little bit of seasonality and there was just a very small accounting adjustment in there so you add up the combined impact of those three it looks like a trend and i wouldn t read too much into it though mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then with the new pricing and will ph that you put in place how does that pricing compare to the old pricing so like lets say if it s go all your business was running on that in q4 what would that have looked like any chance you d alter that derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services this is derek so the one thing we look at it really from a return perspective so in terms of the exact pricing and the way that filters through that s going to depend upon your particular mix of business so when we ve rolled it out i would say the response has been very positive so we ve had as rick indicated we ve indicated in the past once we are ready to go it would be pretty seamless and that s what we found so we found significant transition lenders moving in which is a positive and so far as it allows us to more dynamically and effectively manage the risk mix of our portfolio the risk return profile and ultimately optimize the economic value so when we re looking at it i wouldn t just look at kind of premiums overall it s really how that translates depending upon the variables we use to price into a return and from that perspective we haven t changed our return target for the business overall mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and just so i understand how dynamic is it in the sense how often do you or can you go in and change the pricing whether you see something that you don t like or something that looks particularly attractive or you see as an opportunity is it a lot more dynamic now derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services very dynamic so and i would say we will change pricing as often as we need to and buyout often as we need to it s really balancing all those things in terms of customer right what they need what they can deliver and also what we need to do in order to maximize the risk return profile of the business coming in so to the extent we see mix shifts that we re not comfortable with or seeing kind of product shifts that could be driven by consumers in the market it could be driven by competitors our ability to switch that pricing and do it frequently is very dynamic we can do that kind of as often as we need to richard thornberry chief executive officer i would just add to derek s point because i think this is a really important point for everyone which is the analytic framework we have in our business enables us to do that on a real time basis so it s a combination of kind of the technology and the connectivity we have with our customers to deliver the price and the analytics that we have supporting it again i go back to my comment earlier this whole change i believe plays to our strength and when you re driven by market share and volume on one end versus one who is focused and is long term focused on delivering the economic value this is a great time to be in the mortgage insurance industry with the tools that we have mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you for that one last question on claims paid the number i think was 37 ish million this quarter is down and i understand that the volume of claims paid is going down too but even adjusting for that if i look at it over the couple of years it feels like it s been trending lower and i was wondering is there something that s driving that i mean the reason why it would keep going lower or higher going forward derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services you are talking about the aggregate claims paid number mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes whether it s the aggregate or even on a per paid basis if you well derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services alright yes so some of that s going to be driven by couple of factors one just our default inventory is decreasing right year over year so your aggregate number is going to go down and when you look at it on a per claims basis a lot of that is going to be driven by kind of the geographies that are kind of coming through as claims right so to the extent you have relatively higher concentrations and higher balanced states like california that s going to affect your claims paid number as well so it s really a combination the aggregate size of your default inventory and then i would say that distribution within it in terms of how long they ve been in default and kind of the geographic location of those outstanding defaults it s really going to be those factors and as a result of those things you can have some movement up and down kind of quarter to quarter mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay but there is no reason why the trend should be lower or something like that just looking out to the next year or two claims for default again claims for default not on aggregate i get the aggregate point i m just saying even if i just bake the total claims paid divided by the number of claim number of claims paid you see that number is trending low derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services i would say that in terms of the trend on a per loan basis no i don t see a reason to think of it going particularly one direction or another you can just see kind of volatility around that number over time mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great thank you thanks for taking my questions operator our last question today comes from the line of geoffrey dunn with dowling and partners please go ahead geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst frank was there any iln cost in the premium line this quarter and what is the expectation on a quarterly run rate for call it first half of next year j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes so the cost is amortized over the expected life of the iln and i mentioned earlier the ongoing cost associated with the iln is about 0 5 basis point geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst what s it sort of dollars j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes whatever the math on that we re got to be i can find it for you geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst i guess specifically for the quarter how much hit or did any hit j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer for the quarter it started in november so we get two out of three months 2 3 million geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst great thank you operator mr dunn did you have any additional questions geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst i do

refer to non gaap financial measures for discussion of these measures net income represents net income attributable to coty inc reconciliations from reported to adjusted results can be found at the end of this release overview revenues 2q19 reported net revenues of 2 511 2 million decreased 4 8 with a like for like lfl revenue growth of 0 7 the strong sequential improvement in both the reported and lfl performance reflected the combination of several temporary factors including i burberry entering the lfl revenue base and facing a depressed prior year comparable ii the positive impact from changes in revenue recognition policy iii the shift of luxury shipments from 1q19 into 2q19 as a result of the u s hurricane florence and iv some moderation in the supply chain related headwinds discussed in 1q19 we estimate these factors cumulatively benefited our lfl revenue growth rate by approximately 2 implying a moderate underlying 2q19 lfl decline this performance reflects strong lfl growth in luxury underlying growth in professional beauty and a high single digit decline in consumer beauty year to date reported net revenues of 4 542 5 million decreased by 6 8 with a lfl revenue decline of 3 2 we estimate that the underlying lfl net revenue trend was a decline of approximately 2 in 1h19 excluding the temporary factors above gross margin 2q19 reported gross margin of 61 9 increased by 80 bps from the prior year period while the adjusted gross margin of 62 1 increased by 50 bps primarily driven by the divisional revenue mix shift toward luxury and professional beauty improvement in the professional beauty gross margin due to product mix and the margin benefit from favorable fx year to date reported gross margin of 61 1 was flat with the prior year while the adjusted gross margin of 61 3 decreased by 20 bps fueled by the gross margin contraction in 1q19 connected to supply chain disruptions operating income 2q19 reported operating loss of 804 6 million compared to 2q18 reported operating income of 175 2 million reflecting a 965 1 million non cash impairment charge primarily connected to the consumer beauty division and select brand trademarks 2q19 adjusted operating income of 322 3 million declined by 7 from the prior year with an adjusted operating margin of 12 8 the year over year decline in adjusted operating income reflected the contraction in net revenues a cp increasing as a percentage of net revenues during the quarter and foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 4 this was partially offset by strong fixed cost reduction 2q19 adjusted operating income was also impacted by the temporary factors cited above including i the supply chain headwinds ii the timing of luxury shipments iii revenue recognition and iv the net impact of m a as the incremental burberry contribution was partially offset by the lost profit from the fy18 brand rationalization program the cumulative negative impact from these factors in 2q19 was approximately 2m which implies a high single digit decline in underlying adjusted operating income in the quarter year to date reported operating loss of 825 3 million compared to reported operating income of 204 7 million in the prior year year to date adjusted operating income of 463 1 million declined by 15 from the prior year with a margin of 10 2 in 1h19 we estimate that adjusted operating income was adversely impacted by temporary factors of approximately 48 million including over 90 million from the supply chain disruptions excluding these temporary impacts the 1h19 underlying adjusted operating income would have declined approximately 6 year over year with an operating margin of approximately 11 net income 2q19 reported net loss of 960 6 million compared to reported net income of 109 2 million in the prior year while the adjusted net income of 181 9 million declined 23 driven by the lower adjusted operating income and the 41 8 million positive foreign tax settlement in the prior year period year to date reported net loss of 972 7 million compared to reported net income of 89 5 million in the prior year while the adjusted net income of 262 4 million decreased 16 earnings per share eps 2q19 reported earnings per share of 1 28 declined from 0 15 in the prior year and the adjusted eps of 0 24 declined from 0 32 in the prior year the year over year decline in reported eps reflects the significant 965 1 million impairment charge discussed above while the decline in the adjusted eps is driven by the aforementioned tax benefit in 2q18 which contributed 0 05 to eps year to date reported earnings per share of 1 30 declined from 0 12 in the prior year and the adjusted eps of 0 35 declined from 0 42 in the prior year operating cash flow net debt in 2q19 net cash provided by operating activities was 319 6 million broadly in line with 2q18 as we drove strong conversion of operating income into operating cash flow supported by working capital improvement first half operating cash flow totaled 237 7 million down 70 1 million from the same period of the prior year our 2q19 free cash flow of 193 9 million was largely in line with 2q18 and reflected the strong operating cash flow result and a moderate year over year decline in capex first half free cash flow of 21 6 million decreased from 75 6 million in the prior year driven by weakness in 1q19 net debt of 7 488 5 million on december 31 2018 decreased by 172 8 million from the balance of 7 661 3 million on september 30 2018 driven by positive free cash flow and a benefit from foreign exchange this resulted in a last twelve months net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 5 8x consistent with the reported ratio on september 30 2018 management comments commenting on the financial results pierre laubies coty ceo said since i joined the company a few months ago i have been thoroughly evaluating each part of our business working to assess what has and has not worked and where the opportunities lie within coty there are clear opportunities to improve how we run our company in order to enhance the quality of our business model thereby giving us the time that we need to address our more strategic issues i must stress that while we are confident that we can return coty to a path of sustainable growth we are also realistic that it will take time to achieve this outcome our luxury and professional beauty divisions are growing reasonably well but they cannot compensate completely for the difficult trajectory of our consumer beauty division in consumer beauty we need to earn our right to grow from a financial standpoint gross margin improvement will become our key area of focus gross margin is the lifeblood of the business and we recognize that we must close the gap we have here versus our beauty peers that means managing revenue and costs improving product mix and range simplifying our portfolio and formulations and systemically deploying lean inspired methodologies in our manufacturing and logistics operations while we will deploy these principles whenever possible in the remainder of fy19 our immediate objective is to finalize a strategic plan which will define our agenda for the medium term i look forward to sharing more details on this plan in the coming months i have a great deal of confidence that the management team we have put into place is the right one to develop this plan and that together with the broader coty organization we will be able to meet the objectives of driving gross margin improvement and sustained topline growth outlook as we focus on building a healthier business model we anticipate a profit trend recovery in the second half of fy19 we expect that fy19 constant currency adjusted operating income will be moderately below

4 9 0 15 4 in 2q19 reported luxury net revenues of 1 017 5 million increased by 7 0 versus the prior year on a lfl basis luxury net revenues increased by 10 8 primarily driven by the addition of burberry to the lfl base and solid growth of the core portfolio despite ongoing impact from the supply chain disruption we estimate that the luxury division delivered mid single digit growth in 2q19 and 1h19 after adjusting for the supply chain disruptions and excluding the impact of burberry 2q19 sell out was strong across our top brands with particularly good performances by gucci marc jacobs and burberry net revenue growth was driven by calvin klein gucci marc jacobs and chloe tiffany s sell out performance remained strong during the holiday period despite lapping the brand s launch in the prior year hugo boss revenues in 2q19 declined as the brand was impacted by the supply chain disruptions the luxury division delivered reported operating income of 113 6 million an increase of 33 vs the prior year period 2q19 adjusted operating income was 176 9 million reflecting very strong 41 growth from the prior year driven by the reported net revenue growth and solid fixed cost reductions

consumer beauty net revenues of 967 8 million declined 15 0 on a reported basis and declined 7 3 lfl we estimate that the net impact of the supply chain disruptions was offset by the positive impact in 2q19 from a required revenue recognition policy change implying a high single digit underlying lfl decline in both 2q19 and 1h19 this performance was broadly in line with sell out trends as our brands were pressured by continued weakness in the mass beauty market particularly in the u s and europe although we saw some moderation in the pace of our market share losses the consumer beauty division continues to be affected by the indirect impacts of the supply chain disruptions including customer penalties and increased promotions which reduced net revenues by category net revenue in color cosmetics declined mid single digits and retail hair declined high single digits while covergirl and clairol net revenues benefited from a favorable comparable due to the inventory depletion in the prior year ahead of the 3q18 brand relaunches sell through continued to decline high single digits in 2q19 our u s brands experienced moderating market share losses in traditional retailers share gains on amazon and improving innovation performance sally hansen reported strong growth in the quarter supported by innovation the wella retail brand continued to gain share with strength in styling in developed markets and hair color in emerging markets in brazil our local brands continue to drive strong revenue growth and market share gains during 2q19 younique revenues and profit remained pressured due to a decline in product sales and presenter sponsorship as we continue to refine our product offerings and compensation plan structure to drive improvements in presenter sales activity recruitment and retention our loyalty and subscription programs gained traction in the quarter driving growth in customer revenues although weakness in active presenters more than offset this growth in 3q19 younique launched a customizable skincare line you ology reported operating loss in 2q19 of 906 9 million compared to reported operating income of 99 3 million in the prior year period reflecting non cash impairment charges of 832 5 million to the consumer beauty goodwill and 97 8 million to the trademarks of covergirl clairol and two small regional brands the consumer beauty division has experienced increased competitive and market pressure throughout the first half of fiscal 2019 which has resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings additionally the discount rate used in the impairment review associated with the division has also increased in the quarter based on these adverse factors management determined that there were indications that the goodwill of the division as well as certain trademark intangible assets may be impaired and accordingly interim intangible asset and goodwill impairment tests were performed as of december 31 2018 the 2q19 adjusted operating income of 54 1 million declined from 131 9 million in the prior year period resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 5 6 despite reductions in fixed costs the adjusted operating margin was pressured by net revenue contraction and gross margin pressure linked to the supply chain disruptions professional beauty three months ended december 31 2018 six months ended december 31

be viewed as historical data non gaap financial measures the company operates on a global basis with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the u s accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations therefore to supplement financial results presented in accordance with gaap certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations constant currency constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period with the current period s results calculated at the prior year period s rates the company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than u s dollars into u s dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates the constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate the constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the company discloses the following constant currency financial measures net revenues organic like for like lfl net revenues adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income the company presents period over period comparisons of net revenues on a constant currency basis as well as on an organic lfl basis the company believes that organic lfl better enables management and investors to analyze and compare the company s net revenues performance from period to period for the period described in this release the term like for like describes the company s core operating performance excluding the financial impact of i acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results ii divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands in the prior year period to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period and iii foreign currency exchange translations to the extent applicable for a reconciliation of organic

margin effective tax rate net income net income margin net revenues and eps diluted on a non gaap basis and specifies that these measures are non gaap by using the term adjusted the company believes these non gaap financial measures better enable management and investors to analyze and compare operating performance from period to period in calculating adjusted operating income operating income margin gross profit gross margin effective tax rate net income net income margin and eps diluted the company excludes the following items costs related to acquisition activities the company excludes acquisition related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction the nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired also the size complexity and or volume of past acquisitions which often drives the magnitude of such expenses may not be indicative of the size complexity and or volume of any future acquisitions restructuring and other business realignment costs the company excludes costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward looking guidance in addition the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs by excluding the above referenced expenses from the non gaap financial measures management is able to evaluate the company s ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long term value furthermore management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the gaap information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the company s operating performance asset impairment charges we have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and or size of acquisitions our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the gaap information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance amortization expense the company excludes the impact of amortization of finite lived intangible assets as such non cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and or size of acquisitions management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the gaap information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the company s operating performance although the company excludes amortization of intangible assets from the non gaap expenses management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets interest and other income expense the company excludes foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition related and debt financing related forward contracts as well as debt financing transaction costs as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions loss on early extinguishment of debt we have excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a non cash charge and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions noncontrolling interest this adjustment represents the after tax impact of the non gaap adjustments included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non controlling interest percentage tax this adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from adjusted net income the tax impact of the non gaap adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred the estimated supply chain impact to adjusted operating income only includes the direct impact on net revenues and the associated impact on cost of sales while the company assumed no impact from any other operating expenses the company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non gaap financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with gaap for a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit adjusted eps diluted to eps diluted and adjusted net revenues to net revenues see the table entitled reconciliation

table entitled reconciliation of reported net income to adjusted net income the company also presents free cash flow adjusted ebitda and net debt management believes that these measures are useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures adjusted ebitda is defined as adjusted operating income less depreciation and net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents for a reconciliation of free cash flow see the table entitled reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for adjusted ebitda see the table entitled reconciliation of adjusted operating income to adjusted ebitda and for net debt see the table entitled reconciliation of total debt to net debt these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap to the extent that the company provides guidance it does so only on a non gaap basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward looking non gaap measures to gaap due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation including adjustments that could be made for restructuring integration and acquisition related expenses amortization expenses

and outlook following our prepared remarks we will open the lines for questions 2018 was another year of strong top line growth in earnings acceleration for century leading to our 16th consecutive year of profitability for the year we increased revenues 51 to 2 1 billion grew our deliveries 68 to 6 099 homes increased our net new contracts 48 to 5 657 homes continued the expansion of our national footprint into additional attractive markets with the purchase of wade jurney homes increased adjusted ebitda to 228 million and increased adjusted net income to a record 120 million or 3 94 per share assuming we had owned 100 of wade jurney homes for all of 2018 we would have delivered 7 092 homes for the full year and homebuilding revenues would have been 2 3 billion despite a strong overall year for century our fourth quarter home deliveries and net new contracts were impacted by buyer hesitation to increased interest rates and tightening affordability which has resulted in an industry wide softening of homebuilding activity in the second half of 2018 however we remain confident in long term housing fundamentals given underlying job and population growth along with overall positive economic conditions despite the slower buyer activity we generated solid growth in our key operating metrics during the fourth quarter including home sales revenue up 24 and sg a percentage improvement of 80 basis points our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin performance of 20 4 was in line with our expectations and for the full year we achieved an adjusted homebuilding gross margin of 21 6 which improved by 20 basis points compared to 2017 this resulted in adjusted homebuilding gross profit dollars up 51 for the year we were especially pleased with this full year accomplishment in light of higher construction costs which continue to impact the industry we ended the fourth quarter up 65 in backlog to nearly 2 200 homes equating to 670 million in backlog value an increase of 17 compared to 573 million in the prior year quarter this significant increase in backlog homes and value puts us in a good position for 2019 we were pleased with the 2018 performance of our financial services group which provides mortgage title services and insurance to create a one stop solution for century s homebuyers this business tripled its revenue to 31 7 million and delivered over 6 times year over year growth in pre tax income to 8 8 million representing an attractive margin of approximately 28 we have actively been providing our financial service offerings to our existing century communities buyers and have now expanded these offerings to include the wade jurney homes buyers we expect our financial services group will continue to produce substantial growth at attractive margins and meaningful profits in its ongoing expansion we remain confident in the strength and stability of our business given that our national footprint is diverse and comprised of attractive markets with strong economic fundamentals we have a high concentration of homes at affordable price points which we began investing in several years ago we have a strong track record with experienced cycle tested corporate regional and divisional management teams along with our proven ability to source land control cost and strategically deploy capital into sound investments during 2019 we will continue to carefully monitor the homebuilding climate in each of our markets and pursue our disciplined growth strategy while taking advantage of our diversified national scale to achieve additional improvements in our business i d now like to turn the call over to rob to discuss our markets and business in greater detail robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director thank you dale and good afternoon everyone in 2018 we grew century into a top 10 homebuilder through strategic positioning and attractive markets with a higher mix of home deliveries at lower price points our acquisition of wade jurney homes was a significant catalyst to that end overall net new home contracts were up 48 year over year with organic growth accounting for 22 and we ended the quarter at 122 active century communities branded selling communities across our markets we are seeing employment gains which is a positive data point for local economic growth additionally the average month supply across all of our markets is approximately 2 5 months these economic indicators remain supportive of long term growth throughout our national footprint however homebuyer demand may vary well remain muted in the near term due to a variety of macro factors including an adjustment period where buyers are adapting to higher mortgage rates and tightening affordability in regard to the specifics of our regions and starting with our mountain region our home sales revenues and deliveries increased 23 and 16 respectively year over year in the fourth quarter new home prices have remained steady throughout the region despite adverse impacts of affordability denver s economy remains strong and the city has the second fastest growing millennial population in the nation high growth companies in affordably priced housing of drawn new employees to salt lake city las vegas is ranked fourth in the country with population growth and sixth in wage growth supporting a robust sales environment for many homes priced under 350 000 where we are also seeing strong traction this market strength led to a 30 increase in deliveries for our las vegas division our texas regions operations have improved substantially as we continue to strategically gear our products toward more affordable price points while improving margins fourth quarter new home contracts in this region improved 38 year over year while deliveries increased by 34 the demand for entry level product remains healthy throughout our texas region where we have transitioned lower price points which have improved overall velocity and margins our west region has been the most impacted by softening market conditions and tightening affordability specifically the san francisco bay area and southern california while inland areas has held have held up relatively well our west regions product offerings and communities target lower price points in their market and our planned opening of six communities in the first quarter of 2019 will improve our positioning to capture demand in this region in the southeast region home sales revenues and backlog dollar value for the fourth quarter increased by 9 and 25 year over year respectively the job growth outlook in charlotte is promising where several large corporations are currently planning to move their headquarters in atlanta and nashville demand fundamentals are steady despite weaker affordability trends that have impacted new home sales in certain areas tech workers continue to fill the city in atlanta with the city s tech village posting over 300 start ups which we view as a positive for longer term growth since completion of the wade jurney homes acquisition in june of 2018 we have invested capital and other resources into the asset light entry level business line to enable and support the significant growth that we expect these initiatives include the following the addition of experienced management personnel dedicated to this business source from both outside century as well as transfers of people from within century implementation of enhanced systems processes and procedures including the start of the back office conversion which we anticipate will be largely completed by the end of the second quarter expansion beyond the southeast and into alabama texas arizona indiana and ohio where we continue to expect these markets to generate closings in the first quarter of 2019 we have also made a change to the sales approach for wade jurney homes whereby we are now selling homes later in the construction cycle homes are no longer being marketed prior to the start of construction while this shift will impact near term sales volume we do not anticipate that it will materially impact the timing of closings in the spec based business model as evidenced by year end finished unsold homes being less than 3 of the region s total homes under construction for the 6 5 months of 2018 that we fully owned the business wade jurney homes delivered 1 377 homes for 210 million of revenue and generated 20 800 000 of pre tax profits excluding purchase price accounting considering our national portfolio and despite challenging market conditions that continued into the fourth quarter of the year we are pleased with the progress we made during 2018 including our increased entry level exposure and dedication to improving the efficiency of our operations nationwide strong local economies have assisted in mitigating softer market conditions such as healthy household formations strong jobs and strong population numbers we have increased our offering of incentives consistent with our expectations and we ll continue to do so as necessary in markets where it makes sense as of year end we had approximately 38 000 owned and controlled lots that position us well through 2020 into 2019 we will continue to focus on streamlining and creating even more efficient operations throughout our geographically diverse platform maintaining consistent strength in our balance sheet sourcing accretive investments and expanding wade jurney homes in the carefully selected areas i will now turn the call over to dave who will provide greater detail on our financial results and outlook david l messenger chief financial officer thank you rob in the fourth quarter of 2018 we continue to improve our revenues and made improvements across our key operating metrics our adjusted net income grew to 34 4 million or 1 11 per diluted share compared to 1 01 per diluted share in the prior year quarter our full year adjusted net income was 119 9 million or 3 94 per share an increase of 69 compared to 71 1 million or 2 87 per share in the prior year net income for the quarter increased to 26 2 million or 0 85 per share and net income for the full year nearly doubled to 96 5 million or 3 17 per share ebitda in the fourth quarter increased by 13 to 54 4 million and 53 to 189 3 million for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 grew 10 to 64 2 million compared to 58 6 million in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda for the full year was 227 9 million up 51 compared to 150 5 million in 2017 gross margin for the fourth quarter was 16 5 as a result of purchase price accounting adjustments the use of incentives and the cost inflation trends during the first three quarters of 2018 when these homes were contracted adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 20 4 compared to 21 7 in the prior year quarter for the full year homebuilding gross margin was 17 5 compared to 17 9 in 2017 and full year 2018 adjusted homebuilding gross margin increased 20 basis points to 21 6 compared to 21 4 in the full year 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred 9 7 million of purchase accounting charges pertaining primarily to the wade jurney homes acquisition in the first quarter of 2019 we expect to incur the remaining 2 million of purchase price accounting adjustments related to the wade jurney homes acquisition sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues improved to a 11 4 in the fourth quarter compared to 12 1 in the prior year quarter the 80 basis point improvement was primarily due to process enhancements and overall disciplined cost controls and scale benefits derived from our homebuilding platform reducing our sg a as a percent of homebuilding revenues will remain one of our primary focus items in 2019 during 2018 we made significant progress in expanding our financial services subsidiary which consists of mortgage title services and insurance in the fourth quarter of 2018 the business contributed 3 3 million in pre tax income with 10 4 million of revenue compared to 1 1 million of pre tax income on 5 2 million of revenue in the prior year quarter for the full year financial services pre tax income increased 8 8 million compared to 1 2 million in 2017 now turning to our balance sheet and liquidity during the fourth quarter of 2018 we initiated a 4 5 million share repurchase program and we repurchased approximately 687 000 shares at a weighted average price of 17 99 per share as of december 31 2018 we had total debt of 1 1 billion with total liquidity of 445 million including 57 million of cash and 388 million of availability on our unsecured revolver with 859 million of stockholders equity our net homebuilding debt to net capital ratio stood at 52 at december 31 marking a 170 basis point improvement from 53 7 at the end of the third quarter as dale and rob mentioned we have a solid balance sheet with 38 000 lots spread across a diverse national portfolio with a focus on lower price point homes we have invested in markets that still exhibit positive long term fundamentals however due to the limited near term visibility in the overall housing market we will not be providing full year guidance until we see meaningful unpredictable demand trends we would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work during 2018 as we look forward to delivering quality homes to our customers while driving additional value for all of our stakeholders in the quarters and years to come operator please open the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting the question and answer session operator instructions our first question is from the line of jay mccanless with wedbush please proceed with your question jay your line is live you may proceed jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst sorry about that can you guys talk about january what you saw from order trends and traffic and how has how incentives trended since the end of 2018 dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman sure jay this is dale as we approached q4 last year we instituted additional incentives on specs that were scheduled to complete in the last quarter of the year as we near the end of this november we began reducing those incentives what we experienced was an increase in year over year sales in both october and november but with the reduced incentives december sales declined year over year this trend continued into january however toward the end of january and so far in february we ve really seen increased traffic in sales and so when we look at what transpired in december and january or the first part of january we re feeling a lot better as we sit here today than we did at that point jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst got it and then maybe if we could touch on the southeast for a minute it sounds like atlanta is kind of a tale of two markets with some communities doing well and some not could you maybe dig down into that market a little further and how much of the weakness year over year and the order growth was driven by atlanta robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director unfortunately right now in the market it s i don t know if i can tell you that it s a tale of two cities it really across our portfolio it s kind of a tale of subdivision by subdivision and so when we look at it some of our sub divisions are slower than we d like and some are certainly performing according to expectations so i wouldn t isolate atlanta and say it s any different than what we re experiencing in other markets jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst the next question i had it looks based on the historical data you guys provided when after the wade jurney acquisition closed it looks like orders were down 10 for wade in 3q it looks like they re down 34 if i ve got my math right in 4q can you talk to us about the shift in strategy and what is weighing on order growth and presumably community growth for the wade jurney division right now robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director it s really order growth and as we talked about in the prepared remarks it s a shift that we made when wade jurney homes was a private company that had secured financing one of the requirements that they had was that they couldn t have very many specs so as a result what was being done is homes were sold oftentimes before we ever started construction and so what we did is we just push that later into the construction cycle as opposed to marketing and selling homes before we start construction since this is spec based business model we ve just pushed to downstream as we look at it we re not anticipating that that s going to impact our closings and we monitor our finished specs and as we indicated in the prepared remarks they re less than 3 of the homes that we have under construction in that business jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst got it robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director so it s really it was really an intentional shift on the sales side jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then dave could you maybe give us some insight into where you think gross margin and sg a margin are going to be for 1q david l messenger chief financial officer i d say for gross margin we are not providing any guidance in terms of how that s going to shake out and it really depends on the utilization of incentives and how that plays out from an sg a standpoint you can see that we put a lot of things into place during 2018 and we saw q4 sg a as a percent of revenue go down not only was it down as a percent but also our actual dollars on the fixed side were down sequentially from q3 to q4 and so we are not putting a percentage on i would expect that we would still see progress being made in 2019 so as sg a we would expect would come in lower than it did in 2018 jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst great thanks for taking my question dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman yes thanks jay operator thank you our next question is from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut jp morgan analyst thanks good afternoon everyone first question i guess i just wanted to obviously understandably like many of your peers withholding 2019 guidance at this time i guess i just wanted to perhaps get a little bit in terms of some basic goal post also perhaps some of your peers in terms of maybe how to think about things one of which if i heard you right you ended 2018 with did i hear that right 142 century communities robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director that s correct michael rehaut jp morgan analyst and so i m just curious obviously let s say it is all scenario based on current demand trends but if you can kind of share let s say the market doesn t take another major step down it doesn t take a major step up if you could perhaps share what you re thinking in terms of where we see that 122 go by the end of 2019 if you could give us any type of rough directional guidance i think in the past you ve talked about your core business maybe growing 10 on or off i don t know if that s a good place to start or if it should be a little bit lower given your greater size any thoughts there would be helpful robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director yes we would expect we have a variety of communities that we have planned to open and we would expect that at the end of 19 that our community count would be up slightly whether it s going to be up 10 or not there s a lot of water that has to go under the bridge but we would expect that we would have at least slightly positive community count growth during 2019 michael rehaut jp morgan analyst so up slightly to me reads more or like zero to five is that fair 10 does not sound 5 robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director when we look at it if at 122 10 is another 12 communities we could easily be up that but on the other hand if we were up six then it s only 5 but i don t think it s i don t think it s out of the question that we re up 10 i think we struggle with some of the same things that our peers do in that getting communities open sometimes takes longer than we anticipated it s going to do either because of weather or labor constraints but i think it s very possible that we could be at 10 as 10 up by time we get to the end of the year michael rehaut jp morgan analyst i appreciate that i guess secondly just going back to the gross margin for a moment again understanding if not wanted to provide full year but a lot of your peers have also kind of directionally pointed to the first quarter notwithstanding jay s question from before but the typical type of sequential decline in gross margins that we ve come across from the other builders have been in and around i mean it could range anywhere from 50 to as much as 150 or more type of a sequential gross margin decline from 4q to 1q you noted that you ve also like other builders have increased incentives during the fourth quarter and i assume you re more or less matching the market so i mean is it reasonable to think that 100 bps of a sequential gross margin decline is kind of in the card could it be more or less robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director that would not surprise me when we look at it as i said earlier we started backing off the concessions as we approach the beginning of december and we haven t felt the need to bring them back to the same level that we had them but a lot of that s going to depend on how traffic and sales continue going through but i would expect that we would see some downward movement in q1 and then at that point hopefully it stabilizes and continues to build back up to more normal levels michael rehaut jp morgan analyst great thank you and then just one last one if i could just on the shift of wade jurney just in terms of selling the homes more into the construction process i just wanted to make sure i understood the standards right are you doing that shift i guess there is two questions around this one are you doing that shift so that you re trying to better match material costs and labor costs with the pricing that you re offering number one what s the rationale behind that and number two just to understand also that while this might kind of inaudible a little bit with the orders that you are reporting you re not expecting any major changes from a closing standpoint in terms of the impact of this specific shift robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director both those comments or accurate mike i mean we re doing it because we want to make sure that when we sell a house that we have that house priced and in some cases you can t do that with everything if you re selling it before you start the house it also gives us better control over our backlog because we have the homebuyer under contract a shorter period of time and then the last comment that i ll reiterate is what you said is that is we do not expect that that s going to impact our closings so as a result from our standpoint it just makes complete sense without any real downside at all michael rehaut jp morgan analyst great thanks a lot robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director sure operator thank you our next question is from the line of thomas maguire with zelman associates please proceed with your question thomas maguire zelman associates analyst hey guys nice job navigating a tough environment here just to take the wade jurney discussion one step further i know we ve been really focused on expanding into different markets with that business and presumably that s generating some volume can you just help us think about what s going on maybe in the legacy markets and what the magnitude of clients there is and then just if we take a step back can you just talk about how you feel about the entry level and just the demand for that product relative to other price points and how it s performing versus your expectations robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director well taking the second part of the question first i mean we re very bullish on the entry level homebuyer and we started the transition several years ago to reduce our asp we re to the point now that we believe that about 75 of our business is price belowed the fha limits in the particular market and so that is the area of our business that we are the most focused on continuing to expand whether that s in the century communities brand or the wade jurney homes brand and so we have seen over time that there is resilience in that market we think there is more pricing power there over time and that s where we have been heading and we continue to keep heading in that direction thomas maguire zelman associates analyst got it and then can you maybe just talk about the comments you made on incentives and pulling them back through the quarter and that affecting demand just what s the kind of discussion that happens to get to that decision or maybe said another way what would cause you guys to increase incentives to incrementally drive growth from today s levels understanding january was down robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director it s really a function of what we need to do to drive sales as we look at our looked at our incentives we were i had them primarily on homes that could close in q4 so as we began approaching december the windows started closing rather rapidly for homes that we could sell and still close so we didn t feel the need to continuing to incent them to the same level into january we didn t add the incentives back on because january is a really tough time to sell homes particularly when we looked at what was going on in the overall homebuilding market with the hesitation in buyers and we candidly felt that markets would improve as we guide into the spring time and the government opened back up and all these other things and we just felt that in the long run we could sell the number of homes that we needed to as they approach completion and start with some margin as we went through thomas maguire zelman associates analyst got it thanks robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director sure operator thank you the next question is from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please proceed with your question timothy daley deutsche bank analyst hi this is tim daley on for nishu thanks for the time so my first one is just quickly on wade did you guys do any concessions on wade product in the quarter i m just seeing the backlogs down a little bit and just on that same kind of thread is that due to the new markets you re mixing into or something to do with the kind of changing spec start schedule robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director no it s we did have some incentives on in that business as well obviously not the same magnitude just given the difference in price point and the change in backlog was really driven by the change in the sales strategy with regard to the timing of when we were going to sell homes timothy daley deutsche bank analyst all right thank you for that color so i guess thinking moving on to the financial services so good job rolling it out nationally and kind of getting into the even the wade brand now so none of the kind of the pieces are in place how should we think about growth in this segment next year and maybe if you could kind of help us out with expected capture rate with how you ended in the fourth quarter or kind of any additional color would be really very helpful david l messenger chief financial officer yes hey tim this is dave i think from the financial services standpoint we ve been pleased with the growth that we are able to achieve in 2018 and as we ve been rolling out we rolled out middle of the year into the west coast markets as we terminated some legacy relationships they had there in inspire started taking over that and just here in the fourth quarter really near the end of the year we started up with the wade jurney brand and it s enrolling out there so right now we would say that we re priced still building an overall capture rate some of our legacy markets where we ve been around 15 16 months here in the mountain region more in the 60 to 70 mid 70 range on a capture rate the rest of the markets we were still building up to what we would consider to be kind of a target of somewhere in that 60 to 75 range timothy daley deutsche bank analyst all right that sounds very promising so and then final question here is capital allocation so you announced the buyback plan last quarter you did some solid buybacks this quarter and at the same time you got the leverage down to that kind of more in line with historical levels so now that you ve got leverage kind of where it s been in the past how are you thinking about capital allocation heading into 19 particularly kind of balancing any additional deleveraging future buybacks and then obviously land investment david l messenger chief financial officer yes this is dave i think that we look at our balance sheet and always going to maintain it to be fairly solid and strong we do have a long term goal of 50 from a leverage perspective and i think that as the investments we ve made over the past 18 months two years from ucp through wade jurney as those continue to mature and generate returns that will help us naturally delever when it comes to stock buybacks obviously we re successful in the fourth quarter and repurchasing nearly 700 000 shares we ll look at that all the time as another way to drive value for our stockholders and when it comes to capital allocation among the division we think that our portfolio and the products that we re offering is diverse enough that where we put the next dollar we re going to be able to generate the greatest returns timothy daley deutsche bank analyst got it thanks for the time robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director welcome david l messenger chief financial officer thanks tim operator thank you the next question is from the line of alex rygiel with b riley please proceed with your question alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst thanks for taking my question coming back to the wade jurney business sounds like you re entering a number of new markets in the short term how should we think about growth in that business category in 2019 versus 2018 should it be on a state by state basis should be on a community basis how should we think about growth dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman i think it s a little bit it s going to be a combination of several things right now as you re thinking about growth i would look at probably our historical backlog conversion rates for some form of proxy for growth for this year when it comes to sales we will be providing further guidance for you on that hopefully later in the year as we get a little bit more visibility into what the homebuyers are going to be doing and then additionally the new markets that we rolled out into last year those didn t have a significant impact in 2018 we d expect to see them play a little bit more of a role in 2019 alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst then when we d look to think about that business how many offices do you have now or sales centers do you have now versus pre merger dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman we got about 20 25 different sales offices right now and it s about static with where we were pre merger we ve had some closed we ve opened up a couple of new ones alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst that s helpful and then any comment on how weather might have impacted customer traffic either in the fourth quarter or in the month of january dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman it s when we look at it unfortunately we re always at the mercy of weather when we look at it given just our national platform somewhere we are going to be impacted by weather and so hopefully we ve got enough diversity now that it s not something that is going to be that detrimental to us in any one place unless it s something really unusual but it general it will impact us but hopefully we can overcome it with other geographies alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst thank you very much dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman welcome operator thank you our next question is from the line of alex barron with housing research center please proceed with your question alex barron housing research center analyst thank you hey guys i was hoping you could comment on your various regions just in general how you guys are thinking about how the year started off which regions are looking more promising and which ones are still little slower robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director well ending the fourth quarter the west region was the slowest on a year over year basis that as actually picked up slightly this year we feel a little bit encouraged with the west region based on where we finished last year at so again it s still too early to tell but it s looking more promising than we may have thought when we look at our mountain region that s continue to performed based on expectations our texas region has been really one of the bright spots spots alex and part of that is not just market driven but our strategy to go to the lower price points within the texas market and that s starting to pay dividends as we re getting into those projects that can offer that true entry level price point and a well located project and so that as you saw in the fourth quarter that s really the one region that we were up on a year over year basis quite significantly so again we feel good about that in the southeast again as dale mentioned a lot of it is based on subdivision by subdivision and we ve got some that we re doing very well in and others that are more challenging and more sanitized but again it s still early in the year but we re more encouraged now as we sit here in february than we were obviously a month ago even alex barron housing research center analyst now when you talk about the different challenges community which means especially in the southeast is that more having to do with price points or location robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director generally price points alex barron housing research center analyst got it and are your incentives also i guess more focused on those higher price points then robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director yes again that s the incentives as we ve seen as a general statement or commensurate with price points and as dale mentioned earlier on the wade jurney model we have had some incentives on that business model in the fourth quarter but they were very small in comparison and it relates to the price point where we ve had larger incentives on some of our highest higher price point offerings in our other regions so it s really on a price point driven basis alex barron housing research center analyst okay great thank you very much operator thank you we do have a follow up question from the line of jay mccanless with wedbush please proceed with your question jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst thanks for taking my follow up just a couple of foot points number one we ve heard some of your competitors talk about lumber prices coming in and that potentially being a gross margin tailwind how are you guys thinking about it and if it is when should we expect that to hit ph dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman i mean we re seeing the same thing some of the homes a lot of the homes actually that closed in q4 were bought out previously at higher lumber numbers lumber is down and again it down what component you re looking at but as much as 25 and that definitely is a tailwind we see that coming into play especially on the quicker build entry level product that we can get up and close quickly we see that coming into play in the latter part of q1 and certainly into q2 jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then just wondering some of the travel we done we ve seen that there is maybe in excess in some communities or some markets and not just for century but all the builders of steaming speculative inventory how are you guys feeling about your finished specs right now do you feel like you need to be more aggressive on that and is that something that may continue to weigh on the gross margin as you work in that number now dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman from a consolidated basis for century both the century brand and wade jurney brand we don t have a lot of completed specs with that said though we are cautious on what specs we re starting which communities we re doing that in and we re just taking a much more conservative approach to that than maybe we would have done a year ago but we re not seeing that from our business standpoint as a problem to gross margin headwinds robert j francescon co chief executive officer and director and jay that s one of the reasons that we felt we could back off on the incentives in december because we were focused on homes that could close in q4 and we looked at what we had we didn t have a lot of inventory that was completed or completing that we felt we had to continue to incent jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay got it and then on to be built were incentives running on those right now and how does that compare to maybe a year ago and year end david l messenger chief financial officer on to be built the incentives are right now running generally less than what you ll see on a spec and so when we look back a year ago it s kind of hard to compare to that but it s probably not a lot higher now than it was then jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay thanks again dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman you re welcome david l messenger chief financial officer thanks jay operator thank you it appears there are no further questions at this time so i d like to pass the floor back over to dale francescon for any additional concluding comments dale francescon co chief executive officer and chairman thank you

looking statements included in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our 2017 form 10 k and subsequent reports filed with the sec these are also available on our website now i would like to turn the call over to rick richard thornberry chief executive officer thank you emily and good morning thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in radian i m delighted to report another outstanding quarter and year for our company these results are a testament to the hard work of the entire radian team across all of our businesses from mortgage insurance and risk services to title mortgage and real estate services i d like to take a moment now to recognize the team and to thank our customers investors and business partners for helping us deliver such exceptional results 2018 was a year where we delivered on our strategy in a consistent manner but also celebrated several first for the company we wrote 56 billion of flow niw which set a company record for highest flow volume in our more than 40 year history net premiums earned exceeded 1 billion and we grew primary insurance in force 10 year over year to 221 billion we executed the mortgage industry s first ever simultaneous iln and xol reinsurance placement which has enhanced our capital efficiency and strengthened our risk profile we improved our financial flexibility with a 450 million return on capital from radian guaranty to radian group and we ve aligned all of our businesses and products under the radian brand to reflect the combined strength of our unified team and these are just a few highlights from an outstanding year before i turn the call over to frank to cover our financial position i d like to take the opportunity to review some of our other topics in terms of financial performance net income for the fourth quarter grew to 140 million or 0 64 per share net income for the full year 2018 was 606 million or 2 77 per share adjusted diluted net operating income per share increased 48 year over year to 2 69 return on equity was 18 7 and adjusted net operating return on equity was 18 2 for 2018 in terms of our mortgage insurance business we wrote 12 7 billion of niw in the fourth quarter which as i mentioned earlier contributed to our record breaking volume of new flow business written in 2018 of 56 5 billion this is our third consecutive year of record breaking annual volume and we are pleased with the projected economic value of this new business which we expect to provide significant earnings and attractive returns for shareholders given our projections based on industry forecasts including a slight decline in the overall mortgage origination market but a modest increase in purchase originations we expect to write new mi business in 2019 in the range of 50 billion this would be in line with a record breaking levels of niw we have achieved over the past three years and similar to our guidance a year ago as i ve said before this is a great time to be in the mortgage insurance business the business fundamentals are incredibly strong supported by an excellent credit environment and with guardrails in place for mortgage lending and servicing under dodd frank and our mortgage insurance industry is governed by clear consistent and transparent risk based capital requirements under pmiers and operating guidelines with a uniform master policy there is also continued demand for private mortgage insurance looking ahead to 2019 industry projections suggests a mortgage origination market that is relatively flat to 2018 but with a 4 increase in purchase loans this is a positive trend for our mortgage insurance industry given the purchase loans are three to five times more likely to have mi versus a refinance loan during this past quarter purchase loans accounted for 95 of our niw housing demand is also expected to remain strong given more stability in both mortgage rates and home price growth coupled with expected wage growth this combination provides for a stable and healthy real estate market during our last earnings call we discussed how the mortgage insurance industry was continuing to evolve away from a pure rate card pricing model to an environment where mi market participants will deploy a variety of pricing methodologies at radian while our pricing options are all risk based in nature they have different levels of granularity and are delivered to our customers based on their individual needs and loan origination processes just last month we introduced radar rates an mi pricing option where each rate quote is finally tuned to a borrowers individual risk profile and loan attributes this increased granularity allows us to more dynamically shape the risk profile of our mi portfolio and ultimately the economic value of the business that we write we believe that the combination of flexible pricing options excellent customer service and outstanding business relationships is the right market strategy to both address our customers needs and provide an attractive risk adjusted return for radian after only a few weeks into market radar rate is gaining is already gaining traction among our customers and those for those who have chosen to adopt it the transition has been seamless turning to our mortgage insurance portfolio our record new business volume combined with favorable persistency drove a 10 increase in our mortgage insurance in force portfolio year over year our 221 billion mortgage insurance portfolio which is one of the largest in our industry is the primary driver of our future earnings for the company it is important to note that the projected economic value of this portfolio is not reflected in the current period financial statements nor is it reflected in our reported book value but it is expected to be recognized over time importantly the value for this portfolio provides us with significant strategic financial flexibility we continue to benefit from positive credit trends in 2018 webcast slide nine includes a breakdown of our total mortgage insurance portfolio which illustrates this positive credit environment and its impact on our company today 94 of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force including harp loans consist of business written after 2008 and it s important to highlight that the performing loans in the remaining pre 2009 portfolio also include harp loans more than half has never been in default now moving to our services segment we made great progress during 2018 and focusing title mortgage and real estate services on our core products and capabilities our services segment generated positive services adjusted ebitda across each quarter of 2018 with revenue and services adjusted ebitda margin in line with our guidance for the second half of 2018 we remain confident we have the customer relationships and team in place to grow revenues increase the financial contribution and build value across the segment consistent with radian s growth and diversification strategy during the year we increased our core capabilities through three small but strategic acquisitions these new companies help to increase our footprint across our core title mortgage and real estate services adding new real estate information valuation and risk management tools to our existing product suite as well as proprietary disruptive technologies data analytics and predictive models in a competitive mortgage insurance market we continue to believe that these capabilities uniquely position us with our customers in terms of capital management as we reported this morning the pennsylvania insurance department approved a 450 million return on capital from radian guaranty to radian group during the fourth quarter of 2018 this return of capital is part of our long term capital plan which is designed to improve our financial flexibility and capital position for example we plan to use a portion of these proceeds to retire our 159 million of senior notes with due in june of 2019 during our last earnings call we announced the launch of a capital markets transaction which was the mortgage insurance industry s first simultaneous mortgage insurance linked notes and excess of loss insurance placement we believe there are a number of strategic benefits from leveraging and regularly assessing both the capital and reinsurance markets to distribute risk including increased financial flexibility a reduction of our overall cost of capital enhance capital efficiency and most importantly the opportunity to reduce portfolio and financial volatility through economic cycles we believe the execution of our capital plan will enhance our already strong capital structure and further demonstrate our commitment to effectively manage capital for our shareholders we look forward to providing updates on our progress turning to the regulatory and legislative landscape we remain actively engaged with key legislators in washington on the topics most important to our company and we continue to be encouraged by the support for an increased role for private capital including private mortgage insurance we believe our industry is well positioned for any new housing and finance framework that may develop however it remains difficult to determine exactly what shape that framework will ultimately take and when we are also closely following the upcoming change in leadership at the fhfa while we do not know what actions this change may bring we do know that mark calabria has been nominated and is awaiting confirmation as fhfa director while joe otting of the occ is the acting director both issuing support for an increased role of private capital and for reducing taxpayer exposure finally we believe that our industry continues to gain share from the fha on higher fica business and that it remains unlikely that the fha will reduce its pricing the fha s focus appears to be on modernizing its internal systems and processes now i would like to turn the call over to frank for details of our financial position j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer thank you rick and good morning everyone to recap our financial results reported earlier this morning we reported net income of 139 8 million or 0 64 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 0 66 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018 and 0 03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 full year 2018 net income was 606 million or 2 77 per diluted share compared to 121 1 million or 0 55 per diluted share for the full year 2017 the year over year increase was primarily driven by the 2017 impact of an incremental tax provision of 102 6 million resulting from the tax law change as well as the pre tax impairment of goodwill and other required intangible assets related to our services segment of 200 2 million adjusted diluted net operating income was 0 70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 1 to the third quarter of 2018 an increase of 37 over the same quarter last year adjusted diluted net operating income for the full year 2018 was 2 69 a 48 increase over prior year i will now focus on some of the drivers of our adjusted diluted net operating results for the quarter and the full year i ll start with the key drivers of our revenue our new insurance written was 12 7 billion during the quarter compared to 15 8 billion last quarter and 14 4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 we wrote 56 5 billion of niw a 5 increase over full year 2017 in addition to record volume we continue to enhance the product mix of our new business monthly and other renewal premium niw represented 83 of our niw this quarter on a full year basis monthly premium niw increased 7 in 2018 compared to 2017 borrower paid single premium policies represented 12 of our niw this quarter while lender paid single premium policies declined to 5 of our volume this quarter a year ago nearly all of our single premium niw was lender paid this shift in business mix is expected intentional and designed to improve the return profile of our single premium business overall as borrower paid singles have higher expected returns than lender paid policies in total borrower paid policies represented 94 of our new business for the fourth quarter the new business we are writing today continues to consist of loans that are expected to produce excellent risk adjusted returns primary insurance in force increased to 221 4 billion at the end of the quarter our fourth excuse me our fourth consecutive quarter with year over year insurance in force growth of 10 it is important to note that monthly premium insurance in force increased 12 year over year and has grown by over 29 billion over the past two years as rick previously mentioned the in force portfolio is the primary source of our future earned premiums and as such is expected to generate future earnings that are not reflected in the current period financial statements nor reflected in our reported book value the economic value of our portfolio is expected to be recognized in the book value over time persistency trends remain positive and our 12 month persistency rate increased to 83 1 in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 81 4 in the third quarter of 2018 our quarterly persistency was 85 5 this quarter which is the highest level we have observed in recent years our direct in force premium yield was 49 basis points this quarter compared to 48 6 basis points last quarter and 48 1 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 as seen on slide 10 net premium yield decline slightly from 47 8 basis points in the prior quarter to 47 4 basis points this quarter primarily driven by ceded premium associated with our recent iln xol transaction net mortgage insurance premiums earned were 261 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 258 4 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 245 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 this 7 increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to our insurance in force growth on a full year basis net premiums earned exceeded 1 billion and grew by 8 in 2018 compared to 2017 or 10 after adjusting for lower single premium acceleration observed in 2018 compared to 2017 total services segment revenue increased slightly to 41 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 40 9 million for the third quarter of 2018 and 41 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the revenue increases on a linked quarter basis includes 1 5 million of services revenue from our recent acquisition of independent settlement services a national appraisal and title management services company our reported services adjusted ebitda was 3 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding the 1 2 million impact of both restructuring charges and the operating impact of our 2018 acquisitions the services adjusted ebitda would have been 4 4 million it is important to note that since the restructuring of our services businesses in the third quarter of 2017 services adjusted ebitda has been consistently positive and there has been substantial improvements in the operational and financial aspects of the business our investment income this quarter was 42 million an 8 increase over the prior quarter and a 25 increase over prior year due to both higher rates and higher balances in our investment portfolio we are continually looking for ways to enhance the performance of our investment portfolio and apply our management expertise to produce greater investment income while also being mindful of asset and liability duration matching and risk levels moving now to our loss provision and credit quality as noted on slide 14 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we had positive reserve development on prior period defaults of 13 8 million this positive development was driven primarily by a reduction in assumed claim rates on existing defaults based on observed trends including an increase in cure rates on these defaults the default to claim rate applied to new primary defaults received in the quarter which reflects recent observed trends was approximately 8 compared to 8 5 in the third quarter of 2018 and 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we believe that if observed trends continue default to claim rates could fall further over the likelihood and timing of this decline are difficult to predict the total number of new defaults increased by 7 compared to the third quarter of 2018 consistent with typical seasonal patterns and decreased by 31 5 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as a reminder the fourth quarter of 2017 included an elevated level of new defaults in fema designated areas associated with 2017 hurricanes webcast slide 16 shows the defaults trends associated with 2017 fema designated areas over the past five quarters as expected most of the new defaults we received between 2017 of september and february 2018 in these areas has cured and the total default count in these areas has returned to pre hurricane levels as economic indicators have continued their positive trends cumulative loss ratios on our post 2008 business continue to track at historically low levels overall the performance of our portfolio remains strong with positive trends continuing our primary mi risk in force now consists of 94 of business written after 2008 including harp loans and there is greater predictability around the pre 2009 portfolio now turning to expenses other operating expenses were 77 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 70 1 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 66 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the primary drivers of the increase in expenses were higher incentive compensation and benefits based on year to date performance of approximately 5 5 million and incremental expenses related to the operations of businesses acquired in 2018 of approximately 4 1 million moving now to taxes our overall effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 21 and our expectation for 2019 annualized effective tax rate before discrete items is approximately the statutory rate of 21 and now moving to capital as rick mentioned with respect to the capital activities for this quarter in november and as previously announced we closed on an insurance linked note transaction of approximately 434 million and 21 million of additional excess of loss reinsurance for total risk distribution of 455 million assuming continued favorable market conditions we would expect to utilize these forms of risk distribution on a recurring basis going forward and would announce any such actions upon completion we expect that this prudent risk distribution strategy and our disciplined capital management will continue to enhance our risk profile and improve our financial flexibility as a result of a long series of capital enhancement actions and our continued strong financial performance in december 2018 following the approval of the pennsylvania insurance department radian guaranty returned 450 million of capital to its parent radian group the utilization of the enhanced capital flexibility is expected to include retirement of the next maturity of debt which occurs in june 2019 of approximately 159 million and once eliminated would reduce our debt to capital ratio by approximately 4 percentage points bringing our debt to total capital to approximately 20 holding company liquidity at the end of this quarter was 714 million compared to 246 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 the increase in the holding company liquidity during the fourth quarter was primarily due to the 450 million return of capital from radian guaranty under the current pmiers after consideration of this return of capital radian guaranty had available assets of 3 5 billion and our minimum required assets were 2 9 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter 2018 the excess available assets over the minimum required assets of 567 million represents a 19 pmiers cushion and a 37 million increase from the prior quarter we have also noted on slide 20 our pmiers excess available resources on a consolidated basis of 1 5 billion which if fully utilized represents 51 of our minimum required assets we believe that our ongoing risk distribution strategy coupled with organic growth in pmiers available assets should be sufficient to cover a broad range of potential capital actions under pmiers 2 0 as well including contemplation of additional capital distributions from radian guaranty to radian group these actions may include a request of our pennsylvania regulator for a repayment of the 100 million surplus notes and or a request for additional returns of capital after calibrating for an appropriate pmiers cushion at the operating company under the new pmiers 2 0 we expect the pmiers cushion to be sufficient to support projected organic growth and support potential volatility such as a cyclical economic downturn i m sure there will be many questions about our future capital plans but i should remind you that we have demonstrated the ability to execute our capital plan and our practice is to inform you on the elements of this plan as the events occur and we look forward to updating you as our progress continues i will now turn the call back over to rick richard thornberry chief executive officer thank you frank before we open the call to questions i d like to invite those of you who are interested and learning more about radian to join us for an investor day on tuesday may 7 in philadelphia more information will be coming to you shortly now operator we d like to take questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question today comes from the line of randy binner with b riley fbr please go ahead randy binner b riley fbr analyst hi good morning i think i ll start on the capital front and i guess there s two pieces to the question one going back to the iln was that how was that accounted for from kind of a required capital versus absolute capital position meaning it didn t seem like that all went into your capital line but some of it may have been reflected in the required capital for the pmiers calculation and then just the other piece was right at the end of your comments about what would an appropriate cushion maybe look like trying to adjust for the senior notes paydown and the surplus note as well potentially j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer sure thanks for the question randy this is frank so the insurance linked notes are accounted for just as traditional excess of loss reinsurance so when you think about it from a capital perspective especially as it relates to pmiers it s a reduction in the minimum required assets so when we talk about pmiers capital it s really just a reduction in that requirement and so we reflected as such but the accounting of it is identical to excess of loss reinsurance and then i think the second part of your question related to cushions and how we contemplate those going forward and as i shared with you in my prepared remarks it s part of the overall capital planning that we do and as you can see through the fourth quarter we had a lot of activities going on as related to the iln the return of capital from pennsylvania et cetera and then also contemplating what pmiers 2 0 looks like for us as an organization as we put that against our organic growth plans and also taking into account some volatility associated with the potential for an economic downturn so taking all of these things into account it s hard to put a finer number on it but as we look at our projection is to have under as noted on slide 20 is to have if pmiers 2 0 were effective today it would be roughly a 12 cushion and so as you think about it in those the 12 10 15 i mean those types of numbers certainly in the near term feel like an appropriate range but i would just caution you that all of those things are subject to change just simply as we look forward and plan for the unexpected randy binner b riley fbr analyst fair enough the one follow up i have then is you mentioned organic growth plan but the niw you discussed would be down something like 10 and i understand that that s being conservative but is that really the plan that you would be down that much in niw because that would actually free up a lot of capital i would think j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes those are the actual results we haven t disclosed anything about our future plans for niw randy binner b riley fbr analyst oh i m sorry i thought you said around 50 billion richard thornberry chief executive officer this is rick we did we said it would be around 50 billion for 2019 i think as we said last year as well and by the way when you think about capital requirements in this business it s really the growth in the insurance in force portfolio year over year so current niw at that level would result in a growth in our portfolio but we given the capital we generate every quarter we do believe that we are very capital strong company now both in terms of existing capital structure as frank mentioned that pmiers really looking at the operating company but when you look at the combined capital strength across on a consolidated basis with the capital we have at holdco as well this is a very strong well capitalized entity with a lot of financial flexibility and so yes even with the assumption that we will do around 50 billion next year we ll see growth in the insurance in force portfolio and apply capital accordingly randy binner b riley fbr analyst okay thank you operator we have a question from mark devries with barclays mark devries barclays analyst frank you may have pre empted me a little bit with some of your prepared comments i m going to ask about capital returns anyway i understand you re not going to be specific could you just talk about how you re thinking about your options for capital returns at the linked company and how you would prioritize this year and then finally kind of is there a minimum cash balance that you would want to maintain at the holding company j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes a great question thanks mark yes so put it in the broad context again of just capital planning overall and you think about the conversations that we re having among the management team and our board of directors the full range of options get discussed and but primarily what we re looking to do is make sure that we have sufficient capital to support the business and our expected growth overall and then as we think about the capital flexibility that could be derived from further risk distribution further upstream of capital from the operating company to the holding company and we think about targeted leverage ratios and things of that nature and the full range of options get discussed and i think what you ve seen from us historically is that we re opportunistic about returns of capital to shareholders traditionally we ve done it through share buybacks but again as we re looking at the capital plan we are in a great position of strength and so that does allow us to contemplate a broader range but again all of those things are being looked at and contemplated but in the context of the overall capital plan mark devries barclays analyst okay understood and then just i know you re not going to be more specific about what options you re going to address now but when you think about buybacks is the stock an evaluation here where it looks attractive to you guys in terms of being kind of at or below intrinsic value j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes that s a great question and i would just point you to how we ve managed our share repurchases historically and we certainly can t peg a price and say that that s what we re managing to but our share repurchase program historically have been value based in nature and we see that view around share repurchases likely to continue but you hit the nail on the head on value relative to intrinsic value is one of the metrics that we look at certainly book value as well so without pegging it to a number i would just broadly categorize it as value based mark devries barclays analyst okay and then just finally a follow up on your comments around the pmiers cushion it sounds like you feel comfortable with that 12 15 range here does that imply that if you sell the cycle start to look a little bit more concerning to you that you probably flex that cushion up if you re a little bit more concerned about kind of the forward outlook for the business j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer well certainly that part of the purpose of having the cushion is to deal with the volatility associated with potential for economic downturn i would tell you that we contemplate some level of that as we do our capital planning overall and i would also just caution around pegging to 10 to 15 cushion i would say ordinary course that that s a comfortable level but to your point if circumstances change we would manage it in a current context richard thornberry chief executive officer and i think mark to frank s point when you look at the overall capital strength of the business between opco between radian guaranty and radian group you ve got a significant amount of capital financial flexibility and we have the ability to look at it holistically and be very thoughtful about how we allocate capital to future uses and i think the other part of it is as frank and i ve talked about in previous quarters one of the great things about having a strong insurance in force portfolio provides a significant strength capital flexibility as a source of capital as well so we ve distributed very little of our risk in force and i think it continues to provide us a tremendous amount of flexibility around capital mark devries barclays analyst okay got it thank you operator we have a question from bose george with kbw please go ahead bose george kbw analyst so just following up on this capital in terms of future use of the iln market is that likely to be if you do it is that likely to be on 2018 and future production is there any reason to do anything with the older books and also just given your excess capital position how does that play into your position to use many more iln j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer thanks bose for that question i think i would just broadly describe it i think rick has said this in the past as well we are in a very fortunate position to not have a need to do anything in the insurance linked note market our capital position is very strong and it s sufficient to support our organic growth going forward so you think about how we utilized ilns on a go forward basis it really is with an eye toward shaping the portfolio from a risk management standpoint and optimizing into that regard so as it pertains to any particular vintage or any particular portfolio we re careful to evaluate that in a context of what s right for us from a risk management standpoint so i would want to just come out and say on a wholesale basis it will look like this on a repeated basis we re going to look for the opportunities to do what s right for our portfolio primarily from a risk management context bose george kbw analyst okay it makes sense thanks and then actually just switching to the iln expense can you remind us when that sort of when it started hitting the p l this quarter and the full impact of that going forward just in basis points j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer sure so we first took the charge excuse me took the expense into the run rate in november and it s roughly 0 5 basis point bose george kbw analyst and the 0 5 basis point was the impact just for this quarter you mean j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer that s an annualized number bose george kbw analyst that s an annualized number okay perfect thank you operator we have a question from doug harter with credit suisse please go ahead douglas harter credit suisse analyst can you talk about what your target debt to capital ratio might be longer term and how you would think about kind of your maturities beyond the 2019 j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer sure so what we have said historically is that our debt to capital ratio is due to a couple of lens it s really in our overall capital planning but also with an eye toward rating agencies we ve said historically that we would like to return to investment grade and so we think it s important to have a capital structure that would support that conclusion from the rating agencies so as you think about our debt maturities we ve got the june 2019 coming up which is about 159 million the next after that is the june 2020 of 234 million i would say that we are again just viewing all of those things through a much much broader lens of overall capital planning but the debt to capital in particular is one that we think operating in the low 20s is an appropriate place to support a rating agency view of investment grade and should they choose to do so douglas harter credit suisse analyst great thank you operator we have a question from phil stefano with deutsche bank please go ahead phil stefano deutsche bank analyst going back to the i think it was the mid august announcement that there was a repurchase authorization i was under the impression there was going to be 10b 5 program in place and i guess i m a little surprised that the stock wasn t at the value that the 10b 5 would have had you actively repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter and i was hoping you could talk around that was there a 10b 5 in place j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer great question phil the way that i would characterize the and you re correct there was a share repurchase authorization in place has been since i believe june of the prior year when we were going through and looking at the capital plan and again all of these capital related levers that we re speaking to are always viewed in the context of the overall capital plan and so the landscape throughout the last half of the year was viewed through the lens of pmiers 2 0 it was viewed through the lens of issuing our first iln and xol structure it was viewed through the lens of the dividend or excuse me the return of capital that we requested of pa and so as we look through all of those options and opportunities it was i would say sufficient capital activities that we felt comfortable landing where we did and you ll also noticed and nobody has asked this just yet but the surplus note that we had in place at the end of last year also remains in place at the end of this year and so as we think about the things that we re managing toward for year end 2018 we felt that what we accomplished in the fourth quarter was appropriate for our capital structure phil stefano deutsche bank analyst no i agree i guess my thought was always that the 10b 5 program operated on its own and when the stock was of a evaluation that the 10b 5 program prescribed you d be buying back shares j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes so that is certainly one option that we have to utilize the share repurchase program i won t comment on the specifics around how we ve utilized it thus far you are correct in your statement but that is that s only one way to manage your share repurchase program phil stefano deutsche bank analyst got it understood ok and then switching gears i was hoping to talk about radar rates how many pricing inputs are you currently utilizing and do you have a number of metrics in mind where it hits the tipping point that you ve kind of hit scale derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services this is derek so i m not going to get into exactly how many pricing imports we utilized i consider that kind of proprietary information the way to look at it and the way we look at the pricing input is kind of utilizing our proprietary modeling we have a lot of the inputs back and we use for kind of its predictive power so when we re kind of determining what we re going to use for pricing it s really balancing what variables are going to predict loan performance also factoring in the operational complexity for our customers to actually utilize those in pricing and then also taking into account the competitive landscape so with respect to that we have an ability to add or kind of subtract variables i would say this in terms of number of variables in terms of unique rates you come up with the variables currently in the system it will be over a million different rates that you can kind of come up with the various combinations phil stefano deutsche bank analyst got it okay thanks guys best of luck operator we have a question from jack micenko with sig please go ahead jack micenko sig analyst i guess first question looking at some of the it looks like some share shift in the fourth quarter and then rick your guide on the 50 of niw down pretty significantly is there anything that you re doing or pulling away from business wise that maybe is driving some of that richard thornberry chief executive officer so just in terms of the 50 just and by the way thank you for the question jack i think in terms of the 50 just keep in mind that s exactly what we said last year as well and i think we certainly over performed or outperformed that number i think as we look at the market today and i think as we ve said for the past several quarters we are less focused on market share and more focused on building economic value and the construction of our portfolio for long term returns for our shareholders and so as we think about the business today and as we have for the last few years we re focused on doing business with the customers that we believe do business in the right way and with both originate and service in the right way so i think as brien mcmahon likes to say often we fight for every niw policy that fits our profile and i think as you see the market shifting today it s really evolving to our strength but we have to be mindful that we re in the business of value creation not market share and not i ve been in the mortgage industry for a long long time and i ve never seen anybody went on market share you went on focused on value i think value creation thinking very thoughtfully about where you do business profitably versus just do business and so our approach and derek and i and frank and the rest of the team we are very very focused on making sure that the business we do is of high quality at the right risk adjusted returns and that we re doing business with the customers that originate and service loans in a quality way so i think what differentiates us in the market is really how analytical we are about our approach to the business so things like risk based pricing granular pricing play to our strength given our proprietary analytics but we go beyond that is to really we use of analytics to determine who the right customers are what the how do we help them become more profitable more effective through our relationship with them whose services are risk because remember one of the great first things i learned when i got to this business is other people service our risk every day so whose services are risk well how does it all play together from an long term sustainable value point of view so from our guidance that we gave this morning i would not read anything into that in terms of kind of year over year kind of market share thoughts but what i would want you to hear is that our focuses has not been and won t be as long as i m here and i think the rest of the team is on market share purely but i think our sales team and the relationships we have in the marketplace working with our great customers i think we re able to grow a very valuable and profitable business here and we couldn t do it without the team in the field working with our customers and the customers value working with us so i feel very good about where we re at feel very good about how we re playing approaching the market and quite frankly i think the market changes play to our strength and being well capitalized very analytical great customer relationships delivering great service is the winning combination jack micenko sig analyst alright great and then i guess one for frank how do we think about expense the operating expense line in 2019 i guess my question is does radian leverage in 2019 on the expense ratio versus 2018 and aside to that the 4 million correct me if i m wrong the 4 million of deal expenses that was in operating why isn t that in the services expense line or am i confusing the multiple speakers j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer it is yes when you yes it is it is in services and it is in our yes it is in our operating expense line on a consolidated richard thornberry chief executive officer but it doesn t reflect deal expenses ongoing operating expenses of the acquired entities j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer that s correct and so just broadly and great question on expenses the way that we have evolved our analysis and management of expenses is to look at it on an operating leverage basis and you ve heard me say for years now that positive operating leverage is our objective which simply means our revenues are growing at a faster rate than our expenses are so while we certainly pay attention to the absolute level of expenses as we start to bring in different types of businesses as well we think that s the right metric to use for the management of that and so if you look at the full year of 2018 we had revenue growth of 8 we had expense growth of 1 so that creates positive operating leverage of 7 and that is a very strong number and so as we look for ways to lever the business as you say that s what we re looking toward jack micenko sig analyst and is it safe to assume that that trend should continue or at least that s your goal j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes so as we would expect the positive operating leverage to continue now i will tell you that it s a relatively sensitive metric to expenses and depending upon whether we re bringing in new businesses investing in them or acquiring new businesses whose financial performance has not yet been optimized that could change slightly but we ll be sure to call out those items when they occur operator we have a question from chris gamaitoni with compass point please go ahead chris gamaitoni compass point analyst most of my questions have been answered i guess just a final follow up is this question was asked but i don t think we got a clear answer how do you view holding co cash requirements is this some type of run rate or holdco expenses or just how do we envision on a long term basis how you view what how much capital you need at the holdco j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer great question this is frank again i ll bring it back to the overall capital planning that we do we view it as certainly a place where we have the most financial flexibility and we would expect to manage that at the appropriate level given what our future plans and expectations are in the context of that long range capital plan it s available truly for anything but on a near term basis certainly 159 million of the upcoming 2019 maturities the other thing that we look to as well as our credit facility which is available to us and so when we look at that combination there i think we ve managed it very well over time and we have continued to build strength in the combination of the hard cash if you will in that credit facility and that credit facility really is also a testament to the enhanced financial strength that radian has achieved over the past several years and so to peg it to a hard number or a multiple of anything and some companies do that as far as interest coverage or years of interest expense radian is also in a very fortunate position to have an interest and tax sharing arrangement where through an agreement that we have in place with our subsidiary we don t need to request special dividends or returns of capital to deal with the operating expenses and the interest expense associated with that debt so as you look at again back to financial flexibility we really have achieved a tremendous amount of financial flexibility to deal with any of the burdens both known and potentially unknown that we didn t encounter so again hopefully that s helpful chris gamaitoni compass point analyst and one probably for derek how do we think about reserve adequacy at this point maybe just like where default to claim rates are relative to historical basis obviously there has been reserve releases over time but just like any perspective on if there is still room to go down versus what call it a normalized level would be derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services well you are not going to be surprised in terms of where we think we are from a reserve perspective we think we re appropriately reserved so that s kind of an easy one but in terms of looking at it kind of historically and you look at those roll ph rates on new defaults those are getting at pretty low levels i think the lowest we ve seen them historically on kind of the new defaults is ultimate roll ph to claim rate of about 8 so we re kind of down to those levels so obviously if you continue to see positive economic development home price appreciation you could potentially see continued positive development but i m not going to really speculate in terms of how much we positive development we would have embedded if any operator we have a question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst really quickly just in your premium yields i was looking at slide 10 the in force premium yield it s been trending higher for the last couple of quarters which is i think a little surprising given concerns around pricing and the fact that you put in new pricing last year and i was just wondering what is driving that is it mix or something else j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes that is a great question this is frank as you look at the change i think what you ll pick up on and you obviously have there is an uptick but it s due primarily to a little bit of mix shift a little bit of seasonality and there was just a very small accounting adjustment in there so you add up the combined impact of those three it looks like a trend and i wouldn t read too much into it though mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then with the new pricing and will ph that you put in place how does that pricing compare to the old pricing so like lets say if it s go all your business was running on that in q4 what would that have looked like any chance you d alter that derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services this is derek so the one thing we look at it really from a return perspective so in terms of the exact pricing and the way that filters through that s going to depend upon your particular mix of business so when we ve rolled it out i would say the response has been very positive so we ve had as rick indicated we ve indicated in the past once we are ready to go it would be pretty seamless and that s what we found so we found significant transition lenders moving in which is a positive and so far as it allows us to more dynamically and effectively manage the risk mix of our portfolio the risk return profile and ultimately optimize the economic value so when we re looking at it i wouldn t just look at kind of premiums overall it s really how that translates depending upon the variables we use to price into a return and from that perspective we haven t changed our return target for the business overall mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and just so i understand how dynamic is it in the sense how often do you or can you go in and change the pricing whether you see something that you don t like or something that looks particularly attractive or you see as an opportunity is it a lot more dynamic now derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services very dynamic so and i would say we will change pricing as often as we need to and buyout often as we need to it s really balancing all those things in terms of customer right what they need what they can deliver and also what we need to do in order to maximize the risk return profile of the business coming in so to the extent we see mix shifts that we re not comfortable with or seeing kind of product shifts that could be driven by consumers in the market it could be driven by competitors our ability to switch that pricing and do it frequently is very dynamic we can do that kind of as often as we need to richard thornberry chief executive officer i would just add to derek s point because i think this is a really important point for everyone which is the analytic framework we have in our business enables us to do that on a real time basis so it s a combination of kind of the technology and the connectivity we have with our customers to deliver the price and the analytics that we have supporting it again i go back to my comment earlier this whole change i believe plays to our strength and when you re driven by market share and volume on one end versus one who is focused and is long term focused on delivering the economic value this is a great time to be in the mortgage insurance industry with the tools that we have mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you for that one last question on claims paid the number i think was 37 ish million this quarter is down and i understand that the volume of claims paid is going down too but even adjusting for that if i look at it over the couple of years it feels like it s been trending lower and i was wondering is there something that s driving that i mean the reason why it would keep going lower or higher going forward derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services you are talking about the aggregate claims paid number mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes whether it s the aggregate or even on a per paid basis if you well derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services alright yes so some of that s going to be driven by couple of factors one just our default inventory is decreasing right year over year so your aggregate number is going to go down and when you look at it on a per claims basis a lot of that is going to be driven by kind of the geographies that are kind of coming through as claims right so to the extent you have relatively higher concentrations and higher balanced states like california that s going to affect your claims paid number as well so it s really a combination the aggregate size of your default inventory and then i would say that distribution within it in terms of how long they ve been in default and kind of the geographic location of those outstanding defaults it s really going to be those factors and as a result of those things you can have some movement up and down kind of quarter to quarter mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay but there is no reason why the trend should be lower or something like that just looking out to the next year or two claims for default again claims for default not on aggregate i get the aggregate point i m just saying even if i just bake the total claims paid divided by the number of claim number of claims paid you see that number is trending low derek brummer senior executive vice president mortgage insurance risk services i would say that in terms of the trend on a per loan basis no i don t see a reason to think of it going particularly one direction or another you can just see kind of volatility around that number over time mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great thank you thanks for taking my questions operator our last question today comes from the line of geoffrey dunn with dowling and partners please go ahead geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst frank was there any iln cost in the premium line this quarter and what is the expectation on a quarterly run rate for call it first half of next year j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes so the cost is amortized over the expected life of the iln and i mentioned earlier the ongoing cost associated with the iln is about 0 5 basis point geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst what s it sort of dollars j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes whatever the math on that we re got to be i can find it for you geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst i guess specifically for the quarter how much hit or did any hit j franklin hall senior executive vice president chief financial officer for the quarter it started in november so we get two out of three months 2 3 million geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst great thank you operator mr dunn did you have any additional questions geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst i do
