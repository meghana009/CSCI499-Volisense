jun 13 2019 alasdair macleod this article is a wake up call for those who do not understand the true purpose of monetary inflation and do not realise they are the suckers being robbed by monetary policy with the world facing a deepening recession monetary inflation will accelerate again it is time for everyone to recognise the consequences introduction all this year i have been warning in a series of goldmoney insight articles that the turn of the credit cycle and the rise of american protectionism was the same combination that led to the wall street crash in 1929 32 and the depression that both accompanied and followed it those who follow statistics are now seeing the depressing evidence that history is rhyming though they have yet to connect the dots understandably their own experience is more relevant to them than the empirical evidence in history books they would benefit hugely from a study of the destructive power of the smoot hawley tariff act combining with the end of the 1920s credit expansion the devastating synergy between the two is what crippled the american and global economy and as we slide into a renewed economic torpor contemporary experience tells us the fed and all the other central banks will coordinate their efforts to restore economic growth cutting interest rates while accelerating the expansion of money and credit the current generation of investors argues that this policy has always worked in the past at least in the past they have experienced so the valuation basis for financial assets and property should stabilise and improve this brief summary of current thinking in financial markets ignores the fact that a catastrophic tariff cum credit cycle mixture is baking in the economic cake crashing government bond yields reflecting a flight to relative safety are only the start of it if the 1929 32 comparison is valid today we have the additional problems of excessive government debt coupled with consumer debt and hundreds of trillions of over the counter derivatives adding to systemic risk the banking system all but collapsed in the 1930s as banks desperately dumped collateral assets into falling markets this time the debt is not confined to industry a debt contraction will hit consumers directly and threaten domino defaults in otc derivatives as well obviously this cannot be permitted to happen whatever it takes to prevent a debt deflation spiral developing is de facto official policy the only solution central bankers have is to flood the economy with a tsunami of interest free money which will be in addition to the monetary expansion which has continued since the lehman crisis as our tariff and credit cycle mixture bakes in the economic cake infinite monetary inflation will be the response at some point financial markets will wake up to the consequences it could be sudden and relatively soon the chart below of the euro dollar exchange rate warns us that the two most important fiat currencies are about to experience a sudden change in their relationship likely to have far reaching consequences the true purpose behind monetary expansion for the last ten months the euro has been falling in the confines of a triangular pattern it resembles a falling wedge from which a substantial up move for the euro could develop however falling wedges usually last no more than a few months and this one is nearly a year old it could also be a descending triangle but a purist would argue the pattern should be more horizontal that would be sharply bearish for the euro which is easy to imagine given the political economic and systemic issues faced by the eurozone time will tell which interpretation is correct but either way there appears to be imminent currency volatility when the pattern breaks with such a warning we must expect consequences this could be an important clue on timing we shall see besides assessing the immediate implications for financial assets around the world we must also look at the consequences of the increase in monetary inflation about to be inflicted upon us it is a subject of which there is widespread ignorance not just at street level but in the highest levels of finance as well keynes described aptly the extent of this ignorance in his the economic consequences of the peace published one hundred years ago today with the following quote there is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency the process engages all the hidden forces on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose the younger keynes appeared to understand the consequences of inflation four years before the collapse of the german mark in november 1923 the older keynes changed his mind and argued in favour of inflation s powers of economic restoration he became one of the clueless million in his earlier statement this article is for the millions who like the older keynes do not understand the consequences of what will hit them it is for those who do not appreciate the hidden forces of economic destruction driven by the acceleration of monetary debasement which thanks to the developing slump now seems set to be unleashed a government with an exclusive licence to print money will always use it as a source of finance all hyperinflations have had their origin in spendthrift governments with fiat currencies to hand there was a time when every credible economist knew this but now and then someone comes up with a theory that encourages governments to abandon the constraints of sound money and for state sponsored economists to revise their opinions the first modern exponent of fiat currency was georg knapp of the chartalist school in germany who published his state theory of money in 1905 he encouraged bismarck to believe he could finance the newly unified germany s growing status as a military power without raising taxes the consequence was the great war and the continuation of this monetary policy led to the mark s final collapse in 1923 keynes as an occasional economic advisor to the british government took on knapp s mantle in a different way promoting the government s use of money to stimulate the economy early in the business cycle by running a budget deficit initially funded by government debt in a sound money context in other words he promoted the concept of the government being flexible in its finances but balancing its books over the business or trade cycle in seeking a solution to the great depression keynes himself showed that after all he was in the ranks the million who did not fully understood inflation the error in keynes s approach was to believe the cycle was a trade or business cycle when in fact it was a cycle driven by the inflation of the bank credit that he sought to stimulate the solution was not to stimulate the expansion of bank credit but to stop banks from expanding bank credit in the first place and for the government to balance the budget at all times but by encouraging governments to inflate money or have bank credit inflated in its place keynes was effectively promoting a modified version of knapp s disastrous state theory of money the result was that the bastion of sound gold backed money was fatally breached between 1934 when the dollar devalued against gold and 1971 when the bretton woods agreement collapsed us broad money m3 expanded considerably more rapidly than its gold backing going from 5 times to 55 times the issuance of unbacked fiat money was used to fight wars while banks expanded credit primarily to finance business expansion domestically and abroad the collapse of the bretton woods agreement reflected the fact that the dollar was then barely gold backed having become almost totally fiat by coming up with his own limited state theory of money in 1936 keynes along with his fellow inflationists had led the way to casting currencies adrift from their golden anchor since 1971 central banks led by the fed have dealt with the gold issue by dismissing it they adopted a full on state theory of money allowing the quantity of money in circulation to expand without limit gold was no longer available for exchange for dollars at the fed so its price was no longer tied to the dollar following the ending of bretton woods us broad money supply has increased by a further 21 times an average annual compound rate of 6 6 with much of the increase being in the wake of the lehman crisis government economists in the keynesian mould tell you that by managing the quantity of money the economy can be optimised while that opinion might have been honestly held by those duped by keynes it ignores one simple fact in a market economy the money deployed in it is a matter for economic actors not the state whatever keynes s original motivation the state s motive as issuer of state money is to use it as a source of free finance before the lehman crisis inflationary financing was predominantly in the form of the expansion of bank credit but since the lehman crisis it has additionally been by the expansion of base money through the medium of bank credit this new development was quantitative easing justified as an emergency measure to stabilise the economy but it is now becoming a common feature of inflationary government financing government financing by inflationary means has been with us for a long time since 1971 when the bretton woods agreement collapsed net us federal budgets have thrown up a total deficit of 13 738bn which compares neatly with the parallel expansion of broad money of 13 782bn while there is probably an element of coincidence in the closeness of these numbers they carry a clear message about the true purpose of monetary inflation very few people understand it but all the theories and claims about non inflationary financing of government deficits are simply bunkum we now face a potentially devastating combination of american trade protectionism and a credit cycle which is moving america and the world into a severe downturn the effect on government finances can only be guessed at but with the white house s own pre recession forecast of a budget deficit for the current fiscal year of 1 092bn the baseline is not good given the long run relationship established in the previous paragraphs between monetary inflation and the deficit clearly we are in for another acceleration of monetary inflation already monetary policy is to throw as much new money and credit at the economy as it takes to generate recovery as the economy slides interest rates will be returned to zero or even made negative as an inducement to consumers to spend investors to invest and their combined actions to keep the banks afloat it won t work and why not is our next topic the drip feed impoverishment of consumers whatever government economists say about the supposed stimulative effects of price inflation if you debauch the currency you reduce the purchasing power of people s salaries and the value of their savings and the more rapidly you debauch the currency other things being equal the more rapidly you impoverish them this is a process that has been going on for a considerable time it first became apparent when the bretton woods agreement failed in 1971 the accumulated monetary inflation since gold was revalued to 35 in 1934 until 1971 impacted prices over the following decade today the dollar has now lost 97 of its purchasing power measured against gold the people s money since the end of bretton woods while some members of society have prospered by being borrowers and investors in financially leveraged businesses the ordinary worker and consumer has fought a losing battle to maintain a standard of living it should therefore be evident that instead of being a universal benefit monetary inflation creates winners and losers generally savers lose and borrowers win the poor lose and the better off win by gaming the system otherwise the winners are the issuers of new money which are the government through its central bank and the commercial banks who are given a licence by the government to create money in the form of credit commercial banks do this by lending money they do not have and which did not previously exist this money returns to the banking system in the form of new customer deposits to balance its creation the creators of new money are the obvious winners the banks favoured customers traditionally big business also benefit because they get to spend the new money which has been loaned to them before it goes into general circulation the new money then enters circulation indistinguishable from that which already circulates and with a relatively fixed quantity of goods and services being produced in the economy the outcome should be clear prices will rise but they do not rise evenly it depends on where and on what the money is spent as the newly created money progresses in its circulation it drives up prices leaving those yet to receive it disadvantaged they find prices have risen without having seen an increase in their wages and with no compensation for their devalued savings all they know is that prices have risen and they have to make do with what they have or go into debt they are not aware that their unconscious presumption that money is the constant in all their transactions has been undermined by monetary inflation this is why not one in a million has the foggiest idea what has happened to their money relative preferences are of overriding importance to fiat money so far we have commented on what amounts to the quantity theory of money during a monetary inflation the rate at which the general price level increases is also affected by its impact on savings in a country like japan consumers tend to hang on to the extra money rather than spend it increasing their bank and post office deposits prices tend to be more stable for a given rate of monetary inflation as a result the money accumulating in the banks is available to be invested in extra production capacity and product development fortunately for manufacturing businesses in a savings driven economy with a strong currency they can source most of the components of production from abroad thereby keeping a lid on production costs in local currency terms by these means and with a general preference for saving money instead of spending it monetary inflation at the price level is subdued the difference between the savings driven economic model where monetary inflation has less of an effect on prices and the consumer driven model where it feeds directly into consumption reflects different preferences for money relative to goods as long as the public collectively retains some sort of preference for money even if it is a nominal amount of cash the currency will retain some purchasing power it is when the public collectively decides to get rid of all money in preference for goods and services that it becomes worthless in the final analysis it is this relative preference not the quantity in circulation that determines a fiat currency s value on the eve of a deepening recession we now face an acceleration in the pace of monetary inflation as governments seek to fund yawning budget deficits and their central banks try to keep their commercial banks solvent in the consumer driven economies that are most susceptible to price inflation the creation of new money will accelerate the rate of wealth transfer from ordinary people to their governments this is from a level of wealth which has been already badly depleted by monetary inflation over decades and has not much more to give we will face the pig on pork of currency debasement with each new currency unit buying less than the last one in short the dynamics that lead to a final currency collapse are now falling into place our next challenge is to work out how this might happen in a modern context where personal liquidity is vested in credit cards and consumer loans instead of bank balances and physical cash who will liquidate their dollars in the original model of an economy bank deposits were owned by businesses and private individuals reflecting a mixture of profits liquidity and savings this is important because it is the flight out of deposits that will determine the fate of the currency the largest categories of deposit holders will drive the process from being a mainstay of deposit business consumers in america now have very little on deposit as a proportion of the total instead they are often borrowers with credit card debt providing personal liquidity instead of money in the bank and often have just enough credit available to finance their purchases between pay days their influence on relative preferences for money is therefore not as significant as in the past of the total of 12 605bn deposits recorded in the fdic insured us commercial banks and savings institutions at end march we know from us treasury tic data that 4 905bn is owed by the banks to foreign depositors 38 9 of total fdic deposits we also see from the fdic numbers that commercial lenders have deposits of 4 960bn 39 3 the balance of 21 8 is a mixture of deposits on the books of mortgage lenders agricultural lenders and other miscellaneous categories deposits relating to consumer lenders is only 1 4 of the total there is almost certainly some cross over between these categories we can only assume that banks specialising in commercial lending and the other fdic categories seek to attract deposits from related sources in accordance with their expertise and connections this being the case there can be little doubt that it is the relative monetary preferences of foreign and domestic commercial depositors which will take the lead in determining the future purchasing power of the dollar for foreigners the outlook for the exchange rate will be crucial we know from treasury tic data that outflows have already begun coinciding with the sudden slowdown in global trade and if as argued in this article they begin to see a further economic deterioration they will continue to liquidate dollar holdings being surplus to their falling trade requirements their combined dollar holdings including those of foreign governments currently amount to more than america s gdp including investments totalling 18 463bn in addition to the bank deposits mentioned above of 4 905bn therefore we need to keep an eye these flows corporate depositors can be expected to be slower to act than foreigners being primarily interested in accounting profits rather than matters of purchasing power this would change if negative interest rates are imposed by the fed and passed on by the banks to depositors therefore dollar weakness in the foreign exchanges but more particularly against commodities and raw materials at a time of a widespread economic slump is likely to be the first warning of an impending collapse in the dollar s purchasing power this is not current thinking with market commentators believing that indebted foreigners need more cover for their dollar denominated debts the facts from the treasury s tic data speak otherwise and anyway near term debt obligations are routinely hedged by derivatives a flight out of the dollar is therefore much more likely than is generally believed and can be expected to undermine attempts by the fed to maintain control over bond markets for the moment bond prices are rising reflecting increasing signs of recession but it is a phase which will shortly pass the us treasury is anticipating the problem in time attention is bound to refocus towards the funding problems that will arise as a result of falling foreign participation in dollar denominated markets in tic figures we have already seen early evidence of foreign dollar selling threatening to undermine funding of the budget deficit if it continues since the ending of bretton woods with the sole exception between 1998 2001 when there were three budget surpluses in a row there has been a general presumption that foreigners would always fund most if not all of the budget deficit however foreigners now appear to have stopped recycling their trade dollars throwing the us treasury funding burden onto domestic investors who will also have to absorb sales by foreigners the us treasury will desperately need inward portfolio flows to counteract these problems yet portfolio flows are destined to go elsewhere such as into infrastructure development in asia clearly the us treasury must be acutely aware of the problem unless the budding partnership between china and russia is firmly quashed global portfolio money will be sucked into financing their investment plans particularly as they develop their non dollar asia wide currency bloc having been dependent on this money for decades the us treasury will expect a funding crisis in america rapidly materialising this is now the overriding reason behind america s stance in the ongoing financial war with china and russia china and russia are very much aware of these dynamics and are not going to roll over and submit our working assumption must be that over the next few years not only will trade related flows into the dollar reverse as the global recession deepens but china will do its best to starve america of international portfolio flows as well in order to satisfy her own development needs the fed will then have no alternative but to fund much of the government deficit itself through quantitative easing interest rates will return to the zero bound or even be pushed into negative territory to stave off the government s funding crisis lehman will look like a warm up act for what s to come there may be moves to support the dollar from sovereign wealth funds while currency swaps between the leading central banks could be used to stabilise currencies perhaps a new plan involving sdrs will be hatched a global reset might be claimed to be taking place but it will not change outcomes the reality is print print print monetary inflation in the world s reserve currency can only accelerate because of an escalating budget deficit and the need to support banks which would otherwise fail with a second leap in the inflation rate of the fiat reserve currency and with sales of us treasuries by foreign sellers to absorb the dollar will lose credibility first abroad and then domestically prices of goods and services will rise in domestic dollars and any other fiat currency tied to the dollar despite the slump in demand from a deepening recession if you still think all the change in prices comes from the goods side in a transaction you will be flummoxed at how it is possible for prices to rise in a slump the explanation is the purchasing power of your fiat dollars euros whatever is falling more rapidly than the deflating values of goods this could happen quickly once the slide begins central banks have been closing loopholes in the banking system leaving depositors in aggregate trapped the amount of physical cash they can withdraw from their accounts is limited today and in real terms will be worth even less in the future the only escape for a depositor is to buy things anything gold bitcoin even but with a tide of depositors moving in the same direction the price a seller will accept will rise very quickly because sellers equally will be reluctant to hold currency comprehend all this and you will understand how the inflationary process engages all the hidden forces on the side of destruction there have been many changes in the last hundred years since keynes wrote the economic consequences of the peace but the human desire for satisfaction security and an erroneous belief in the honest motives of government have generally remained the same it never occurs to anyone that the state routinely robs them of the value of their wages and savings by the simple expedient of issuing money out of thin air ignorance of monetary affairs and of the surreptitious inflation of the currency remains a mystery to as many people today as it did then hopefully this will no longer include readers of this article for broad money m3 see for budget balances see 42 22 1335 consumers also have auto loans student debt and

systemic factor basel 3 rule permitting gold in account ratios all three forces are positive in releasing gold from the corrupt clutches of the anglo american banker organization the eastern hemisphere has a planned coordinated and effective strategy to abandon the usdollar and to adopt the gold standard it has happened first in the trade payment form actually more like a global blossoming process more progress can be inferred in its early stages in the last ten years since the lehman brothers failure all systems have undergone the same reckless treatment that the mortgage bonds endured slowly the realization is coming to the fore stated by a few astute analysts in the last decade the us uk bank management wing of the cabal has created the ustreasury bond as the global subprime bond this is the result of magnificent persistent qe abuse hidden derivative activity to produce false bond demand foreign dumping of usgovt debt securities astonishing debt explosion pilferage of foreign bond holdings and wickedly false aaa debt rating it is reported that the ustbond is the favorite asset used to finance the belt road initiative projects something like 2 5 trillion has been spent toward the nearly 9 trillion in mou commitment for the vast bri project slate this has occurred after the ustbond was the primary asset used to build the siberian oil pipeline to serve chinese demand the irony of such indirect exchange spent ustbonds as cash by third parties is extremely important yet nowhere repeated in the tilted western financial press all this has occurred while the us press calls the bri projects frivolous but motivated to trap the member states in participation such pathetically shallow propaganda equal in pathology as the claim that the useconomy is robust all measures is flashing red worse than seen in 2006 2007 ustbond as global subprime bond the ustreasury bond is the global subprime bond and the outcome will be a much bigger bond market crisis than in 2008 it is often called the everything bond bubble the so called financial stimulus has been actually hyper monetary inflation which has destroyed the bond market even if having prevented a usgovt debt default back in 2012 legitimate bond investors have vanished years ago there are no legitimate ustreasury buyers outside the us foreign vassal states on many different platforms the usdollar is being rejected including the crude oil market next comes its rejection in the commodities market by this is meant that the oil and commodity trade is much less dominated by the usd in trade payment such is motive to keep the wrecked bankrupted shale sector alive so as to provide some added usd based oil trade a perfect storm is hitting the diverse bond market witness a diverse set of very serious if not calamitous warning signals many noticed but not well as a collection to signal imminent financial crisis in the jackass opinion the systemic lehman crisis has begun witness the many warning signals enormous usgovt debt heading for over 1 2 trillion this fiscal year a gigantic mass of bbb rated corporate bonds now measured at 3 3 trillion a badly inverted ustreasury yield curve with all points upside down heavy reliance upon derivative machinery to produce fake bond demand strained primary bond dealers who cannot find investors dwindling usfed cash reserves which worsen each month anomalies with respect to interest on excess reserves an official fed funds rate above many bond yields along the maturity spectrum the storm will grow much more intense as the us federal reserve is forced to cut interest rates doing so will render great harm to the money market which has almost no eyes upon it these days the result will be more bond dumping both by us domestic funds and foreign official entities the pressure put upon the derivative machinery will be fierce normally bigger debt results in higher bond yields to attract the required capital but the united states govt operates in reverse trying to conjure up a bond rally with false narratives fake demand and utter horse puckey bonds wrapped on fancy ink and paper to sell it will not work this time since the new consensus is that the usgovt debt will never be repaid the jackass forecast of a debt default made first in 2009 is coming into view at last but the biggest effect of the cut rates in combination with a return to high volume qe monetary policy reverse of tightening will be felt in the gold price it will finally break north of the 1450 resistance level and seek higher level targets quickly already major billionaire investors are talking about a big important bull move in gold finally gold standard coming into view the gold standard is step by step coming into view consider it arriving on a four legged table each with strong legs given the steadfast vicious defense of the king dollar and its hegemon court all transformations and transitions must be gradual subtle and deep during the last two years the jackass has regularly made the claim that the gold standard would see it initial implementation in the trade payment form this has turned out to be the case gold trade note commercial global trade payment the suspicions are ripe and rabid that china is using the gold trade note gtnote in their crude oil purchases nothing can be proved all done surreptitiously with large scale payments made like with the saudis and other gulf oil monarchies such as qatar and oman significant rmb currency has shown up on the aramco balance sheet in recent months in fact the volume exceeds the british pound and japanese yen ledger items together the rmb item was not present a year ago it would make sense that china also uses the gold trade note with oil purchases from iran these two nations are expanding their barter facilities like with import export bank functions and might underpin a growing volume with the gtnote itself their motive would be to advance the gold standard indirectly in the king dollar s face the entire belt road initiative aka one belt one road is to conduct trade outside the usdollar basel 3 rule change gold as countable asset in ratios the rule change has opened the gates the major central banks and the secondary central banks are deploying closely aligned financial firms to go out and buy gold bullion while selling ustreaurys this is all being done in secrecy and kept off the balance sheet in the meantime the same dutiful agents of the banker cabal decry denigrate and deny the value of gold they are grand hypocrites these many central banks are collecting gold for the big rise in its price which might tend to save their fat hind parts during the crisis that builds their fx paper will be shredded while their newly placed gold will enjoy a fast rise on the balance sheets what they say is usually 180 degrees opposite for what they actually do they want the public to be on the opposite side of their movements always panda bond issuance gold backed sovereign bonds a bond priced in chinese rmb terms defines a panda bond they typically are for sovereign debt issuance with some high profile corporate bonds at times this is the newest of the four legs to the gold standard implementation the astute analyst can infer a gold role in these panda bonds which heretofore has not been admitted this golden leg is analyzed in the june hat trick letter to be posted very soon this month regional gold currency usage decentralization we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us when malaysian prime minister mahathir announced the cooperative venture to use a regional gold currency in order to settle bilateral trade obligations a few weeks ago he put his life at risk the very same initiative announced by japan was quickly followed by the fukushima attack called an accident in the west but called an attack all through the east expect the entire pacific rim to climb aboard the regional gold currency for settlement of trade payments which has yet to take shape or to be named the jackass expects malaysia to be joined by indonesia the philippines singapore thailand even taiwan possibly hong kong the key to this regional instrument for trade payment will be the absent participation of china they might direct the movement from behind the curtain dual universe the next stage for global finance will incorporate regional structures and platforms the entire community of nations is making major adjustments as preliminary preparation to the global reset in order to minimize the shock disruption and potential chaos expect regional themes to dominate as the dual universe comes into form the east will prefer to trade in chinese rmb terms and often in euro terms the west will prefer to conduct trade in usd terms but also british pounds in trace amounts within the old colonies a dichotomy has formed with great geopolitical division amidst hostility and trade friction in addition to direct threats and slapped sanctions the entire usfed qe initiative coupled with unbridled trillion usgovt debts has fostered a rebellion during a long period of time marred by visible bond fraud the rest of the globe is in active revolt whose movement gains momentum each month the transition period will involve the two dominant currencies at work the usd and rmb the fully implemented gold standard will require still more time more cooking the usdollar will not go away quickly or easily it is well rooted in trade payments systems in credit systems in banking systems in derivative contracts and more the entire langley seven silos of corrupt illegal enterprises narcotics weapons human trafficking human organs are based in the usdollar with gargantuan savings accounts and business investments they will not go away anytime soon which dictates an interim period the dual universe has been born without much fanfare as an evolution taking form during tremendous tensions and conflict the chinese rmb is to be the designated caretaker used for ushering in the gold standard the united states must adapt to the gold trade note in usage it must contend with shortages and rising prices following import supply interruptions weather related food supply shortages and trade tariffs costs are the newest ugly wrinkles the us must launch a competing gold backed currency it must live with the reality of the lost global currency reserve and shared mantle of global leadership it must share global power while losing the exceptional status and its license for fomenting terrorism it must ward off isolation it must reindustrialize it must pay down the 22 trillion debt it must source gold for the new currency it must face the risk of a stark reality in the new scheiss dollar a third world conception provided the usgovt resorts to its usual fraudulent finances my full expectation is that the usgovt will launch at a very late stage a fully fraudulent gold backed dollar it will be fortified by fake gold bars tungsten with gold clad and by claimed deep storage gold it will be supported by falsified auditing reports supported by deadly threats after a year or more the global challenge will be fierce for its null integrity and voided legitimacy the usgovt has proved since september 2001 that it will execute all the corrupt decisions make all the wrong steps and be forced to take proper steps only at the point of a howitzer gun or at the creditor table during a restructured bankruptcy in fact the bankruptcy of the usgovt corporation is the new poorly kept

platforms the usdollar is being rejected including the crude oil market next comes its rejection in the commodities market by this is meant that the oil and commodity trade is much less dominated by the usd in trade payment such is motive to keep the wrecked bankrupted shale sector alive so as to provide some added usd based oil trade a perfect storm is hitting the diverse bond market witness a diverse set of very serious if not calamitous warning signals many noticed but not well as a collection to signal imminent financial crisis in the jackass opinion the systemic lehman crisis has begun witness the many warning signals enormous usgovt debt heading for over 1 2 trillion this fiscal year a gigantic mass of bbb rated corporate bonds now measured at 3 3 trillion a badly inverted ustreasury yield curve with all points upside down heavy reliance upon derivative machinery to produce fake bond demand strained primary bond dealers who cannot find investors dwindling usfed cash reserves which worsen each month anomalies with respect to interest on excess reserves an official fed funds rate above many bond yields along the maturity spectrum the storm will grow much more intense as the us federal reserve is forced to cut interest rates doing so will render great harm to the money market which has almost no eyes upon it these days the result will be more bond dumping both by us domestic funds and foreign official entities the pressure put upon the derivative machinery will be fierce normally bigger debt results in higher bond yields to attract the required capital but the united states govt operates in reverse trying to conjure up a bond rally with false narratives fake demand and utter horse puckey bonds wrapped on fancy ink and paper to sell it will not work this time since the new consensus is that the usgovt debt will never be repaid the jackass forecast of a debt default made first in 2009 is coming into view at last but the biggest effect of the cut rates in combination with a return to high volume qe monetary policy reverse of tightening will be felt in the gold price it will finally break north of the 1450 resistance level and seek higher level targets quickly already major billionaire investors are talking about a big important bull move in gold finally gold standard coming into view the gold standard is step by step coming into view consider it arriving on a four legged table each with strong legs given the steadfast vicious defense of the king dollar and its hegemon court all transformations and transitions must be gradual subtle and deep during the last two years the jackass has regularly made the claim that the gold standard would see it initial implementation in the trade payment form this has turned out to be the case gold trade note commercial global trade payment the suspicions are ripe and rabid that china is using the gold trade note gtnote in their crude oil purchases nothing can be proved all done surreptitiously with large scale payments made like with the saudis and other gulf oil monarchies such as qatar and oman significant rmb currency has shown up on the aramco balance sheet in recent months in fact the volume exceeds the british pound and japanese yen ledger items together the rmb item was not present a year ago it would make sense that china also uses the gold trade note with oil purchases from iran these two nations are expanding their barter facilities like with import export bank functions and might underpin a growing volume with the gtnote itself their motive would be to advance the gold standard indirectly in the king dollar s face the entire belt road initiative aka one belt one road is to conduct trade outside the usdollar basel 3 rule change gold as countable asset in ratios the rule change has opened the gates the major central banks and the secondary central banks are deploying closely aligned financial firms to go out and buy gold bullion while selling ustreaurys this is all being done in secrecy and kept off the balance sheet in the meantime the same dutiful agents of the banker cabal decry denigrate and deny the value of gold they are grand hypocrites these many central banks are collecting gold for the big rise in its price which might tend to save their fat hind parts during the crisis that builds their fx paper will be shredded while their newly placed gold will enjoy a fast rise on the balance sheets what they say is usually 180 degrees opposite for what they actually do they want the public to be on the opposite side of their movements always panda bond issuance gold backed sovereign bonds a bond priced in chinese rmb terms defines a panda bond they typically are for sovereign debt issuance with some high profile corporate bonds at times this is the newest of the four legs to the gold standard implementation the astute analyst can infer a gold role in these panda bonds which heretofore has not been admitted this golden leg is analyzed in the june hat trick letter to be posted very soon this month regional gold currency usage decentralization when malaysian prime minister mahathir announced the cooperative venture to use a regional gold currency in order to settle bilateral trade obligations a few weeks ago he put his life at risk the very same initiative announced by japan was quickly followed by the fukushima attack called an accident in the west but called an attack all through the east expect the entire pacific rim to climb aboard the regional gold currency for settlement of trade payments which has yet to take shape or to be named the jackass expects malaysia to be joined by indonesia the philippines singapore thailand even taiwan possibly hong kong the key to this regional instrument for trade payment will be the absent participation of china they might direct the movement from behind the curtain dual universe the next stage for global finance will incorporate regional structures and platforms the entire community of nations is making major adjustments as preliminary preparation to the global reset in order to minimize the shock disruption and potential chaos expect regional themes to dominate as the dual universe comes into form the east will prefer to trade in chinese rmb terms and often in euro terms the west will prefer to conduct trade in usd terms but also british pounds in trace amounts within the old colonies a dichotomy has formed with great geopolitical division amidst hostility and trade friction in addition to direct threats and slapped sanctions the entire usfed qe initiative coupled with unbridled trillion usgovt debts has fostered a rebellion during a long period of time marred by visible bond fraud the rest of the globe is in active revolt whose movement gains momentum each month the transition period will involve the two dominant currencies at work the usd and rmb the fully implemented gold standard will require still more time more cooking the usdollar will not go away quickly or easily it is well rooted in trade payments systems in credit systems in banking systems in derivative contracts and more the entire langley seven silos of corrupt illegal enterprises narcotics weapons human trafficking human organs are based in the usdollar with gargantuan savings accounts and business investments they will not go away anytime soon which dictates an interim period the dual universe has been born without much fanfare as an evolution taking form during tremendous tensions and conflict the chinese rmb is to be the designated caretaker used for ushering in the gold standard the united states must adapt to the gold trade note in usage it must contend with shortages and rising prices following import supply interruptions weather related food supply shortages and trade tariffs costs are the newest ugly wrinkles the us must launch a competing gold backed currency it must live with the reality of the lost global currency reserve and shared mantle of global leadership it must share global power while losing the exceptional status and its license for fomenting terrorism it must ward off isolation it must reindustrialize it must pay down the 22 trillion debt it must source gold for the new currency it must face the risk of a stark reality in the new scheiss dollar a third world conception provided the usgovt resorts to its usual fraudulent finances my full expectation is that the usgovt will launch at a very late stage a fully fraudulent gold backed dollar it will be fortified by fake gold bars tungsten with gold clad and by claimed deep storage gold it will be supported by falsified auditing reports supported by deadly threats after a year or more the global challenge will be fierce for its null integrity and voided legitimacy the usgovt has proved since september 2001 that it will execute all the corrupt decisions make all the wrong steps and be forced to take proper steps only at the point of a howitzer gun or at the creditor table during a restructured bankruptcy in fact the bankruptcy of the usgovt corporation is the new poorly kept secret hat trick letter profits in the current crisis jim willie s

markets are bracing for updates on tactical trade war positioning and central bank rate decisions the dollar s recent rally stemmed on better than expected economic data that could convince fed officials that the economy is healthy enough and might not require an immediate rate cut us stocks are struggling resuming the recent rebound until we see further progress on the trade front and a confirmation that the fed will deliver a rate cut on monday we will see if china is dumping us treasuries and public hearings begin in washington on president trump s proposed tariffs on 300 billion more in chinese goods the focus for the trading week will fall on the upcoming rate decisions from the fed boj and boe which should further cement easing money flowing through financial markets the fed will meet on wednesday and is expected to pave the way for july rate cut by downgrading their forecasts and removing their patient stance the boj is not expected to announce anything new but possibly highlight the growing of the risks to the downside on both their growth and inflation forecasts the boe is expected to remain on hold until further clarity is delivered on brexit the outlook for the uk economy is worsening and rate hike expectations have been dwindling since february fomc meeting powell to setup july rate cut china s treasury holding update and hearings on trump s proposed tariffs crude volatility on high alert as geopolitical risks remain and on opec meeting uncertainty fed it appears bond markets got their way after sending the yield on us 10 year treasury down from just below 2 60 all the way down towards 2 00 the fed appears ready to capitulate on cutting rates with inflation remaining muted and growth vulnerable due to the trade war the fed is expected appears set to signal to markets that a rate cut is coming at the july meeting fed fund futures see a 21 3 chance that rates will be cut at the june 19th meeting while the july 31st meeting has an 84 3 expectation for a rate cut the fed is widely expected to tweak their stance on being patient which would signal they are ready to ease historically the dollar weakness is strongest at the beginning of an easing cycle and the swiss franc has been the strongest beneficiary if we see the fed signal a one and done approach to easing we however could see limited dollar weakness the fed owes the market a rate cut to fix the policy mistake at the end of last year and they should keep the door open for further easing to deliver a soft landing for the us economy gbp the bank of england is expected to keep rates steady as policymakers will unlikely be able to deliver any clear messages on future policy until we have brexit clarity while the recent banter has been calling for rate hikes boe officials will struggle to deliver a rate hike as economic growth has softened and despite inflation running above target brexit remains the key driver for the british pound and expectations are growing for boris johnson to win the tory leadership johnson had a strong showing at the first round of conservative party leadership vote while johnson has begun downplaying a hard brexit that risk will grow if he wins the top spot and that should cap any sustained rebounds with cable oil crude prices are expected to remain volatile as tensions remain high in the middle east and as opec scrambles to coordinate their next meetings to solidify a continuation of production cuts crude remains around bear market territory as global growth concerns from recent escalations in the trade war are flipping the demand argument for higher prices on its head rising crude inventories have not done any favors for the supply argument as well next week should see opec and allies finally agree on when they will meet russia was hoping to push the meeting back from the scheduled ministerial meeting from june 26th in to early july iran did not want to change any of the dates with opec meeting on the june 25th and the next day being the opec and allies meeting once the oil producing countries agree upon when to meet the complicated task in reorganizing production cuts will be difficult to appease both the russians and iranians a failure however in continuing the production cuts could prove catastrophic for crude and could warrant brent and wti falling below the 60 and 50 a barrel levels respectively gold gold bulls made their return in june after initially struggling to benefit from strong risk aversion flows in april softer economic data globally and expectations the markets will see most of the advanced economies provide easy money have helped the yellow metal gain some traction the fed s fomc meeting should cement a july cut and that could provide the beginnings of a dollar reversal which could be bullish for gold deflationary conditions worldwide rising tensions in the middle east and trade uncertainty are likely to support gold s rally next week both the boj and fed will update markets on their outlooks for inflation and the overall risks to their respective economies dovish messages are widely expected from both central banks bitcoin facebook is expected to announce libra a new cryptocurrency that has key partnerships with visa mastercard paypal and uber mainstream commerce is important for the success with digital currencies and the social media giant s

the official counterfeiter from 2007 in a recent report the ultimate subprime borrower uncle sam i made this observation the easy money policy of greenspan s federal reserve beginning in the summer of 2000 lured in the suckers creditors and borrowers the fed sent a false signal to the credit markets i do not want readers to get the impression that the federal reserve under alan greenspan was unique in this regard the primary function of all central banks is to send false signals to borrowers and creditors all the time their secondary function is to bail out large commercial banks that suffer bank runs and even face bankruptcy bank rupture bank runs are the consequence of commercial banks implementation of the central bank s policy of deceiving borrowers and creditors this is not taught in money and banking textbooks with one exception murray rothbard s 1983 book the mystery of banking as far as i know no college or university professor ever assigned this book it is much too controversial it explains in detail why central banking rests on the dual assumption that 1 theft through monetary inflation is morally neutral and 2 is often i e all the time the best monetary policy keynesianism monetarism and supply side economics all rest on this dual assumption they debate only on which rate of theft is wise at any time you can download the book for free here setting the rate of interest in a free market society the rate of interest is set by means of a competitive capital market in which each individual decides to lend borrow or stay out of the credit markets his decision depends on his subjective assessment of how valuable future income is to him some people are highly future oriented ludwig von mises called this outlook low time preference other people are highly present oriented mises called this outlook high time preference most people are somewhere in between when a person has low time preference and if he seeks future income he is willing to lend his capital money at a low interest rate the borrower does not have to offer him a high rate of return to persuade him to forfeit the use of his wealth for a specified period of time in contrast is the high time preference individual he wants the use of his money now so that he can buy consumer goods and services he wants gratification maybe not instantly but soon very soon to persuade him to forfeit the use of his money a borrower must offer him a very high interest rate the free market allows high time preference people mid time preference people and low time preference people to come together and make offers and counter offers to borrow or lend in other words they make bids the capital markets are gigantic auctions for capital through these objective bids the subjective time preferences of acting individuals produce specific rates of interest in specific capital markets a rate of interest is at bottom the price of obtaining capital for a specific period of time in a specific risk market it is governed by the subjective time preferences of capital owners and borrowers borrowers possess a crucial capital asset their likelihood of repayment this is determined objectively by such factors as their net income net worth existing debts and record of past payments modern credit markets have profit seeking credit rating services that trace individuals past payment performance they assign an objective number to each individual lending institutions use this number to assess individual credit risk this is another way of saying that borrowers can capitalize their moral commitment to repay an objectively good credit rating reflects a morally good commitment to repay the psalmist wrote 3 000 years ago the wicked borroweth and payeth not again psalm 37 21a banks have long functioned as brokers in the loan markets lenders hire bankers to screen candidates for loans borrowers go to bankers to obtain money deposited by lenders this is a legitimate economic function of banks they capitalize on their specialized information of the credit markets including borrowers likelihood of non payment a rate of interest is ultimately a product of subjective assessments of the relevant discount for time and objective assessments of credit risk deception for fun profit and power any tampering with any rate of interest by a government agency or a government licensed private profit seeking agency constitutes a deliberate attempt to use legalized coercion to deceive lenders and borrowers about the prevailing subjective discounts for time and the objective credit risk of borrowers central banks have been licensed by governments and given monopoly control over domestic banking politicians assume that central bankers will deceive the public in government approved ways this assumption is usually correct occasionally this assumption is incorrect these occasional departures are called respectively mass inflation and recession depression first a central bank begins its process of deception by hiring economists to decide which economic theory to apply to statistical information this theory shapes which information is collected second a central bank hires specialists to collect statistical information on the overall economy sometimes the government supplies this information often this information must be supplied to the government by private individuals or businesses on threat of negative sanctions for refusing to supply it third other central bank economists interpret the significance for the overall economy of the collected information they pick and choose in terms of the prevailing economic theory which includes a theory of the boom bust cycle fourth a different group of economists decides whether to buy sell or hold government debt certificates in order to change the prevailing interest rates or keep them the same a central bank can buy long term government debt to lower the capital markets long term rate of interest bonds and mortgages rates will then fall or it can buy short term debt to influence the overnight rate of interest that commercial banks lend to each other rates will then fall it can also sell debt certificates in order to produce the reverse effects central banks rarely do this for more than a few weeks the underlying presuppositions of central bank deception are these 1 the free market is not a reliable agency to allocate capital 2 central bankers have both a legal right and a moral obligation to alter the rate of interest 3 an economic boom expansion of the division of labor is preferable to whatever conditions the free market would otherwise impose 4 an economic bust contraction of the division of labor is to be avoided because a it may produce bank runs and b incumbent politicians who officially have the authority to set central bank policy or even revoke its grant of monopoly fear the political results of an economic bust 5 it is preferable to be a central banker whose career is protected by the government than to be a commercial banker or an economist who competes in an unhampered market over time 5 replaces 1 which replaces 2 etc how much time this is an empirical question my guess is about three weeks consequences of this deception when central banks buy any asset they create money to buy it the seller of the debt certificate then spends the newly created money the seller of the debt certificate is like an auctioneer he likes lots of people to show up at his auction the seller of a promise to pay future money wants to pay a low rate of interest the more lenders who show up at the auction each bidding against the other the better it is for the borrower sellers keep saying i ll accept a lower rate the borrower thinks how much lower when no lenders in the debt market have counterfeited money to buy the debt there will be no long term price inflation under such conditions rates do not fall as a result of counterfeit money being used to buy the debt certificates every lender forfeits the use of his money during the period of the debt the borrower spends this money but the lender would also have spent it no new purchasing power comes into the market a central bank is the government s officially licensed counterfeiter so when a central bank creates new money to buy debt there is no offsetting reduction of spending as would otherwise be the case with a non counterfeiting lender counterfeiting is illegal because governments central banks and commercial banks want no competition what they are really protecting is their government protected trademark if anyone could create money this would destroy the purchasing power of money i once saw a cartoon of a counterfeiter who had a graph on the wall the line sloping downward and to the right was value of money the line sloping upward and to the right price of paper the upward line had just intersected the downward line the counterfeiter yells stop the presses in a purely government run counterfeiting operation the insulated bureaucrats may not stop the presses this early hence we had the great mass inflations in history such as germany 1919 23 and hungary 1945 48 when central banks issue counterfeited new money governments spend this money the new money multiplies through the fractionally reserved commercial banking system in this sense the central bank s holdings of government debt serve as the legal monetary base of the commercial banking system when the central bank increases the monetary base commercial banks increase their loans when the central bank sells assets commercial banks must decrease their loans in the early stages of the boom the central bank s purchases of government debt lower the rate of interest meaning short term rates unless the central bank buys bonds lower rates send a signal to borrowers there is more capital available but there isn t there is merely more money at a lower price a greater quantity is demanded the level of debt rises more business projects get started if the borrowers are consumers more consumer purchases take place happy days are here again but then prices begin to rise or else they don t fall as they otherwise would have why because the newly counterfeited funds that were lent to borrowers and immediately spent into circulation added to the money supply on a free market funds lent could not be spent by the lenders to buy anything as prices rise the boom accelerates buyers think i had better buy now before prices rise further sellers think i had better hold onto my property prices are rising so prices continue to rise but at some point they rise so high that new buyers cannot afford to buy any more then like an ocean liner that has hit an iceberg the economy begins to slow then it sinks capital that had been invested in booming sectors of the economy is revealed to have been invested in items that consumers are no longer willing to buy a financial bubble is always fiat money created it is created by interest rates that are set below what would have prevailed on a free market when it pops and investors lose money they rarely blame the official counterfeiters the central bank and the commercial banks florida follies florida was a bubble real estate market for five years it began reversing in 2006 here is a recent report published in florida today march 15 in brevard county it s a buyer s and renter s market just ask sharon montano 44 an assembler at drs the palm bay resident lived with her three teenaged sons in a three bedroom 745 a month unit at country garden apartments until six weeks ago when she decided to rent a four bedroom home for 945 a month the boys needed a backyard they couldn t play on the grass there the kitchen in the apartment was really small and i hated cooking she said there are so many restrictions in an apartment and so much comfort in a house although he wishes he didn t ken myers owns 15 rental homes along the central coast of florida including five in brevard county like many home flippers people who build or buy homes improve them if need be and then sell them for a profit myers made money for three or four years until the new home market softened about a year ago i was trapped into renting he said to compete in this market myers has to keep rents low negotiate for less than his monthly costs and even offer the first month free i ve got mortgages for 2 700 a month and i m renting a 3 000 square foot house for 1 200 i m upside down myers said he plans to stick it out until the housing market reverses he thinks that will be soon florida owners thought so in 1926 too this situation has taken place because of federal reserve policy as well as central bank policy in japan and china which also have bought u s government debt they created fiat money bought dollars and bought t bills rates fell from mid 2000 to mid 2003 now they have risen those who got sucked in are finding that the bubble mentality has begun to fade conclusion there are no free lunches there is no free money at some point a rational counterfeiter shouts stop the presses bernanke s fed dramatically slowed the presses beginning in february 2006 the monetary base from march 15 2006 to march 14 2007 was up by 1 8 there are winners in the boom phase who become losers in the bust phase the bust phase is beginning the losers will soon feel a great deal of pain __________________ published on march 21 2007 the original is here

purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they also are an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it s scored positively if it s within the top 1 3 of that range negative in the bottom 1 3 and neutral in between where it s not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the yoy change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it s less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there s an additional rule data is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it s scored neutral if it is moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high recap of monthly reports may reports included positive industrial production and real retail sales an uptick in present consumer sentiment and a downtick in future expectations and small increases in both producer and consumer prices total business sales in april decreased while inventories increased the jolts report showed very positive hires and quits but layoffs increased and job openings continued to fade long leading indicators interest rates and credit spreads rates baa corporate bond index 4 52 down 04 w w 1 year range 4 15 5 29 10

few months they made repeated new three month and several all time highs and thus their rating returned to positive although it is certainly interesting that stocks have failed to make a truly significant new high in the past 16 months despite lots of intraday volatility this week the end result was mildly positive regional fed new orders indexes indicates report this week no reports this

volatile than the ism manufacturing index but usually correctly forecasts its month over month direction it was very positive for most of last year since last summer it gradually cooled to weakly positive for five weeks it alternated between neutral and weakly positive then in april turned solidly positive this month it slipped back but remains positive employment metrics initial jobless claims 222 000 up 4 000 four week average 217 750 up 2 750 initial claims had generally been very positive in 2017 and 2018 in november they briefly spiked and did so again at the end of january the worst of which was probably connected to the government shutdown they made new 49 year lows in the three weeks just before easter probably due to residual seasonality the overall trend still appears to be weakly positive temporary staffing index from the american staffing association unchanged at 94 w w down 2 6 yoy this index was positive with a few exceptions all during 2017 it was negative for over a month at the beginning of 2018 but returned to a positive for most of the rest of the year in the last five months it has gradually declined turning neutral in january and then negative and

positive until autumn when it weakened precipitously probably due to tariffs it rebounded strongly in january but since then it has turned neutral or negative it s now at its worst yoy levels yet suggesting that the trade war with china is having a major impact rail traffic in the western us is likely also impacted by the widening of the panama canal which has allowed ships to bypass west coast ports and proceed directly to gulf and east cost ports harpex made multi year lows in early 2017 and after oscillating improved to new multi year highs earlier in 2018 but recently enough to rate negative in the past month it has rebounded enough to be neutral bdi traced a similar trajectory and made three year highs near the end of 2017 and at mid year 2018 hit mult iyear highs since then it declined all the way to negative but has improved enough again to rate neutral i m wary of reading too much into price indexes like this since they are heavily influenced by supply as in a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade as well as demand steel production from the american iron and steel institute down 0 8 w w up 3 3 yoy steel production was generally positive in 2017 it turned negative in january and early february of 2018 but with the exception of three weeks recently has been positive since then recently the yoy comparison abruptly declined to less than 1 2 of it recent range over 10 yoy and was neutral and has been varying between neutral and positive since for the past two weeks it has been neutral summary and conclusion among long leading indicators purchase mortgage applications mortgage rates the chicago fed adjusted financial conditions index and leverage subindex real estate loans real m1 and real m2 and mortgage refinancing are positives the yield curve corporate bonds and treasuries are neutral corporate profits are negative among the short leading indicators stock prices the chicago national conditions index gas and oil prices initial claims and the regional fed new orders indexes are positives one measure of the us dollar is neutral the second measure of the us dollar the general commodity index the spread between corporate and treasury bonds industrial metals gas usage and temporary staffing are negative among the coincident indicators redbook consumer spending tax withholding and the ted spread are positive harpex the bdi retail economist consumer spending and steel are neutral rail and libor are negative between lower interest rates and improving real money supply the overall long term forecast has turned even more positive the short term forecast however remains negative and the nowcast has declined form weakly positive to neutral as i have pointed out before these metrics are good at forecasting the economy if left to its own devices at present however it s far from being left to its own devices in particular because of chaotic trade and tariff policies even if one agrees with the trade objectives and the use of tariffs toward those objectives however the chaotic nature of their deployment is asymmetrically negative as no one can be sure that even a fully agreed to trade deal can survive beyond the next tweet thus the near term forecast is not better than and may well be worse than indicated by these indicators

menafn dailyfx fed talking points dollar enjoyed a key rally that averted a true breakdown with help of retail sales data which beat back recession fears trade wars remain a top concern and candidate for market volatility as china s economy slows and broadcom reports a 2bln revenue hit the fed s wednesday rate decision is top event risk carrying far more responsibility for market stability than it should do you trade on fundamental themes or event risk see whatlive events we will cover on dailyfxahead uch as the us sentiment live data event as well as our regular webinar series meant to help you hone your trading a timely dollar rally that taps into growth relief for the favored measures of risk appetite this past week offered an unmistakable loss of traction in an otherwise encouraging recovery effort mounted at the start of june while most of the speculative benchmarks were slow to follow from more deelpy discounted levels compounded over the past year the dow ands p 500rode the wave early and attempted to extend the run to record highs with the loss of momentum this past week there is little chance enthusiasm will simply sweep over the market once again our fate is now in the hands of high level themes some of which that aren t tracked out for definitive updates like trade wars and others such asmonetary policy which are focused on a single overriding event while there is considerable turbulence to be found in geopolitical uncertainties trade wars and the trajectory of economic activity the fed rate decision on wednesday is the unmistakable beacon of potential in the week ahead while a key event for the dollar the implications for growth and need to hold back the pressure in trade wars will make for an event with far more reach chart ofdow jones industrial averagewith 200 day moving average daily as we closed out this past week there was a sense of calm before the storm for many of the traditional risk assets the exception was the us dollar and those assets that carry a direct inference to its pricing capacity while the greenback was just as distracted by the event risk in the week ahead the anxiety of anticipation wound the market up enough that a fundamental cross current could trigger a move that essentially fell into the category of following the path of least resistance thedxyopened the trading week at cusp of reversal on a 12 month rising trendline and just above the 200 day moving average while theeurusdhad technically made its break above channel resistance though it too was still yielding to its own 200 day moving average with a high bar to mounting true conviction it was natural for the currency to flag similar to how the dow had yet that tempered lean turned into outright recovery through friday chart of dxy dollar index with 200 day moving average daily the spark on friday to pull the dollar back comfortably into its well worn range were a few coinciding cues that spoke to relief to a slowly but consistently eroding outlook for growth through week s end the us may retail sales perked up confidence significantly when it was reported that purchases rose 0 5 percent for the month both with and without autos but the real surprise was the revision higher for april what was previously registered as a 0 2 percent contraction a reading that translated into fears that the us economy was visibly stalling as revised up to 0 3 percent expansion that offered enough optimism to offset the concern around the university of michigan s consumer confidence survey printing a slide 97 9 following 100 0 though the jump in the atlanta fed 2q gdp forecast 2 1 versus 1 4 percent and new york fed s forecast 1 4 versus 1 0 percent certainly helped the cause now in the middle of its range the price of conviction and technical progress is once again substantially higher chart of eurusd with 100 and 200 day moving average and daily change daily the market is putting far too much hope on the federal reserve looking out over the new trading week there is good reason to suspect that we will face all of the major themes that we have been dealing with regularly as of late despite what the us sales figures and regional fed gdp assessments may have offered this past week there is serious restraint on the outlook for growth in the global economy and its largest individual member the most direct measure of economic tempo ahead is friday s run of june pmis japan australia eurozone and the us the most often cited top threat to economic activity moving forward trade wars will be just as prominent in the rounds of speculation this past week president trump increased confusion over the state of negotiations with china and mexico in turn 600 plus companies from retail technology and other key sectors signed a letter to the white house calling on administration to resovle the trade war as the pain was starting to set in for the us economy to reinforce that point on friday broadcom cut its revenue outlook by 2 billion due to geopolitical uncertainties and the loss of business by its largest customer huawei which was infamously banned last month chart of broadcom stock and opening gaps daily the global economy is unmistakably slowing external pressures from protectionism are increasing and competitive policies are starting to raise the specter of serious volatility investor economist and president are increasingly turning to the federal reserve to put out the fires unfortunately it is impossible to live up to all of the demands wednesday sfomc federal open market committee decision is the most appropriate opportunity to offer a critical update on the intention for support because the markets both need the reassurance and this will be one of the quarterly events in which the group will announce rates chairman powell will offer insight and answer questions and the forecasts will be updated at this point the market has fully priced in at least two rate cuts from through group through year s end and there is debate over a third that would be an aggressive reversal from multiple hikes still anticipated for 2019 up until the end of last year simply starting a slow path of easing may disappoint the charged risk forecast while matching the expected pace could signal a sense of panic from the key policy group there is a very high probability of volatility and a troublingly high chance of disappointment fomc scenario tableexpect indirect blast for the euro gold and oil between the conflicting forces of hope arising from fed support to the crushing impact from trade wars the result is a greater uncertainty over the future of economic strength it is hard to escape from so systemic an influence and very few markets can reasonable be expected to be exempt from its gravity if the dollar is charged expect the benchmark currency cross eurusd to transmit a strong impact through theeuro beyond just a mirror to the world s most liquid currency the euro is also facing uncertainty in the form of financial and monetary policy stability with union members like italy threatening to ignore the rules while eu officials are contemplating hefty fines add to that the frequent threats by donald trump to turn tariffs onto europe whether on germany for nord stream 2 retaliation for airbus subsidies or blanket auto tariffs and we are left with a constant state of anxiety there is good reason for the currency to flag and yet it has held back the tide how long chart ofeuraudand consecutive candle count daily when it comes to the dollar and economic stability there is an inevitable stake forgoldandcrude oil for the precious metal the role of safe haven and inflation hedgeare distant seconds to the principle role of stable alternative to traditional currencies which is so desperately needed if the fed is successful in calming risk based fears with a substantial swell in its accommodation the greenback will drop in value sharply but it is unlikely cause a systemic turn in expectations for underlying growth that means that the us and other global currencies will feel the pressure of economic struggle and the increasing competitiveness in policy efforts which will unifromly devalue the most liquid stores of wealth if dollar euro poundand yen are all diving there is only one non traditional alternative markets are comfortable to entertain gold chart of gold and daily tails daily meanwhile oil has spent months proving that its focus has shifted away from volatile supply side economics the sharp drop in opec output to five year lows reported this past month has done little to turn the commodity higher that is not particularly surprising as we have seen the pace of expansion flag and thereby demand follow in tandem growth forecasts and

by john pattullo after quantitative easing qe failed to generate sustainable growth or inflation the dial has turned to fiscal policy john pattullo co head of strategic fixed income argues that a successful formula must combine fiscal and monetary policies as well as structural reform what crisis do you remember the global financial crisis ahh you mean the one we are still inâ it is rather amusing that we sometimes get asked the above question we think some investors need to be reminded that we are very much still in the crisis the crisis happened for a number of reasons but it was primarily the result of the enormous amounts of debt raised by households corporations and governments hence a lot of the economic growth prior to the crisis was financed by increasing debt in an unsustainable way remember the great moderation 1 hmmâ eleven years on as the chart below demonstrates the vast majority of countries have more debt than before the crisis began although a few have managed to partially reduce their debt so how on earth can the crisis be over debt loads higher than pre crisis source thomson reuters datastream bis change in aggregate debt 2008 versus 2018 annual as of 12 31 18 gdp stands for gross domestic product note aggregates for household corporate and government there are no easy solutions to reducing too much debt a number of options are available such as growth and inflation which are hard to come by austerity default and or financial repression2 more on this later but the not so distant past may hold lessons that can help japanification alert it was back in 2011 that we started talking about economist richard koo s balance sheet recession thesis 3 it is extraordinary how reading one book the holy grail of macroeconomics lessons from japan s great recession 2009 can completely change your view on economics and the bond markets in 2009 mr koo prophetically forecast that europe would turn japanese we have talked about this for years but it is only recently that our inboxes have been flooded with japanification articles on europe this backdrop explains why throughout most of this period we have favored much longer duration than many in our peer group given our rejection of mainstream conventional economics rather bizarrely we are pleased to get some pushback on our views which suggests there is still money to be made in bonds some investors remain short of duration or have tried their luck diversifying into alternatives away from quality long duration bonds many others though agree with our disinflationary outlook we feel that long term secular drivers such as demographics technology excessive debt and low productivity will dominate and lead to lower global bond yields we doubt that we can sustainably break out into higher inflation and growth but that doesn t mean that politicians with a democratic mandate could try something completely different more on this later wot no growth wot no inflation below is the title slide from our 2013 new year conference presentation wot is an informal british version of what in the presentation we highlighted how small the money multiplier could be compared to the fiscal multiplier in a severely depressed economy our message was that fiscal policy tools should be employed to restore growth but there was no political will at the time for such measures our 2013 presentation cover still relevant today source janus henderson investors january 2013 the global financial crisis was no ordinary recession this was a balance sheet recession whereby individuals and corporations changed their behavior toward borrowing and spending after the trauma of experiencing negative equity in such circumstances lowering interest rates does no good and policies focusing heavily on the monetary side may not be effective as we have seen monetary policy broadly became independent in the 1990s in many countries with the aim of taking politics out of the business cycle keynesian fiscal expansion was pretty much dismissed by conventional economists during this period as being ineffective as the dogmatic maastricht treaty removed the possibility of fiscal expansion in europe the one clubbed golfer of independent interest rates seemed to be the only policy tool while it is true that quantitative easing qe has massively expanded the monetary base as mr koo demonstrates it completely decoupled from the growth in bank lending and money supply as a result we have created asset price inflation in wall street with no trickle down effect to main street the palliative needed was something along the lines of the koo theory koo theory in koo theory the government needs to borrow all the private sector surplus and redistribute it via fiscal policy to stop the economy from shrinking into oblivion this is very much in line with the secular stagnation4 excessive savings hypothesis of american economist larry summers unfortunately european policymakers do not subscribe to the koo thesis and if the surplus is not redistributed you get a deficit of demand and deflation anyone mention europe why then was monetary policy not combined with fiscal policy surely they should be complementary and not treated as substitutes italy for example would have welcomed and still welcomes a massive fiscal expansion even though the maastricht treaty prevents it as mr koo points out you also need structural reform before undertaking fiscal expansion otherwise the effort will fail indeed he said that 80 of the necessary change is structural reform followed by fiscal expansion note that this third arrow of structural reform was never delivered in japan somewhat ironically the inequality brought about by qe has led to the populist backlash in developed economies as well as calls for modern monetary theory mmt 5 fiscal expansion but let s not confuse the two for now what s all this mmt chatter anyway mmt is really just a politicization of fiscal spending with unlimited constraint no one constrained the british and the american fiscal expansion in world war ii tanks and warships were needed so they were made the idea was that governments spend as much as needed to achieve the desired outcome and worry about financing the deficit at a later stage so after the abject failure of qe to generate any sustainable growth or inflation the political dial has turned to fiscal policy now governments are always keen to inflate away their debt by running inflation higher than the nominal yield on the debt that they issue this policy called financial repression is one way to deleverage an economy i e reduce debt interestingly the reduction in debt generally happens via growth in the economy i e higher gross domestic product which reduces the debt as a percentage of gdp but rarely results in a reduction in the absolute level of debt since only very low inflation could be generated interest rates had to go even lower to try to reflate economies and enable negative real interest rates to repress you and i rest assured further financial repression is both required and necessary to reduce global debt levels but the current rate of progress is too slow times are different now the economic downturn that we are in is unlikely to recover to previously normal levels given poor demographics and productivity the future trend rate of growth in both the u s and u k is around 1 5 to 1 75 we are in a different regime after the heart attack of 2008 one of low growth low inflation and increasing financial repression as mentioned earlier mr koo has called for a wartime response on the fiscal side as this is wartime economics but currently no one has the political mandate to justify such a response although things are changing fast so this brings us back to mmt the theory that a government cannot default on its debts if those debts were issued in its own currency is not new there is also a vast amount of economic literature on whether fiscal deficits matter still this is certainty getting a big political push nowadays it is hard to argue that significant expansion in infrastructure housing technology transport and education would not boost the economy and it would surely have a much bigger multiplier effect than qe the tricky bit is how it is financed and the potential repression redistribution of wealth that goes with it could such a stimulus offset long term secular drivers possibly but we are not convinced in mr koo s words mmt proponents are correct in arguing we need enough fiscal stimuli to absorb the private sector savings surplus however this does not necessarily mean we need the central bank to directly finance the stimulus 6 this is a key point in the mmt debate which many people confuse the stimulus should be funded from a private sector savings surplus not by the central bank so what will work we have sympathy for fiscal monetary and structural reform working together but say no to mmt if badly financed it is the combination of these factors that is key fiscal policy can be effective if credibly financed and used at the right time in the cycle further it must be invested and not consumed debate continues about the financing angle with regard to mmt much of which is political and highly ideological the heterodox school of economics to which this is no definitive answer politics may also throw a wrench in the works as to the effectiveness or credible financing of a fiscal expansion approach and positioning we are mindful of mmt risk and think investors should be very selective by company and country with their investments in our opinion u s bond yields are inexpensive and as real yields are positive there is still capital to be made in u s bond markets as that economy slowly turns japanese the u k and parts of europe already have negative real yields we are being repressed slowly consequently in the current environment we think u s corporate and government bonds as well as australian sovereign bonds are well positioned short term cyclical swings such as the two year trump reflation trade can confuse the narrative but overall we continue to believe that most developed world bond yields are heading lower 1a period of economic stability characterized by low inflation positive economic growth and the belief that the boom and bust cycles had been overcome in the uk it generally refers to the period between 1993 and 2007 2in simple terms using regulations and policies to force down interest rates below the rate of inflation also known as a stealth tax that rewards debtors but punishes savers 3 said to occur when high levels of private sector debt cause individuals and or companies to focus on saving by paying down debt rather than spending or investing which in turn results in slow economic growth or even decline the term is attributed to the economist richard koo 4a prolonged period of low or no economic growth within an economy excessive savings act as a drag on demand reducing economic growth and inflation 5an unorthodox approach to economic management which in simple terms argues that countries that issue their own currencies can never run out of money the way people or businesses can in other words governments that have control of the monetary policy are not constrained by tax revenues for their spending developed in the 1990s it has recently

if there was ever a moment when we needed a new vision to bring our people together in the fight for justice decency and human dignity this is that time during a speech at george washington university this week bernie sanders made a case for why socialism is the only way to defeat oligarchy and authoritarianism if there was ever a moment when we needed to stand up and fight against the forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism this is that time said sanders and if there was ever a moment when we needed a new vision to bring our people together in the fight for justice decency and human dignity this is that time sanders is in dangerous territory with fully and publicly embracing democratic socialism something many americans are still not onboard with and virtually no 2020 presidential candidates aside from sanders have even come close to during his speech sanders discussed his economic bill of rights a newly released plan influenced heavily by democratic socialism and fdr sanders believes that if there ever was a moment that we needed to stand up and fight against the forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism this is that time in reference to the massive inequality problem in america that has been exacerbated by the trump administration never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred sanders said quoting fdr while president trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism they don t really oppose all forms of socialism sanders said they may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches trump and other billionaires you can watch sanders full speech above or read the full transcript below be sure to comment here or on facebook and let us know how you feel about democratic socialism in america my friends we are in the midst of a defining and pivotal moment for our country and our planet and with so many crises converging upon us simultaneously it is easy for us to become overwhelmed or depressed or to even throw up our hands in resignation but my message to you today is that if there was ever a moment in the history of our country where despair was not an option this is that time if there was ever a moment where we had to effectively analyze the competing political and social forces which define this historical period this is that time if there was ever a moment when we needed to stand up and fight against the forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism this is that time and if there was ever a moment when we needed a new vision to bring our people together in the fight for justice decency and human dignity this is that time in the year 2019 the united states and the rest of the world face two very different political paths on one hand there is a growing movement towards oligarchy and authoritarianism in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a significant part of the economy and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country on the other hand in opposition to oligarchy there is a movement of working people and young people who in ever increasing numbers are fighting for justice they are the teachers taking to the streets to make certain that schools are adequately funded and that their students get a quality education they are workers at disney amazon walmart and the fast food industry standing up and fighting for a living wage of at least 15 an hour and the right to have a union they are young people taking on the fossil fuel industry and demanding policies that transform our energy system and protect our planet from the ravages of climate change they are women who refuse to give control of their bodies to local state and federal politicians they are people of color and their allies demanding an end to systemic racism and massive racial inequities that exist throughout our society they are immigrants and their allies fighting to end the demonization of undocumented people and for comprehensive immigration reform when we talk about oligarchy let us be clear about what we mean right now in the united states of america three families control more wealth than the bottom half of our country some 160 million americans the top 1 own more wealth than the bottom 92 and 49 of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 in fact income and wealth inequality today in the united states is greater than at any time since the 1920s and when we talk about oligarchy it is not just that the very rich are getting much richer it is that tens of millions of working class people in the wealthiest country on earth are suffering under incredible economic hardship desperately trying to survive today nearly 40 million americans live in poverty and tonight 500 000 people will be sleeping out on the streets about half of the country lives paycheck to paycheck as tens of millions of our people are an accident a divorce a sickness or a layoff away from economic devastation while many public schools throughout the country lack the resources to adequately educate our young people we are the most heavily incarcerated nation on earth after decades of policies that have encouraged and subsidized unbridled corporate greed we now have an economy that is fundamentally broken and grotesquely unfair even while macroeconomic numbers like gdp the stock market and the unemployment rate are strong millions of middle class and working people struggle to keep their heads above water while the billionaire class consumes the lion s share of the wealth that we are collectively creating as a nation in the midst of a so called booming economy real wages for the average worker have barely risen at all and despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity the average wage of the american worker in real dollars is no higher than it was 46 years ago and millions of people are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive and here is something quite incredible that tells you all you need to know about the results of unfettered capitalism all of us want to live long happy and productive lives but in america today the very rich live on average 15 years longer than the poorest americans in 2014 in mcdowell county west virginia one of the poorest counties in the nation life expectancy for men was 64 years in fairfax county virginia a wealthy county just 350 miles away life expectancy for men was nearly 82 years an 18 year differential the life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years in other words the issue of unfettered capitalism is not just an academic debate poverty economic distress and despair are life threatening issues for millions of working people in the country while the rich get richer they live longer lives while poor and working families struggle economically and often lack adequate health care their life expectancy is declining for the first time in modern american history taken together the american dream of upward mobility is in peril in fact if we don t turn things around our younger generation will for the first time in living memory have a lower standard of living than their parents this is not acceptable globally the situation is even more shocking with most of the world s wealth concentrated among a very few while billions of people have almost nothing today the world s richest 26 billionaires now own as much wealth as the poorest 3 8 billion people on the planet half of the world s population but the struggle we are facing today is not just economic across the globe the movement toward oligarchy runs parallel to the growth of authoritarian regimes like putin in russia xi in china mohamed bin salman in saudi arabia rodrigo duterte in the philippines jair bolsonaro in brazil and viktor orbán in hungry among others these leaders meld corporatist economics with xenophobia and authoritarianism they redirect popular anger about inequality and declining economic conditions into violent rage against minorities whether they are immigrants racial minorities religious minorities or the lgbt community and to suppress dissent they are cracking down on democracy and human rights in the united states of course we have our own version of this movement which is being led by president trump and many of his republican allies who are attempting to divide our country up and attack these same communities how sad it is that president trump sees these authoritarian leaders as friends and allies this authoritarian playbook is not new the challenge we confront today as a nation and as a world is in many ways not different from the one we faced a little less than a century ago during and after the great depression in the 1930s then as now deeply rooted and seemingly intractable economic and social disparities led to the rise of right wing nationalist forces all over the world in europe the anger and despair was ultimately harnessed by authoritarian demagogues who fused corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia into a political movement that amassed totalitarian power destroyed democracy and ultimately murdering millions of people including members of my own family but we must remember that those were not the only places where dark forces tried to rise up today we are all rightly repulsed by the sight of neo nazis and klansmen openly marching in charlottesville va and we are horrified by houses of worship being shot up by right wing terrorists but on february 20 1939 over 20 000 nazis held a mass rally not in berlin not in rome but in madison square garden in front of a 30 foot tall banner of george washington bordered with swastikas in new york city but back then those american extremists could not replicate the success of their authoritarian brethren across the ocean because we in the united states thankfully made a different choice than europe did in responding to the era s social and economic crises we rejected the ideology of mussolini and hitler we instead embraced the bold and visionary leadership of president franklin delano roosevelt then the leader of the progressive wing of the democratic party together with organized labor leaders in the african american community and progressives inside and outside the party roosevelt led a transformation of the american government and the american economy like today the quest for transformative change was opposed by big business wall street the political establishment by the republican party and by the conservative wing of fdr s own democratic party and he faced the same scare tactics then that we experience today red baiting xenophobia racism and anti semitism in a famous 1936 campaign speech roosevelt stated we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering they had begun to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affairs we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred despite that opposition by rallying the american people fdr and his progressive coalition created the new deal won four terms and created an economy that worked for all and not just the few today new deal initiatives like social security unemployment compensation the right to form a union the minimum wage protection for farmers regulation of wall street and massive infrastructure improvements are considered pillars of american society but while he stood up for the working families of our country we can never forget that president roosevelt was reviled by the oligarchs of his time who berated these extremely popular programs as socialism similarly in the 1960s when lyndon johnson brought about medicare medicaid and other extremely popular programs he was also viciously attacked by the ruling class of this country and here is the point it is no exaggeration to state that not only did fdr s agenda improve the lives of millions of americans but the new deal was enormously popular politically and helped defeat far right extremism for a time today america and the world are once again moving towards authoritarianism and the same right wing forces of oligarchy corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia are on the march pushing us to make the apocalyptically wrong choice that europe made in the last century today we now see a handful of billionaires with unprecedented wealth and power we see huge private monopolies operating outside of any real democratic oversight and often subsidized by taxpayers with the power to control almost every aspect of our lives they are the profit taking gatekeepers of our health care our technology our finance system our food supply and almost all of the other basic necessities of life they are wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex and giant agri businesses they are the entities with unlimited wealth who surround our nation s capitol with thousands of well paid lobbyists who to a significant degree write the laws that we live under today we have a demagogue in the white house who for cheap political gain is attempting to deflect the attention of the american people away from the real crises that we face and instead is doing what demagogues always do and that is divide people up and legislate hatred this is a president who supports brutal family separations border walls muslim bans anti lgbt policies deportations and voter suppression it is my very strong belief that the united states must reject that path of hatred and divisiveness and instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path a higher path a path of compassion justice and love it is the path that i call democratic socialism over eighty years ago franklin delano roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion this is the unfinished business of the democratic party and the vision we must accomplish in order to accomplish that goal it means committing ourselves to protecting political rights to protecting civil rights and to protect economic rights of all people in this country as fdr stated in his 1944 state of the union address we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence today our bill of rights guarantees the american people a number of important constitutionally protected political rights and while we understand that these rights have not always been respected and we have so much more work to do we are proud that our constitution guarantees freedom of religion freedom of expression freedom of assembly a free press and other rights because we understand that we can never have true american freedom unless we are free from authoritarian tyranny now we must take the next step forward and guarantee every man woman and child in our country basic economic rights the right to quality health care the right to as much education as one needs to succeed in our society the right to a good job that pays a living wage the right to affordable housing the right to a secure retirement and the right to live in a clean environment we must recognize that in the 21st century in the wealthiest country in the history of the world economic rights are human rights that is what i mean by democratic socialism as dr martin luther king jr said call it democracy or call it democratic socialism but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of god s children to realize this vision we must not view america only as a population of disconnected individuals we must also view ourselves as part of an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny as dr king put it in other words we are in this together we must see ourselves as part of one nation one community and one society regardless of race gender religion sexual orientation or country of origin this quintessentially american idea is literally emblazoned on our coins e pluribus unum from the many one and i should tell you it is enshrined in the motto of our campaign for the presidency not me us let me be clear i do understand that i and other progressives will face massive attacks from those who attempt to use the word socialism as a slur but i should also tell you that i have faced and overcome these attacks for decades and i am not the only one let us remember that in 1932 republican president herbert hoover claimed that franklin roosevelt s new deal was a disguise for the totalitarian state in 1936 former democratic new york governor and presidential candidate al smith said in a speech about fdr s new deal policies just get the platform of the democratic party and get the platform of the socialist party and lay them down on your dining room table side by side when president harry truman proposed a national health care program the american medical association hired ronald reagan as their pitchman the ama called the legislation that stemmed from his proposal socialized medicine claiming that white house staff were followers of the moscow party line in 1960 ronald reagan in a letter to richard nixon wrote the following about john f kennedy under the tousled boyish haircut is still old karl marx in the 1990s then congressman newt gingrich claimed president bill clinton s health care plan was centralized bureaucratic socialism the conservative heritage foundation has claimed that the children s health insurance program chip was a step towards socialism former speaker of the house john boehner claimed the stimulus package the omnibus spending bill and the budget proposed by president barack obama were all one big down payment on a new american socialist experiment in this regard president harry truman was right when he said that socialism is the epithet they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years socialism is what they called social security socialism is what they called farm price supports socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people now let s be clear while president trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism they don t really oppose all forms of socialism they may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches trump and other billionaires let us never forget the unbelievable hypocrisy of wall street the high priests of unfettered capitalism in 2008 after their greed recklessness and illegal behavior created the worst financial disaster since the great depression with millions of americans losing their jobs their homes and their life savings wall street s religious adherence to unfettered capitalism suddenly came to an end overnight wall street became big government socialists and begged for the largest federal bailout in american history some 700 billion from the treasury and trillions in support from the federal reserve but it s not just wall street that loves socialism when it works for them it is the norm across the entire corporate world the truth is corporate america receives hundreds of billions of dollars in federal support every single year while these same people are trying to cut programs that benefit ordinary americans if you are a fossil fuel company whose carbon emissions are destroying the planet you get billions in government subsidies including special tax breaks royalty relief funding for research and development and numerous tax loopholes if you are a pharmaceutical company you make huge profits on patent rights for medicines that were developed with taxpayer funded research if you are a monopoly like amazon owned by the wealthiest person in america you get hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives from taxpayers to build warehouses and you end up paying not one penny in federal income taxes if you are the walton family the wealthiest family in america you get massive government subsidies because your low wage workers are forced to rely on food stamps medicaid and public housing in order to survive all paid for by taxpayers if you are the trump family you got 885 million worth of tax breaks and subsidies for your family s housing empire that is built on racial discrimination when trump screams socialism all of his hypocrisy will not be lost on the american people americans will know that he is attacking all that we take for granted from social security to medicare to veterans health care to roads and bridges to public schools to national parks to clean water and clean air when trump attacks socialism i am reminded of what dr martin luther king jr said this country has socialism for the rich rugged individualism for the poor and that is the difference between donald trump and me he believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful i believe in a democratic socialism that works for the working families of this country what i believe is that the american people deserve freedom true freedom freedom is an often used word but it s time we took a hard look at what that word actually means ask yourself what does it actually mean to be free are you truly free if you are unable to go to a doctor when you are sick or face financial bankruptcy when you leave the hospital are you truly free if you cannot afford the prescription drug you need to stay alive are you truly free when you spend half of your limited income on housing and are forced to borrow money from a payday lender at 200 interest rates are you truly free if you are 70 years old and forced to work because you lack a pension or enough money to retire are you truly free if you are unable to go to attend college or a trade school because your family lacks the income are you truly free if you are forced to work 60 or 80 hours a week because you can t find a job that pays a living wage are you truly free if you are a mother or father with a new born baby but you are forced to go back to work immediately after the birth because you lack paid family leave are you truly free if you are a small business owner or family farmer who is driven out by the monopolistic practices of big business are you truly free if you are a veteran who put your life on the line to defend this country and now sleep out on the streets to me the answer to those questions in the wealthiest nation on earth is no you are not free while the bill of rights protects us from the tyranny of an oppressive government many in the establishment would like the american people to submit to the tyranny of oligarchs multinational corporations wall street banks and billionaires it is time for the american people to stand up and fight for their right to freedom human dignity and security this is the core of what my politics is all about in 1944 fdr proposed an economic bill of rights but died a year later and was never able to fulfil that vision our job 75 years later is to complete what roosevelt started that is why today i am proposing a 21st century economic bill of rights a bill of rights that establishes once and for all that every american regardless of his or her income in entitled to the right to a decent job that pays a living wage the right to quality health care the right to a complete education the right to affordable housing the right to a clean environment the right to a secure retirement over the course of this election my campaign has been releasing and will continue to release detailed proposals addressing each of these yet to be realized economic rights we will also address the attacks that are being launched each day against the civil rights and civil liberties of our people and let me be absolutely clear democratic socialism to me requires achieving political and economic freedom in every community and let me also be clear the only way we achieve these goals is through a political revolution where millions of people get involved in the political process and reclaim our democracy by having the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests whose greed is destroying the social and economic fabric of our country at the end of the day the one percent may have enormous wealth and power but they are just the one percent when the 99 percent stand together we can transform society these are my values and that is why i call myself a democratic socialist at its core is a deep and abiding faith in the american people to peacefully and democratically enact the transformative change that will create shared prosperity social equality and true freedom for all

the week ahead is likely to provide some clarification for investors on three fronts that have been a source of uncertainty the fomc meeting with updated forecasts is center stage the credit markets are pushing the fed to be aggressive but can be disappointed in the eurozone the preliminary pmi may confirm a modest even if uneven recovery the g20 summit is the focus of much attention as many see it as the last opportunity to avoid a further escalation of trade tensions between the world s two largest economies in a repeat of the buenos aires gathering at the end of last year fomc us jobs data disappointed and prices were soft the 3 month to 10 year yield curve continues to be inverted after the may retail sales data that showed a resilient consumer the interpolated odds of a rate cut now were halved to around 15 the implied yield of the january 2020 futures contract is about 1 705 currently the effective average fed funds rate is 2 37 that implies 67 bp of easing continues to be discounted which is 100 confidence of two 25 bp moves and roughly a 2 3 chance of a third cut this year the odds of a third cut this year may be a bit exaggerated if one assumes the fed could lower the interest on reserves further away from upper end of the target range after next week s meeting there are four meetings left in the year the fomc statement will likely recognize that the slowing of jobs growth which is still sufficient to keep the unemployment rate at the lowest in the generation and new cyclical lows of the underemployment rate it will also recognize that prices pressures remain soft previously the fed maintained that the weaker inflation readings for transitory it may be too early to abandon such views the confidence in the assertion may have weakened the same crosscurrents that led the fed to shift to its current patient and wait and see stance from the previous tightening bias are likely to drive the fomc to adopt a more formal easing bias in its word cues these crosscurrents include trade tensions the slowing of global growth the risk of a disruptive uk exit from the eu as well as the fading fiscal stimulus in the us and the maturing of the expansion at the same time the fed officials have recognized that the strength of the labor market and the retail sales report points to stronger household consumption the point is that while the fed has the same information set if not a bit more than market participants it does not have the urgency to move it wants to assure the market that it can and will ease policy when the outlook warrants a more moderate position looked for the fed to take out an insurance policy as it were later in late q3 or early q4 if the crosscurrents have been lifted the economy outperformed in q1 and maybe have slowed below trend in q2 the atlanta fed s gdpnow tracker for q2 rose to 2 1 from 1 4 after revising the annualized personal consumption component of gdp to a very respectable 3 9 this implies that net net the other parts of the economy government investment and net exports contracted in q2 the economic performance in early q3 and the global outlook may be more important than the current economic readings an insurance policy does not require a 50 bp move the resumption of asset purchases or the start of a monetary cycle emu flash pmi there is a certain pessimism that hangs over discussions about europe the export oriented model has been undermined by the slowing of global growth and in particular china but also turkey italy and the ec are sliding toward a confrontation the risks of no deal brexit and falling back to wto commitments are increasing and although the ineptitude of the uk is broadly recognized a failure to reach an agreement does not reflect well on the eu either and it will bear some cost to the disruption the eurozone hit a soft patch but it appears to be emerging from it even in not in a spectacular way the flash pmi readings for june are the most important and do a fairly good job of anticipating the final even though the month is barely half over the manufacturing pmi has been below the 50 boom bust level since january and averaged 49 1 in q1 it appears to have bottomed in march at 47 5 if it were to up to 48 0 as the median forecast in the bloomberg survey shows it would be a four month high the services pmi has been more resilient which also underscores the source of the shock is external it averaged 52 4 in q1 after bottoming in last december and january at 51 2 the composite put in a low in january and february 50 9 51 0 it averaged 51 5 in q1 and if it ticks up like the economists project the q2 average will be a little higher the ecb does not need to feel action is urgent it will provide new targeted refinancing loans the macro situation is at crossroads and the outcome will be considerably clear later this year two foreseeable potential shocks are a no deal brexit and trade conflict with the us the escalation of the us china trade war is not good for europe either on several different levels since draghi s term is nearly over there is an understandable reluctance to pre commit such as extending the forward guidance out much further now mid 2020 the other policy levers rates and asset purchases could come at a high price deeper negative yields and credibility issues after ending the purchases so recently as us tariffs on china will have the unintended consequence of accelerating local companies climb up the value added ladder so too will the us criticism of europe and the weaponization of access to the dollar market accelerate europe s commitment to pursue alternatives it is not just about the sanctions on iran but also the threats of sanctions on germany and companies involved with constructing the pipeline with russia and just like the us can threaten to remove the special treatment is gives goods from hong kong not subject to the tariffs on china it can threaten to exempt the uk from a tariff on european autos sun tzu taught to divided your enemies but the us appears to go out of its way to unite them just like huawei will break the us duopoly on mobile operating systems many countries want to break the us dollar clearing monopoly which allows it to project its authority where ever there are dollar payments the combination of the uk leaving the eu and the us erratic politics bush obama trump is a force that can forge a more united europe if some modus vivendi can be found on the monetary and economic union if european leaders cannot seize this opportunity it will be ill prepared for the pressure comes as the world s two largest economies simultaneously pursue import substitution strategies trade while the uk leaves and the us economic nationalism rises the eu has been securing new trade agreements canada japan and soon mercosur to secure alternative supplies to america china has reduced the tariffs it charges others what this means is that the average tariff in the us is going up while the average tariff of many other countries is falling the us has to play catch up more than setting the bar the trans pacific partnership and japan eu agreement and china s non us tariff cuts have put us farmers and factories at a disadvantage imagine that after hemming and hawing chinese president xi was going to accept the invitation to meet trump on the sidelines of the g20 meeting then an impatient trump threatens china if xi does not meet him the us will slap a 25 tariff on the remaining 300 bln of chinese goods that are not yet covered if xi meets he is bowing to trump and the tariffs could still come into effect or be used again as leverage on china if xi does not meet trump he faces tariffs and more xi is unlikely to refuse outright trump s invite despite increasing evidence that america aims to contain china s growth and development and prevent it from being the world s superpower to paraphrase the american president trump s economic adviser kudlow also reiterated that the us has no interest in a balanced deal because the us has been disadvantaged for so long it is insisting on better terms for itself it is virtually a warning that any agreement will see china lose it might be like buying a negative yielding bond trump took the initiative by threatening china xi can take it back by signaling that while he cannot meet with trump at the g20 meeting he would be happy to see the us president in china at some later date in beijing chinese officials likely assume that the tariffs on nearly all of its exports to the us will be implemented no matter way it does china went into the gunfight with trump with a knife it assumed trump was interested in a transactional trade deal that reduced the bilateral deficit substantially and this is what treasury secretary mnuchin had secured a year ago which trump summarily rejected yet it seems that it has only been since trump tweeted the end of the tariff truce and his subsequent candid comments that chinese officials recognize a rubicon has been crossed that is what the references to the long march mean there seem to be many signs that china is preparing a long sustained multifaceted and global rivalry with the us the economic hardship that cannot be offset through government policies can be blamed on the us and foster chinese nationalism china has a long history of scars that it can point to how it has been wronged by westerners in its narrative china blurs us role despite it having defended china s territorial integrity in the face of european and japanese imperialism in late19th and early 20th centuries yet now there are many points of diverging interest including not asking but telling china it can no longer purchase iranian oil the us acknowledges one china but insists on selling advanced fighter jets to one breakaway province and protests when a special administrative region considers a law that allows china to extradite people back to the mainland for breaking chinese laws the us is seen by chinese officials as trying to frustrate it at every turn like the aiib and the belt road initiative merely reducing the bilateral deficit and adhering the rules of the wto will not be sufficient to appease america many experts argue that the wto rules are not enough to manage to the cunning prc and seem to advocate ex post facto regulations designed to outlaw specific current chinese practices trump says he wants a grand deal or no deal and apparently the judgment about the security risks posed by huawei can be part of the discussion xi knows that no such grand deal is possible for a us president who seemingly does not appreciate nuance this is seen as a rejection by accepting as inevitable new tariffs on more chinese goods xi effectively neutralizes trump s thought to be leverage this calculation that xi may have more to lose than to gain by meeting trump at the g20 should inform us policymakers it should warn investors the risk of a market disturbance as they position for the g20 meeting which could mean unwinding some current exposures at the same time businesses should recognize that the one worldism since the collapse of the soviet union and the advent of the world wide web appears increasingly likely to be divided disclaimer

america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these statements range from flatly false to mostly so here s a week of political rhetoric in review iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of

to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4

collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with

and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter the federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is

weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated

just how low can they go it is the big question on interest rates being asked of central banks mired in a world of low inflation and less than robust growth key points markets expect more rate cuts from us federal reserve perhaps starting this week markets expect more rate cuts from us federal reserve perhaps starting this week growing number of economists expect rba will cut to 0 5pc growing number of economists expect rba will cut to 0 5pc oil market delicately balanced between falling demand and supply concerns over renewed us iran tensions the us federal reserve s open market committee fomc meets this week and may knock rates down another peg the betting is 50 50 but at the very least the fomc will have to maintain a strong bias to more cuts in its post meeting commentary the bank of england also has a chance to cut although it probably won t and the bank of japan with its official rate already pegged below zero has nowhere to go and will probably be on hold again but it is the fed s decision that really matters pivotal week to an extent the fed and its chair jerome powell are in a jam having raised expectations of a cut despite the economy remaining in relatively good shape despite gdp growth in the us nudging above 3 per cent almost record unemployment and reasonable wage growth markets and significantly the white house are clamouring for another cut only last week president trump reached into his bountiful bag of insults to inform the world the fed didn t have a clue about setting interest rates in some economies it might be deeply concerning to have the boss denouncing a central bank as clueless in the us it s a signal to buy us markets have rallied around 5 per cent this month largely on the back of softer economic data and mr powell s comments the fed

fairly sharp retreat if a rate cut is not delivered on wednesday the market has somehow convinced themselves that we are in an easing cycle i am not sure how we got so far ahead of ourselves national securities market strategist art hogan said so now you ve got powell kind of painted into a corner that he is really going to have to navigate carefully because you have market expectations that he said he would do whatever is appropriate the market expectation is around three cuts in the us by the end of the year in australia two cuts are fully priced in however those two cuts may be conservative as an increasing number of economists are arguing for a cash rate of 0 5 per cent or lower the market has priced in two full 25 basis point cuts by the end of the year source asx unemployment needs to fall to 4 5pc rbc s su lin ong added another cut to her expectations following a speech in which rba assistant governor luci ellis argued unemployment needed to fall a lot more if the economy and wages were to pick up the rba now appears to be thinking an unemployment rate of 4 5 per cent of lower would get things back on track and it not just the unemployment rate that is remaining stubbornly high there is still a large degree of slackness in the labour market with underemployment those in work but looking for more stuck near historical highs while ms ong is not a cheer leader for rates cuts she is now forecasting the cash rate will be 0 5 per cent by the end of next year it is often forgotten that the rba has a dual mandate a full employment target as well as an inflation target in the pursuit of economic prosperity ms ong noted ellis has effectively suggested that full employment is far lower than previously thought in practice this means that monetary policy needs to be recalibrated ms ong said if you add in the expected cooling of developed economies next year then the rba cutting its cash rate below 1 per cent is largely sealed we remain mindful that policy traction from further rba cuts to an ever lower cash rate is likely to be less effective especially given the elevated level of household indebtedness she warned ms ong said as the rba hits the lower limits of interest rate cuts the greater is the need for policy responses from government as we head closer to the lower bound we hope that the emerging discussion around more active counter cyclical fiscal policy steps up additional productive infrastructure investment additional expenditure on skills and resourcing the bringing forward of income tax cuts acceleration in the reduction of small medium company tax cuts the idea that unemployment needs to be sharply lower while the rba has just about exhausted its traditional policy options may well be explored more when governor philp lowe addresses a business lunch in adelaide this thursday on the hot topic of the labour market and spare capacity oil price rises despite falling demand to say the oil market is delicately poised is an understatement that the global brent crude benchmark edged up on friday was not surprising given the escalating tensions and rhetoric between the us and iran over a series of attacks on tankers and facilities near the strait of hormuz the cause of the explosions that left two tankers smouldering and stricken in the gulf of oman is still a point of furious disagreement between the us and iran and talk of iranian military fast boats hampering salvage efforts didn t help sentiment however another gloomy downgrade for demand is acting in the other direction against supply worries inherent in friction in the biggest chokepoint in the seaborne oil trade the international energy agency cut its forecast for demand this year by another 100 000 barrels a day with crumbling global trade prospects central to the calculations a day earlier oil cartel opec also took a knife to its 2019 forecast with an even gloomier view of demand barely above 1 1 million barrels day the main focus is on oil demand as economic sentiment weakens the consequences for oil demand are becoming apparent the iea said the worsening trade outlook a common theme across all regions while the iea is relatively sanguine about the events of last week off the iranian coast arguing supply elsewhere is building it perhaps misses the point oil is only a bargaining chip in the conflict in the strait of hormuz the real fight is over us trade sanctions crippling iran and iran s determination to push ahead with its nuclear ambitions and strategic alliances that are hostile to us and its allies it is a very vicious and dangerous circle if the situation deteriorates a trade war will seem pretty mild by comparison australia date event comment forecast monday 17 6 2019 suncorp investor

washington in president donald trump s reckoning an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these statements range from flatly false to mostly so here s a week of political rhetoric in review iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated

demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of

tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase by 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea the border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports the russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter the federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego tom krisher in detroit and jon gambrell in dubai

companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego tom krisher in detroit and jon gambrell in dubai

korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these statements range from flatly false to mostly so here s a week of political rhetoric in review iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the

international trade is in a period of upheaval with good albeit misplaced intentions president donald trump has proposed aggressive protectionist trade policies however that instability will backfire because investors do not like uncertainty risk aversion is a fundamental aspect of investor behavior and it is not limited to stock market participants corporate leaders are also naturally risk averse being a business leader means taking calculated risks in periods of uncertainty leaders wait for clarity they pause because that is the safest action but moving forward is what drives the economy and improves the lives of workers consumers and trading partners since the 1930s trade liberalization has steadily advanced creating opportunities for companies to sell and produce internationally at lower costs free trade has given consumers access to better products at cheaper prices and helped u s firms to expand their administrative role in the global economy unfortunately in the process some lower skilled workers were displaced overall though free trade has been a force for economic development both domestically and internationally president trump wants to implement trade policy that would return us to the halcyon days of u s manufacturing dominance that ideology is misguided and is already impacting corporate investment and consumer prices if our wages were competitive with china or mexico his goal might make sense but the average manufacturing worker in china earns 10 000 while the average mexican worker earns 5 000 annually in comparison u s manufacturing workers average 45 000 per year bringing back low paying jobs will not develop our economy or help u s workers who will not perform manual labor below minimum wage instead the costs of labor would rise dramatically and prices would adjust accordingly some labor inflation could be offset by logistics savings for high labor content products we would pay dramatically higher prices and could experience supply shortages as some companies are unable to fill open positions at competitive wages while wage increases sound appealing they would come at a cost to consumers some people might earn slightly more than today but everyone s real purchasing power would decrease as prices on everything from agricultural products to health care would rise however that scenario is not likely instead of moving production from mexico to the u s and significantly increasing labor cost to avoid tariffs production will likely move to another low cost country such as brazil 7 000 average annual manufacturing wage india 1 250 russia 7 200 and vietnam 3 000 it would take a global tariff system to prevent this type of market response a global tariff system would likely have far ranging impacts including global destabilization simultaneous inflation and recession and potential global stock market crashes wall street is already leery of potential impacts of the trade war investors know increasing costs for multinationals either tariffs or labor costs reduce corporate profits as profits retreat so do stock prices and with them incentives for innovation and entrepreneurship falling stock prices likely mean more layoffs and price increases as firms try to maintain corporate profit margins valuations and earnings what should the president do with trade and economic policy mr trump should lead the u s in making the most of our natural advantages the united states has world class capital markets and research universities he should not stifle those institutions by restricting immigration taxing endowments and inflating stock markets by manipulating tax policy and interest rates he should take advantage of our resources to lead an innovation revolution innovation brings higher wages for workers opportunities for economic growth higher employment and offers spillover benefits to consumers in all sectors of the economy if the president is worried about displaced workers he should provide subsidized training opportunities and invest in them training would improve their earning potential this would be good for displaced workers firms looking for skilled workers and trading partners willing to manufacture our new products more importantly president trump should be more predictable and stable in managing foreign trade he must signal that business leaders should not fear making investments even abroad when it makes sense decreasing the uncertainty aligning policy with incentives and investing in the future will provide the best outcome for everyone in the united states which is exactly what mr trump is charged with doing gregory sabin is a senior lecturer at the questrom school of business at boston university where he teaches managerial accounting and corporate finance he is affiliated faculty at harvard university and a member of the american accounting association prior to academia dr sabin spent 12 years in industry where he held senior management roles at companies including ford motor company honeywell international and the kellogg company his industry experience centered on international finance and operations his research focuses

more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports the russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter the federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego tom krisher in detroit and jon gambrell in dubai

washington ap in president donald trump s reckoning an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these statements range from flatly false to mostly so here s a week of political rhetoric in review iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english advertising ___ wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 advertising ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president advertising the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps advertising the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers advertising the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact advertising it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap advertising u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation advertising the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the

trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia

here is part of the trade off with diversification you must be diversified enough to survive bad times or bad luck so that skill and good process can have the chance to pay off over the long term howard marks the roller coaster market swings continue to baffle many investors coming into the week of june 3rd the s p was about as oversold as it has been in a while just five trading days later as we entered this past week there was already a hint of an overbought situation in the short term the indices settled down and entered into pause mode as they got closer to the old highs extremes whether it be in valuations or investor emotions are always corrected it is just a matter of time reversion to the mean or the correction of any extreme usually is an unpleasant event when it comes to the markets that comes about because not only is the swing back to the norm very volatile but also as we have seen in the past the market then typically overshoots in the other direction since the fourth quarter of 2018 the stock market has been a great example of that fast forward to the present day and we now see that after the streak of weekly declines in the dow and the s p was broken one has to wonder if a dash in the opposite direction has just started the u s stock market has come roaring back in recent weeks with a gain of about 5 since the first trading day of june over the last few days the indices settled into a narrow 40 point trading range this week sitting just above support but below a resistance zone below the old highs the s p was basically flat for the week which follows the 4 4 gain in the prior week despite the backdrop of negativity the index is up 15 for the year global markets stabilized and moved higher as well buoyed by plunging interest rates as bad economic data led traders to press bets for multiple fed cuts this year the weakening of the usd this week was also a substantial driver of returns by asset class investors face a slew of psychological challenges perhaps the most difficult is updating beliefs when new information arrives enter this entire tariff issue that has been with investors since early 2018 in my view the explanation for the wild swings in emotion and stock prices we can see how overwhelming all of this can be when we consider that the average person has more information available to them in a week than a person in the seventeenth century had available in a lifetime the real issue for investors comes down to absorbing this abundance of information which contains a great deal of not so good news what makes this even more difficult is that the human brain is evolutionarily wired to seek out and process potentially dangerous stimuli that could do us harm peter diamandis and steven kotler touched upon the subject in their best selling book abundance the future is better than you think this fight or flight response served people well back in prehistoric times when it was necessary to simply survive the day now it interferes with our processes to obtain and understand knowledge in a much more advanced technological surrounding that abounds with headlines and sound bites as the authors of abundance also point out unlike the threats to human life back in the prehistoric setting the dangers today can be described as probabilities and that is a huge difference the economy might nosedive china can send the world into global recession there could be a terrorist attack crude oil can drop to 30 a barrel the fed is on the wrong track etc however our brain s early warning system can t tell the difference between these probabilities and real danger what makes the situation worse the system is also designed not to shut off until the potential danger has vanished completely but threats that may take place never vanish completely this is why there are so many pundits and strategists who love to constantly sell fear about bad things happening the desire for it is based on a psychological fascination of bad news that could potentially do us harm however unlikely the threat and this is also exactly why i repeatedly tell nervous investors that if they are waiting for the uncertainty in the markets to disappear before putting capital to work they re never going to buy stocks again if one thinks the wall of worry is just a tired old axiom please think again so while there are great sources of solid informative data out there and of course there are times when caution is warranted you have to be on high alert whenever you come across these overly negative news items simply because evolution has made it very easy to become a victim to the makeup of our brains that involve decision making and survival i think it is necessary to always pound the table regarding the topic of human behavior and investing if nothing else it is to constantly remind myself of the dangers that emotion brings to the table when managing money in my view it is the reason why some investors are successful and so many fail last week i posed the question can we talk ourselves into recession who knows what the final outcome of the ongoing trade tensions will be we have already heard fed governors say they haven t seen any major impact on the economy that doesn t seem to resonate with anyone because we are being told a different story every day of the week the concern that we should be paying attention to is the mindset that is prevalent now the impact the trade situation is having on business confidence at the end of the day how much of that will increasingly filter down to consumer confidence finally impacting hard economic data we keep hearing the same negative overtones of how terrible the situation is keep telling yourself things and soon they become reality in your mind a self fulfilling prophecy if the worst case scenario does not come to pass that could easily elongate the runway between now and the next recession in the meantime any investor that stays focused on what really matters will be able to seek out the opportunities that the market is presenting the inevitable gyrations are a great time to rebalance portfolios economy in summary the economy here in the u s remains stable but just about every forecast for q2 gdp is in the 1 range remember q1 was also forecast to be at that level but rolled in at 3 1 new york fed gdp forecasting models for 2q19 are moving lower chart courtesy of charles schwab inc the consensus view says trade tariffs will have a big impact on the economy and that has been the commentary since early 2018 perhaps a more realistic common sense approach need be considered the fact that tax cuts and deregulation aren t going away is seemingly left out of the equation while the trade tariffs are given an extreme negative weighting so far those extremes have yet to materialize given all of the angst over tariffs and effects on the economy the worst case scenario might be a return to the 2 growth days the benefits of tax cuts and deregulation offset by the impact of the tariffs roughly equal the negative effects of the past administration s tax hikes and over regulation urban carmel shares a few graphics that show the economy remains stable and there is no recession in sight new high in full time jobs new home sales in march reached a new cycle high and grew 7 year over year in april in the past 50 years a median of 28 months has lapsed between new home sales expansion high arrows and the start of the next recession so the recent cyclical high two months ago is a significant positive real retail sales declined on a year over year basis in december but rebounded to just 1 1 growth in april the trend flattened in the period prior to the past two recessions and there is some risk that the same is beginning to happen now here is an issue that needs to be monitored the may retail sales result detailed later in the article shows a nice rebound in addition he notes that the 3 1 compensation growth is near a 10 yr high and core inflation is still near 2 0 it appears the ceos are taking the lead on the idea of talking ourselves into a recession may ppi rose 0 1 while the core rate rose 0 2 following respective gains of 0 2 and 0 1 in april on a 12 month basis the headline rate slowed to 1 8 y y versus 2 2 y y and the core rate was 2 3 y y from 2 4 y y may cpi report undershot assumptions with 0 1 gains for both the headline and the core that rounded from respective increases of 0 077 and 0 113 analysts now have six month average cpi price gains of just 0 157 for the headline and 0 155 for the core another datapoint that puts a dent in the idea that tariffs will increase costs causing inflation to spike nfib small business optimism index rose 1 4 to 105 0 in may after climbing 1 7 to 103 5 in april it s a fourth consecutive monthly gain the best in two years and puts the index at the highest since october and it compares to the historic high of 108 8 from august a third of all small business owners cite labor quality or costs as their most important problem may retail sales rose 0 5 for both headline and ex autos headline april sales were revised to a 0 3 increase was 0 2 and march was bumped to 1 8 from 1 7 industrial production increased 0 4 in may with capacity utilization rising to 78 1 both better than expected the 0 5 decline in april production was bumped up to 0 4 but march was nudged down to a 0 1 gain from 0 2 jolts report job openings dropped 25k to 7 449k in april after bouncing 332k to 7 474k in march revised from 7 488k though openings have been eroding in recent months they are not far off from the 7 626 historic high from november the jolts rate was unchanged at 4 7 and is up from 4 5 in february mortgage rates dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years so total mortgage applications surged 26 8 in just one week according to the mortgage bankers association s seasonally adjusted index volume was 41 higher than a year ago global economy manufacturing activity in the eurozone continues to run at a much more robust pace than other indicators pmis on a 3 month 3 month annualized basis through april industrial output rose 2 6 annualized while manufacturing production rose 3 3 annualized with german exports values down almost 4 in april it s worth wondering where the shock is coming from everyone is assuming it is all about china but the data doesn t support that theory through march export growth had held up very well despite collapsing manufacturing surveys and new order numbers the source of the shock is not china at least not directly looking for outliers there are three countries that saw their share of german exports fall from 2017 s average by at least 0 2 through march those three countries are turkey korea and sweden turkey is in the midst of a full blown foreign exchange crisis and has been for the past year while the other two are small open economies with exposure to the global cycle all three have seen share of exports plunge while china s has trended stronger if there s been a shock it s better to assign it to those countries than china source bespoke chinese retail sales had a good month with a beat versus estimates rising by 8 in may reversing the april sales miss industrial production remains very weak with output growing at 5 0 percent in may from a year earlier missing analysts expectations of 5 5 and well below april s 5 4 that is a 17 year low earnings observations factset research weekly update for q2 2019 the estimated earnings decline for the s p 500 is 2 5 if 2 5 is the actual decline for the quarter it will mark the first time the index has reported two straight quarters of year over year declines in earnings since q1 2016 and q2 2016 the estimated year over year revenue growth rate for q2 2019 is 3 9 if 3 9 is the actual growth rate for the quarter it will mark the lowest revenue growth rate for the index since q3 2016 2 7 nine of the eleven sectors are expected to report year over year growth in revenues led by the communication services and health care sectors two sectors are expected to report a year over year decline in revenues materials and information technology valuation the forward 12 month p e ratio for the s p 500 is 16 5 this p e ratio is equal to the 5 year average 16 5 but above the 10 year average 14 8 earnings scorecard for q2 2019 with 2 of the companies in the s p 500 reporting actual results for the quarter 2 companies have reported a positive eps surprise and 2 companies have reported a positive revenue surprise the political scene u s and mexico struck a deal after the close on friday june 7th avoiding the tariffs that many believed would send the economy into turmoil and cost america hundreds of thousands of jobs it turns out to be more of the fanatical clamoring by the media presenting their agendas and to think market participants actually sold stocks over tariffs that were never in place another example how an investor has to navigate a very difficult market backdrop in reality it is simple never jump to conclusions anyone believing corporations on both sides of the trade dispute are going to sit idly by and not look for alternative plans need to reconsider i continue to believe the entire trade issue with china has been blown way out of proportion no one has to subscribe to my theory all they need to do is take note that the s p is 2 off an all time high and the trade dispute has been going on since january 2018 the stock market may have sniffed out that much of the tariff situation being presented to investors is pure noise barron s presented another article that presents the other side of the tariff argument a position that investors need to also consider in forming a market strategy critics are now rallying around the idea that tariff man trump will go on a spree putting tariffs on anything that moves that conclusion is void of common sense there was a reason why mexico came into the tariff picture the threat of tariffs was an attempt to find a solution to the immigration issue at the border because any other solution is being shelved by congress over their differences with the administration all of the jump to conclusion investor angst was misplaced unless i missed something there are no mexican tariffs in place yet the commentary continues as if the tariffs were enacted the complaint from pundits and some investors remains we can t invest with this market backdrop perhaps market participants analysts and pundits are annoyed and taking out their frustration surrounding the tariff backdrop because they made premature decisions due to the proposals that were on the table perhaps they view this entire subject with a preconceived agenda i simply ask what are people watching the s p is 2 off an all time high in the same environment they are moaning about analysts and market participants who are crying have no one to blame but themselves they need to look in the mirror and stop blaming the situation for their mistakes and perhaps lose the agenda they bring to the table finally forget about any whirlwind earth shattering deal where both parties walk away happy and content the u s china rift over intellectual property and trade imbalances have been around for years it is simply not going to get resolved on the first attempt at negotiations the media and most of the pundits reporting this issue have the entire trade tariff story wrong the fed and global interest rates markets are now pricing in a 25 probability of a quarter point rate cut at the june meeting a 75 chance of a cut at the july 31 meeting and a 99 chance of a rate cut by year end i believe the market is overestimating the odds of a june rate cut this is the first time the fed funds market has priced in multiple fed cuts without getting one yet presidents trump and xi will meet at the g20 summit in osaka japan june 28 29 and that could easily at the very least get the trade and tariff discussions back on track all eyes were on the latest jobs report that was weaker than expected however the fed would much prefer to base a policy change on a trend rather than one data point the next labor report will be released on july 5 and that may refute the prior report or bolster the notion that rates should be lowered i believe they stay prudent no rate change in june then regroup in late july after seeing june s employment data and the status of the u s china trade negotiations i am not in the camp that says rates need to be lower to boost growth does anyone seriously think there are firms that are not investing because the fed has lifted short term rates to 2 375 a key point to see here is that rate cuts by themselves don t necessarily provide a boost to the market if the fed starts to cut rates and there is no recession in the 12 months that follow equities do well first three easing cycles source bespoke however if the fed cuts rates and the economy still contracts rate cuts haven t provided much help rate cuts are bullish outside recessions so if you are in the camp that isn t forecasting a recession there s no reason to be afraid of the market the 3 month 10 year treasury curve inverted two weeks ago and that curve remains inverted take the following for what it is worth historically an inversion in the curve has an 18 to 24 month lead time before recession furthermore in that period of time stocks have done quite well the 2 year 10 year has yet to invert source u s dept of the treasury the 2 10 spread started the year at 16 basis points it stands at 25 basis points today bespoke investment group in may investors flocked to the safety of us treasuries sending yields plummeting but this was not just a u s phenomenon the median 10 year yield for 23 countries that are tracked fell from 1 79 a month ago to 1 52 this week across these 23 countries from the first week of may to this week ten year yields fell for every country except south africa and taiwan yields have been consistently falling for most of these countries over the past year and may s further declines have brought many of them to new multi year lows notably brazil s 10 year yield fell 80 bps in may the largest decline of these countries none of the other countries saw their 10 year yield decline by nearly as much as the next largest decline was seen by india whose 10 year yield fell by less than half of that 39 bps sentiment sentimentrader reports since the inception of the s p 500 futures market there have been two time periods with this much premarket anxiety the bottom of the 2002 bear market the bottom of the 2008 bear market even while stocks rose last week the smallest of options traders were hedging they bought to open more than 3 million put options for the first time ever these types of sentiment events do not occur at market tops investor sentiment has been bearish over the past few weeks a slight change this week as the percentage of investors reporting as bulls in this week s aaii survey grew to 26 8 from 22 5 last week this week s reading is still over one standard deviation below the historical average of 38 1 crude oil and the u s dollar despite threats towards iran from the u s and claims of attacks on foreign tankers wti finished the week down 2 8 the weekly inventory report showed an increase of 2 2 million barrels at 485 5 million barrels u s crude oil inventories are now about 8 above the five year average for this time of year total motor gasoline inventories also increased by 0 8 million barrels last week and are 2 above the five year average for this time of year wti closed the week at 52 52 down 1 52 for the week the short term uptrend that has been in place for the usd appears to have been broken there may be more dollar weakness ahead or at the very least a consolidation of that move followed by sideways action the combination of an accommodative fed the bullish story for the dollar may be challenged a weaker usd will benefit u s multinationals em assets and potentially serve as a catalyst to boost commodities particularly crude oil the technical picture the rebound rally was impressive in that it wasn t just buying of the biggest losers during may there was broad participation the daily chart of the s p 500 shows the index in pause mode after a challenge to poke above the 2 900 level buyer exhaustion and the end of the rally or a simple pause that refreshes and moves stock prices higher chart courtesy of freestockcharts com when we get very close to all time highs after a rally off the lows all of the short term possibilities remain very difficult to interpret the index is consolidating above the 50 day moving average blue line as it is stuck in the resistance zone leading up to the old highs this support area might be used as a springboard to achieve a move to attack and take out the old high conversely a move back below the immediate short term opens the door for a possible retest of the early june lows no need to guess what may occur instead it will be important to concentrate on the short term pivots that are meaningful however the long term view the view 30 000 feet is the only way to make successful decisions these details are available in my daily updates to subscribers short term views are presented to give market participants a feel for the current situation it should be noted that strategic investment decisions should not be based on any short term view these views contain a lot of noise and will lead an investor into whipsaw action that tends to detract from overall performance individual stocks and sectors 58 of s p 500 stocks are currently above their 50 day moving averages source bespoke a little more than half of stocks in the tech sector are above their 50 dmas while utilities and real estate still have the strongest breadth reading by this measure it is quite obvious that many are piled into the defensive areas of the market the stock market is fickle what preoccupies it one day may be shrugged off the next short term trends ultimately amount to background noise during the long term pursuit of your financial goals yet far too many get pre occupied with the next 3 move in the s p it seems the caution lights are always on and the next bear market is right around the corner i find this commentary comical when i also see the s p 2 from an all time high because none of that is warranted now the bears are lined up just waiting to tell us when the index fails to make a new high on this rally look out below the bulls tell us when the index breaks to a new high the sky s the limit one group will be going against the long term trend and making a guess the other will default to the long term trend in place and maintain that the probabilities lean to their conclusion no one should be listening to either of those arguments in the short term as both sides will be merely speculating as to what comes next the warnings have been incessant during this entire bull market and they have been wrong who exactly are these warnings meant for it s amusing how the folks that have garnered the most gains by being correct in their strategy aren t given the benefit of doubt that they have a brain to know when it may be time to make significant portfolio changes of course there will be another bear market no one that has experienced the equity market over time will deny that however those that have remained resolute in their approach to this bull market also know that abandoning an upward trend can turn out to be big mistake the wall of worry is in place and the majority concentrates and at times obsesses over that the balance of the data is forgotten and suddenly not a part of any strategy forget all this trade angst and fed insurance talk and look at stock valuations margins revenue and profit growth s p 500 revenue estimates for 2019 and 2020 continue to be stable keeping forward revenues in record high territory industry analysts expect revenues to grow 4 9 this year and 5 3 next year if 2019 and 2020 earnings per share estimates prove correct the s p is trading at its lowest multiple in eight years the message has been to stay invested in the equity market i am now looking within the market for opportunities that have the potential to garner additional gains despite the headlines it isn t wise for investors to talk themselves into the next bear market and start making major portfolio adjustments now i would also like to take a moment and remind all of the readers of an important issue in these types of forums readers bring a host of situations and variables to the table when visiting these articles therefore it is impossible to pinpoint what may be right for each situation please keep that in mind when forming your investment strategy to all of the readers that contribute to this forum to make these articles a

children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation â remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption â temporarily â so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back â joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall â remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us â remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china â remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product â remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible â cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services â such as banking tourism and education â in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say â the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair â interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back â we rebuffed them â remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign â tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history â oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and â according to the report â tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake â cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies â herman cain and stephen moore â but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico â tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired â interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back â tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff â interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated ___

automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated ___ associated press writers eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego

washington ap in president donald trump s reckoning an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these statements range from flatly false to mostly so here s a week of political rhetoric in review iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s

well that was timely the us treasury just posted a record 207 billion deficit for may and record monthly spending of 440 billion that brought the rolling 12 month deficit to just shy of the trillion dollar mark at 986 billion the timely part is two old first it just so happens that may marked month 119 of the current expansion making it tied for the duration record with the 1990s cycle but even jm keynes himself would be rolling in his grave in light of the chart below to wit even by the lights of hardcore keynesians of yore fiscal deficits were supposed to be falling sharply at the end of a business cycle or even moving into surplus as they did in 1999 2000 not erupting toward 5 of gdp as has now happened the second timely note of sorts is that the wall street journal was johnny on the spot this am with a front page story entitled how washington learned to love debt and deficits the story s quote from the current dem chairman of the house budget committee john yarmouth says it all there simply has never been such bipartisan complacency about the nation s public finances in all of modern history including during the biggest borrow and spend days of fdr lbj and every president since gerald ford rep john yarmuth d ky house budget committee chairman says he rarely hears from constituents concerned about rising deficits and debt many voters attitudes he says there haven t been any cataclysmic consequences so why worry about it the wsj story is a dog s breakfast of rationalizations non sequitirs political double talk and keynesian tommyrot what is the most telling however is that it was co authored by jon hilsenrath who was the paper s longtime fed reporter yet it contains not a single word about the role of central banks in fostering the utter collapse of fiscal responsibility described by his lengthy report peak trump the undrai david a stockman best price 12 72 buy new 43 07 as of 11 40 utc details so for want of doubt here is the culprit the central banks of the world have expanded their balance sheets by upwards of 22 trillion since the turn of the century thereby massively monetizing the erupting public debt of the us and most of the world via fiat credit snatched from thin air so did that massive 22 trillion buy order from the central banks weigh heavily on the supply of funds side of the scales in the fixed income market thereby driving bond prices skyward and yields ever lower why goodness gracious yes it did the chart below drops the dime on the 22 trillion elephant in the room yet the current worldwide regime of keynesian central banking has so corrupted both financial discourse and pricing in the bond pits that this central bank balance sheet explosion is treated as inert financial wallpaper utterly irrelevant to the whys and wherefores of daily action on both ends of the acela corridor combined global central bank balance sheets moreover the entire system is so mired in the fantasy called debt doesn t matter both public and private that we get the chart below apparently not a single one of the hundreds of high paid wall street analysts who cover or strategize on the fixed income markets came within a country mile of guessing where the 10 year ust yield would be today in their start of the year projections that is as of january they were essentially blind deaf and dumb as to what would materialize in a mere 180 days and the utterly hideous level of forecast error shown below is not due to the fact that the trade war and global growth outlook have deteriorated since the beginning of the year here s why wall street jabber about emerging macroeconomic weakness does not explain the above chart all things being equal in an honest financial system of course the bond market might well price in modestly lower bond yields in the face of an expected or actual recession the reason would be reduced demand especially from business and consumers for credit but that shouldn t happen in today s world because government borrowing explodes during a recession by a far larger magnitude than any offsetting reduction in demand for business working capital credit or long term debt and households are so extended that use of credit barely declines at all for instance during the financial crisis and great recession the rate of federal borrowing soared from 161 billion in fy 2007 to 1 4 trillion in fy 2009 in cumulative terms federal debt outstanding on the eve of the crisis in september 2007 was 5 994 trillion and by the time the worst of the recession had passed in september 2009 the figure was 8 616 trillion so on the basis of honest finance uncle sam alone absorbed 2 622 trillion of private savings during that two year period but unlike the theory household and business borrowings did not go down in fact the debts of non financial businesses corporate and noncorporate actually rose from 9 845 trillion in september 2007 to 10 387 trillion two years later representing a gain of 542 billion likewise total household debt barely budged notwithstanding the massive mortgage foreclosures which occurred during this period to wit household debt of 14 03 trillion in september 2007 had dipped to 13 96 trillion by september 2009 representing a tiny 65 billion decline 0 5 decline the great deformation david a stockman best price 2 00 buy new 9 95 as of 09 55 utc details in sum us treasury demand for funds rose by 2 62 trillion during the 2007 2009 recessionary decline but private household and business demand also rose by a net of 474 billion there was no weakening of demand for borrowings at all meaning the theory that private demand for borrowings falls during a recessionary downturn is belied by the relevant facts from the last go round whatever may have been the case back in the keynesian heydays of the 1960s and 1970s is no longer relevant that s because the american economy is now entombed in 72 trillion of public and private debt upon which the daily turning of the economic wheels vitally depend accordingly households have not de levered since the 2008 2009 crisis with total outstanding debt now posting at a record 15 7 trillion and business debt has veritably soared by 58 to 15 6 trillion so the questions recurs why were analysts so far off the mark on bond yields just six months ago and why has the 10 year yield collapsed from 3 24 on november 8 last fall to just 2 096 at today s close that s a whopping 35 decline in the yield in the face of only a mild markdown of the economic outlook and it is occurring under financial conditions which have not improved at all from the last recession when there was no decline in private sector debt at all stated differently if the bond market was actually discounting an impending recession under current financial conditions yields would be going up because federal borrowing is certain to soar and private demand is virtually guaranteed to remain constant or probably rise as per 2007 2009 needless to say all things are not equal and the bond market does not trade any of the facts cited above what it trades is the fed and the other central banks and it is now pricing in a biblical flood of new liquidity that is expected to monetize the 1 5 to 2 0 trillion federal deficits that are sure to emerge during the upcoming recession and to do so without any crowding out of the now massive 31 2 trillion mountain of household and nonfinancial business debt but here s the thing the implicit assumption that indefinite and virtually infinite levels of public debt can be monetized can t be true nor can the implicit assumption that the real yield on the 10 year bond can remain at virtually zero it was 0 09 today for the indefinite future with no harm no foul consequences after all that amounts to one epic free lunch proposition namely that no one needs to save or defer gratification in the private sector because the central banks can always print enough new credit to monetize the public debt and keep interest rates aberrantly and irrationally low the truth is massive central bank monetization of the debt has essentially pulled the plug on fiscal management as underscored by today s wall street journal story but in so doing it is also setting up the system for a thundering day of reckoning a hint of that can be seen in the chart below which tracks net national savings the latter is the real mccoy among savings measures because it subtracts today s massive and chronic public sector dis savings i e deficits from the meager level of positive savings generated by households and undistributed corporate profits it therefore shows what s left for net investment in the private sector and the current answer is not much in fact net national savings in q1 2019 was just 506 billion at an annual rate incredibly that figure is 26 below the 681 billion rate recorded in q1 of 1999 and it s also stated in nominal dollars adjusted for the 46 rise in the gdp deflator since 1999 today s net national savings level stands at 340 billion 1999 or 50 below where it was exactly 20 years ago in a word the radically artificial bond rates that have been generated by massive central bank debt monetization have fostered the foolish belief in the imperial city that the public debt is benign and that borrowing a trillion dollars at the tippy top of the business cycle is no sweat at all in truth it has led to a financial metastasis down below the surface to wit america has been eating its seed corn private savings to fund the most irresponsible spree of fiscal excess in recorded history the public debt has gone from 5 5 trillion to 22 trillion during that 20 year period and after 30 years based on current built in policy the public debt will be 42 trillion or nearly 8x higher stated differently today as the economy struggles to grow after the longest weakest business expansion ever the private economy has 50 less in real terms to invest in future productivity and growth than it had two decades ago and this is occurring at the worst possible moment in history that is on the eve of the tsunami of baby boom retirements which will hit 11 600 per day by 2022 and 80 million social security medicare beneficiaries by the end of the 2020s what is worse the central bankers and their keynesian apologists who are responsible for this impending catastrophe have become actual debt deniers claiming there is plenty of savings elsewhere in the world to cover america s fiscal profligacy thus the longtime head of the new york fed and goldman sach s plenipotentiary at the central bank is quoted by the wsj as saying nothing to sweat here there are plenty of savings around the world to be invested says former federal reserve bank of new york president william dudley what he is suggesting is that apparently the prudent folks in the rest of the world have not followed the us pattern and have increased their savings rates to compensate and once more are happy to send their hard earned savings stateside to earn hardly a pittance after inflation and currency risk in fact it is even more ludicrous at the moment after adjusting for the cost of currency hedges mrs watanabe in japan would be earning a negative return on today s 2 096 treasury rate perhaps the people of japan are secretly paying america reparations for world war ii that would be as good an explanation as any were not the entire global fixed income market in complete breakdown owing to the depredations of central banks in fact we are now apparently at near an all time high of negative yielding debt at 11 trillion on a worldwide basis so indeed somewhere on the planet there must be some kind of massive pool of stranded excess savings lapping this stuff up in order help the governments of the world make ends meet except there isn t the alleged savings glut was invented by bernanke and b dud bill dudley and it is one of the proverbial big lies most of the developed world economies in fact have experienced a net national savings rate decline which looks exactly like that of the us relative to gdp it has been heading south for decades and now stands at barely one fourth of the level that prevailed during the growth heydays of the 1960s in the case of japan for instance its net household savings rate has plummeted from 12 14 of disposable income as recently as the mid 1980s to barely 2 0 today the image below hardly suggests that the world largest retirement colony has got a surfeit of savings to spare or take the case of australia just since 2008 the household savings rate has fallen more than 50 with respect to the major european economies the story is the same since the mid 1980s the savings rate in the uk red line and italy dark green line has virtually disappeared likewise in the case of france light green line and germany yellow line savings rates have drifted steadily lower albeit not so precipitately as the first two so where does all the purported excess savings come from why the red ponzi of course but even that is a statistical trick owing to the keynesian assumptions built into the national income and product accounts nipa to wit since the late 1990s china s total debt outstanding has exploded from 2 trillion to 40 trillion and that massive gain has been cycled back into the economy to fund its runaway investment in public infrastructure and private industry in the first round of accounting all of that new debt fuels wage and salary income and business profits but alas there is no offset in the nipa accounts for the permanent liability which funded these gdp account entries so presto a savings glut if you believe it unfortunately the politicians of washington and the punters of wall street apparently do reprinted

an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these statements range from flatly false to mostly so here s a week of political rhetoric in review iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated ___ associated press writers eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego tom krisher in

powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego tom krisher in detroit and jon gambrell in dubai

he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the

ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___

getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two

clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated associated press writers eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san

published sunday 16 june 2019 print disqus by doug casey international man for many years president trump has made no apologies for trying to pay the least amount of taxes possible he s clearly stated this in many interviews his desire to minimize his taxes has brought scorn from many in the mainstream media and politicians from both sides of the aisle these people are of the opinion that paying taxes is an honorable and necessary responsibility it brings to mind the wrongheaded saying taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society which came from us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes many people believe this but if that s true how come low tax locales like singapore the cayman islands monaco aren t backward hell holes but rather sophisticated and civilized doug casey almost any lie can be accepted as truth if it s said often enough and with enough certainty that absolutely applies to what holmes said it s shameful how people don t think about its meaning but slavishly repeat it taxes aren t the price we pay for civilized society they re a sign of the fact that society is becoming uncivilized a civilized society is based on voluntarism taxes are all about coercion people don t seem to recognize or remember that before 1913 there was no income tax in the us there was no reporting of any kind to the us government it was a much more civilized and far freer country then as far as trump minimizing his taxes congratulations to him the object should be to cut the size of the us government in half and cut it in half again and again and along with it cut the tax burden that it imposes on the average american trump should be proud of himself for cutting his taxes it s your patriotic duty as an american citizen to deny revenue to the state and the kind of people that are drawn to it and populate it the fact that some people resent others for not paying taxes is just evidence that they ve been consumed by the vice of envy which is one of the worst of the vices jealousy says if you have something that i want i ll try to take it from you just because i want it envy says if you have something that i want and i can t take it from you i ll destroy it and hurt you it s speaks poorly of the ethics of the average american that they ll self righteously shame their neighbors for not paying enough taxes to the state international man we often hear from politicians and the media that some people aren t paying their fair share in taxes who gets to define what fair is and based on what justifications doug casey whenever you hear the word fair start running the other way everybody has a different idea of what s fair it s an arbitrary concept people manipulate its definition to their advantage the only way to determine what might be fair is voluntary mutual agreement that s not possible with taxes there s no voluntarism involved they are in fact a levy enforced at the point of a gun the most creative and productive people tend to have the highest incomes unless they re crony capitalists which means they re basically using the government to steal from everybody else productive people shouldn t be penalized for supplying more goods and services to their neighbors to the market the money they give to the government in taxes would have otherwise been used to create more wealth for the whole world when it s taken from them by taxes it s mostly squandered on welfare and warfare the bottom half of the us really doesn t pay any income tax they only pay social security taxes roughly a flat 15 it s theoretically a pension program although in fact it s a ponzi scheme social security is bankrupt if anyone gets it in the years to come it will be at the expense of future taxpayers not because any capital has been set aside social security is and always has been a swindle it makes it harder for people to save on their own and makes them feel they don t have to but it s not a real pension plan it s a highly politicized welfare program people have been propagandized into believing not just what isn t true but actually believing the opposite of the truth the situation is actually pretty hopeless from a philosophical point of view and it s getting worse the average american believes social security and the income tax are both moral and necessary international man doesn t this system which diverts wealth from productive use into government which is naturally unproductive make everyone worse off you would think the lower and middle classes would be clamoring for more wealth creation that would also benefit them instead many are asking for more wealth to be destroyed it seems this sort of thinking helps solidify a backwards system doug casey absolutely the us government and its welfare programs are actually cementing the lower classes to the bottom of society you get what you encourage when you give people free money for doing nothing that s what they ll do take personal responsibility away from a man and he ll tend to act irresponsibly the next step seems to be a guaranteed annual income for everybody where presumably where everybody can just sit around starbucks all day sipping latte and playing with their iphones and be paid for it this trend has been building almost 100 years and the curve is starting to go parabolic to use a fashionable word it s unsustainable for everyone to try living at the expense of everyone else international man another misnomer we often hear is that deficits don t matter a saying popularized by dick cheney an ostensible fiscal conservative doug casey well deficits do matter in order to become wealthy you have to produce more than you consume and save the difference saving the difference builds capital and you need capital to create more wealth countries without capital are poor places like zimbabwe cuba and mauritania the only capital they have is sticks and stones the us government is in effect training people to consume more than they produce now you can do that in basically two ways one by borrowing capital that s been saved and created in the past and consuming it or two you can do it by mortgaging your future it s not a pro survival policy to consume more than you produce it s possible for a while of course but will wind up in disaster the us government is encouraging people to do just that however directly and indirectly international man yet another misguided yet popular saying is that we shouldn t worry about the national debt because we owe it to ourselves what s your take doug doug casey it s another glib gigantic lie we don t owe it to ourselves some people owe it to some other people if it s not paid back somebody is going to walk away disappointed in fact most of the debt is owed to non americans directly in the form of the national debt and indirectly in the form of us dollars outside the us for many years the major export of the us hasn t been boeings or ibms or wheat it s been us dollars we run a trade deficit of about 800 billion every year in exchange foreigners send us electronics mercedes cocaine and other real goods this has artificially propped up the average american s standard of living those dollars circulate in other countries the us dollar is the de facto currency of 50 other countries around the world at some point since the us dollar is backed by nothing if confidence goes away those foreigners are going to want to get rid of their dollars they ll necessarily come back to the us where legal tender laws force americans to accept them there are many trillions of dollars that are now abroad are a liability someday they re going to be traded for us shares of stock us real estate us technology and us labor americans who have grown accustomed to an artificially high standard of living for many years are going to have a very real drop in their standard of living when those dollars come home we re sending dollars to the chinese and other foreigners we re also selling us government debt to the federal reserve which then credits the government s accounts at commercial banks with dollars but that s another story it s all a moving paper fantasy it s going to end badly and end soon it could easily destroy everybody s savings and that in turn could destroy the very basis of society editor s note the days of the us dollar as the reserve currency are numbered when that happens the us will experience an economic crisis unlike we ve seen before the window to prepare yourself is still open that s why doug s casey and his team have created this urgent video on what to expect and how to protect yourself click here to watch it now doug casey digg this article published sunday 16 june 2019 e mail print source goldseek com please enable javascript to view the comments

zhou xiaochuan former governor of the people s bank of china speaks during the 11th lujiazui forum 2019 in shanghai june 14 2019 efforts are needed to avoid a worldwide competitive devaluation of currencies triggered by trade frictions said zhou xiaochuan former governor of the people s bank of china speaking at the two day lujiazui forum which attracted government business and academic leaders from home and abroad and ended on friday in shanghai zhou said the nonprofit financial stability board which monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system should help avoid such a devaluation thereby giving a more positive signal to the global financial market the issue is timely given the approach of the g20 osaka summit on june 28 and 29 he said zhou said trade problems will again trigger competitive devaluations as in the last global financial crisis he said fiscal and central bank regulators of different countries reached an earlier consensus to make joint efforts to avoid competitive devaluation there is no winner if a trade war is waged the world s exchange rates will confront fluctuations and the entire financial order will be chaotic if every country adopts competitive devaluation he said competitive devaluation is a series of sudden currency depreciations between two national currencies as a result of tit for tat moves to gain an edge in international export markets in 2016 the international monetary fund asked its member countries to refrain from all forms of protectionism and competitive devaluations zhou further warned that every country s gdp will contract though at different levels if there is a trade war in that case economic regulators will adopt more active or expansionary fiscal and currency policies to address the side effects of an economic slowdown he said but trade losses cannot be directly offset by adjusting macroeconomic policies creating a global predicament he said in the short term countries should turn to fundamentally addressing trade tensions such as putting the world trade order back on track via trade talks and world trade organization reform he said for china there should be more favorable export policies to find new markets and build new outlets to make up for the affected exports to the united states china s exports are of good quality and reasonable prices we have seen from the experience of the last financial crisis that chinese exporters have enough flexibility and resilience with policy incentives chinese exporters will find new markets within two or three years time he said paul romer co recipient of the 2018 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences said that there might be some short term volatility from trade tensions but china has always coped with large fluctuations well and is sure to do the same vice premier liu he said at forum s opening on thursday that china s long term positive economic growth will not be altered and there is still a huge amount of room for development in its macroeconomy china has confidence to face any challenges he said

the shipbuilding industry was dealt a huge blow by the global economic crisis in 2008 when vessel demand decreased dragging down prices and shortening orderbook covers over the following seven years currently huge over capacity is still looming over shipbuilding most shipyards globally have struggled to recover from the 2008 fallout and very few are actually operating profitably says maritime analyst and team leader of ihs s ship new construction department robert willmington despite big fluctuations in price and demand the major markets china japan and south korea remain at the forefront of the global shipbuilding and ship repair industry together comprising approximately 89 of the market share however a group of countries in southeast asia are emerging as competitors with the financial backing of their governments a healthy dose of foreign investment due to lower labour costs scheduled infrastructure developments and business friendly regulations southeast asian countries are currently securing some of the biggest deals in the shipbuilding industry philippines high growth and high hopes the philippines has been steadily rising as one of the top shipbuilding centres since 2010 when it first outstripped the european market to join the industry s high ranks as the fourth biggest shipbuilding hub in the world how well do you really know your competitors access the

shipbuilding is the philippines willmington says clearly the philippines continues to outshine all other south eastern countries and i see no reason for this to change in the near future at the start of 2015 it was announced that the philippines largest shipyard hhic phil s subic facility had registered over 5bn in sales since full capacity operations began in 2009 unanswered questions at the nicaragua canal the 50bn nicaragua canal scheme promises to bring huge economic benefits to central america s poorest country hhic also has a relatively full orderbook up to 2017 and has orders in hand for post panamax boxships very large crude carriers and lpg tankers willmington says on 21 april a contract between hanjin heavy industries and cma cgm france s biggest shipping company revealed that the philippines will be building three of the world s largest container vessels at subic the 20 000 teu ships are planned to be delivered by the second half of 2017 currently operating a total of around 121 shipyards across its territory the philippines is predicted to produce over 4 8 million in ship gross tonnage between 2015 and 2018 the most in southeast asia i believe longer term that the philippines could grow its presence significantly should other foreign shipbuilders choose to locate production there willmington says the country has a significant relatively low cost labour pool which has excellent maritime expertise in addition local governments are keen to encourage foreign direct investment to boost domestic employment levels the country s central government also seems to be favouring the industry s growth shipping and shipbuilding are listed in the philippines 2012 investment priorities plan according to marina the filipino maritime industry authority the shipbuilding sector benefits from a number of tax exemptions as well as investment incentives to domestic shipbuilding and ship repair sectors some drawbacks remain in september 2014 maritime expert and offshore solutions unlimited president thomas s wissmann highlighted some of the major challenges facing the philippines shipbuilding industry these include a high number of imported vessels and maritime materials non compliance with environmental and hse standards and lack of modern shipbuilding and ship repair sbsr facilities however as the country is registering strong growth in gdp the shipbuilding market is expected to develop further work is in progress on 87 vessels and additional deliveries are scheduled over the next three years singapore southeast asia s specialist shipbuilder singapore dominates the market when it comes to the construction of customised and specialised vessels such as offshore support and supply vessels dredgers yachts and research vessels in 2013 nationwide ship repair and conversion generated 3 5bn in turnover according to the association of singapore marine industries asmi while the shipbuilding sector attracted a further 631m singapore is currently setting the grounds for a big yard expansion according to an industry directory engineering group sembcorp marine is investing in a mammoth new facility in tuas west singapore the future 206ha shipyard will integrate sembcorp s shipbuilding ship repair and offshore engineering operations into a single unit and it will become singapore s largest shipyard on completion in 2024 most shipyards globally have struggled to recover from the 2008 fallout and very few are actually operating profitably until then high profit contracts are securing the country s position as a preferred niche ship manufacturer on 22 april a sembcorp owned shipyard secured a 41m conversion contract for transforming a shuttle tanker into a floating storage and offloading vessel at sembawang shipyard on singapore s north coast although singapore is currently exposed to the offshore sector which is in a period of significant over supply according to willmington research published by asmi forecast an increasing global demand for specialist vessels this could be highly beneficial to the singaporean shipbuilding market which is currently set to produce over 800 000 tonnes in gross tonnage over the next three years malaysia s strategic position malaysia is strategically positioned for an increased demand of sbsr and much like the philippines the country s 120 registered shipyards are aided by exemptions from import duty and sales tax three years ago the malaysian government introduced its shipbuilding ship repair strategic plan 2020 designed to boost malaysia s industrial competitiveness in the maritime industry and generate just over 6bn in turnover the economic plan announced malaysia s ambition to control 2 of the global shipbuilding industry by 2020 keeping realistic the association of marine industries of malaysia amim president and chairman tan sri ahmad ramli mohd nor said the country would focus on the production of small and medium sized vessels of up to 30 000 tonnes to meet its targets of a 10 industry growth rate before 2020 the malaysian industry government group for high technology and amim have put in place a number of incentivising strategies such as training skilled workers strengthening the institutional framework and introducing business friendly policies since the plan was presented in 2011 a number of developments have already been implemented for example shipbuilder boustead heavy industries corp initiated new designs for offshore support vessels that would incorporate environmentally friendly technology the prototype for these new ships will be built starting 2016 another initiative is the deepening of the kuala baram basin and the clean up of polluted waters in the area in order to allow the development of new shipyards in march malaysia based offshore support vessel builder nam cheong struck a 58m deal for building vessels set for delivery between 2015 and 2016 this pushed malaysia s current orderbook to a robust 458m according to nam cheong ceo leong seng keat contango market brings risks and rewards as tanker firms react to a low oil price with the price of brent crude remaining low oil tanker operators are taking advantage of contango market conditions but like singapore malaysia is also exposed to the over supplied offshore sector which is why a high proportion of the malaysian orderbook has been delayed we see significant opportunity for order cancellations during 2015 willmington predicts indonesia shipbuilding revival on the horizon indonesia s struggling shipping and shipbuilding industry has been yearning for a clear government initiated development plan especially after the blow of the 2008 downturn and overtonnaging issues at the beginning of 2015 a number of shipbuilding insiders were deploring indonesia s shipbuilding business as stagnant due to the local preference to import ships rather than manufacture them locally indonesia is also potentially in a difficult position with heavy exposure to the offshore sector however it benefits from regular orders from the indonesian government for patrol vessels and intra island ferries explains willmington confidence in the industry s future received a boost with the election of president joko widodo in october 2014 the centrepiece of his electoral campaign was the vow to develop and strengthen indonesia s maritime sector and to turn it into a global maritime axis the jakarta globe reported in january 2015 that at the time high costs of production meant that indonesian vessels were 30 more expensive than their chinese equivalents market regulation and the country s tax framework were also reported as counter productive to the construction and export of ships the situation seems to be changing the country s shipyards and shipbuilding associations welcomed widodo s 292 5m investment into building freight and passenger ships as part of his maritime highway initiative announced early 2015 clear targets for the development of the country s shipbuilding industry took shape in the indonesian ministry of industry 2012 2025 plan one aim of the plan is to produce vessels with a capacity of 200 000 tonnes deadweight by 2020 although the shipyard business is blighted by tariffs that add 25 to production costs with increased pressure from industry groups the government is taking steps to remove the tariffs on imported ship components throughout the country at the moment the shipbuilding core is in the batam free trade zone concentrating over 70 shipyards an industrial area free from import tax and vat furthermore in april this year china announced its interest in investing a total of 63bn in indonesian infrastructure in particular chinese investors would spend 10 9bn on shipyard estates all these incentives are fuelling hope for a strong revival of the country s shipbuilding and ship repair industry in indonesia vietnam leaving the past behind currently in the middle of a shipbuilding industry restructure vietnam is set to rise from its murky maritime past the vietnamese government which had high hopes for vietnam to become a leading shipbuilding nation in the 2000s via state intervention has more or less dropped out of global shipbuilding willmington explains we see significant opportunity for order cancellations during 2015 in 2010 vinashin one of vietnam s leading shipbuilders went bankrupt under a debt of 4 5bn in the middle of a mismanagement scandal the state owned portion of vietnamese shipbuilding was more or less devastated by the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis however foreign direct owned shipyards have more often than not benefitted due to the ability to gain lower labour costs than in their domestic markets vinashin since renamed the shipbuilding industry corporation has been broken up and fully restructured from within by the government on 12 april vietnam s minister of transport dinh la thang announced that although the company has now largely recovered from its fall further restructuring will take place it now aims to achieve sales of 333m in 2015 despite the fact that a high proportion of vietnam s existing orderbook has been postponed however hyundai mipo hmd of south korea continues to support its joint venture shipyard in vietnam says willmington known as hyundai vinashin this yard has a healthy orderbook for vessels allocated to it by hmd in november 2014 the ministry of transport announced a cooperative plan between vietnam and japan to develop vietnam s shipbuilding industry by 2020 with a further vision for 2030 the primary objectives of the next five years are to develop the capabilities of current shipbuilding and ship repair units and also develop new ones to meet market demand both domestic and foreign concerning ship repair the plan aims to introduce environmentally friendly technology that would accommodate work on 300 000 tonne ships to achieve this the number of shipyards will decrease but they will be consolidated into larger more efficient establishments reaching out to foreign investors vietnam s dong a shipbuilding joint stock company recently entered a 175m

trying to establish ontario s place in the canadian federation s politics presents a paradox critically important ontario cast 37 per cent of all votes in 2015 contributing 80 of the liberals 184 constituencies however having elected a small l liberal prime minister that year the same province proceeded less than three years later to select the conservative doug ford as premier justin trudeau introduces a carbon tax while ford leads a charge against it going so far as to enact legislation to require stickers on gas pumps denouncing the tax trying to get a fix on ontario s prevailing ideological winds is no easy task ontario was governed by a progressive version of conservatism in the 60s and 70s when premiers such as john robarts and bill davis quite compatible with the era of trudeau the elder held office take education as an example the pcs of that era invested prodigious resources in all levels of education particularly post secondary it would pay off economically toronto s current prosperity is directly connected to those investments as a producer with cbc s the journal in 1985 i made a short documentary profile of a small high tech firm in toronto that had just sold its new design system for cars to gm why in toronto ceo stephen bingham said that the staff s advanced technical skills were attributable to investments by bill davis in places like the universities of toronto and waterloo and sheridan college however a new hard edged conservatism took over in progressive conservative mike harris years of the 90s enthusiastic about cutting education spending prioritizing tax cuts deep cuts to postsecondary were offset to some degree by tuition increases and private sector support particularly for elite universities such as toronto and waterloo those years featured strong economic growth imported from a boom south of the border dubbed by economist joseph stiglitz the roaring nineties and aided by a continuously declining canadian dollar that fell from the moment the pcs took office from about 72 cents u s to 62 5 cents in january 2002 conservatives liked to think the growth was about them and harris common sense revolution it was not the dalton mcguinty liberals would reverse the anti education policies of harris along the way they earned kudos from the organisation for economic co operation and development for their reforms but under mcguinty taxes did not rise much marking a key political and ideological success for the harris conservatives spending remained low in part by significantly postponing outlays for public services such as chronic care mainstream media misleadingly portray ontario s debt and spending when doug ford became premier succeeding the seemingly progressive kathleen wynne cap and trade research on guaranteed basic income changes to the sex education curriculum ontario had the lowest per capita program spending of any province this was despite the left of centre image cultivated by wynne ontario s government had and still has low overall revenues per person a tribute to the tax cutting fervour of the harris years many spending pressures such as daycare remain unmet canada s largely conservative print media has misleadingly portrayed ontario as a high spending debt ridden basket case the truth is that spending and taxes remain low the latter being a key contributor to debt itself primarily a product of the financial downturn following the last recession while per capita ontario s debt is higher than that of most other provinces it is not the largest in canada and there is no crisis it is not always true that as pundits and journalists often say ontarians like to choose one party for queen s park and send another to power in ottawa the historical record is largely coincidence but it is true that federal provincial political dynamics matter a deeply unpopular provincial regime can harm the prospects of its federal counterpart a clear and present danger for andrew scheer evidence accumulates that some of doug ford s actions unpopular cuts to treatment of autistic children increasing high school class sizes slashing public health spending rollbacks to local flood fighting capacity and to libraries are taking a deep toll on ford s popularity polling by pollara ipsos mainstreet and corbett communications report a significant drop in public support for the ford government a recent analysis prepared by eric grenier of cbc suggests ford is beginning to cost the federal conservatives significant support i suspect that come autumn it will likely determine the winner of the federal election simply because ontario is so big to date my assessment is that ford s woes have cost scheer s federal conservatives relatively little however i think doug ford s political problems are just getting started the cost to andrew scheer is likely to get worse and there is another federal provincial dynamic at work in ontario just as many of justin trudeau s senior personnel such as gerald butts and katie telford were imported from queen s park political circles ford has surrounded himself with former harper government staffers jenni byrne who was for a time ford s principal secretary and is now a member of the ontario energy board was also stephen harper s principal secretary politics defined by regions one key to the paradox of ontario is that with a population of 15 million it is too large to have a single political culture in the centre is toronto liberal stronghold political home to key trudeau ministers such as finance minister bill morneau and foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland toronto s suburbs better known by its area code 905 harbour considerable conservative strength the ambiguity of ontario s outlook seems rooted here mostly pc in the 2018 provincial election but heavily liberal in 2015 the region is the political home of jane philpott of snc lavalin scandal fame who now plans to run there as an independent with almost no hope of success as for the snc lavalin affair it is unclear what impact it might have scandals past have generated headlines but had little impact on votes meanwhile the southwest including london and windsor with the exception of tech centre kitchener waterloo experienced post recession some of the manufacturing stagnation characteristic of neighbouring american states that bred discontent although even in that region recovery has taken hold there is longer term stagnation in ontario s north also home to a large indigenous population politically the north is a relative stronghold for the ndp eastern ontario is a rural sea of small c conservatism except for kingston and metropolitan ottawa justin trudeau s father pierre trudeau won three majorities in the elections of 1968 1974 and 1980 in between he had a near miss in 1972 winning one more seat than robert stanfield s tories but continued to govern propped up by the ndp and in 1979 suffered a loss to joe clark who led a short lived minority government which pierre trudeau handily defeated early in 1980 a key difference between the pierre trudeau liberal majorities and their poor results in 1972 and 1979 was fickle ontario canada s largest province was charmed by the trudeau mystique in 1968 and 1974 but deeply disappointed in 72 and 79 having been weakened by scandal history may repeat itself for trudeau the younger in 2019 a potential key difference ontario s provincial politics played no role in the elections of the 70s by all appearances that is not going to be true this year paul barber is a political analyst and journalist living in toronto he has worked for cbc television notably the now defunct daily program the journal and as a policy expert for the ontario government barber currently blogs at tcnorris this story is a revised and updated version of an article originally published as part of a longer piece in the print magazine inroads the canadian journal of opinion in it several contributors assess prospects in their regions for the forthcoming federal election the story is also available online at tcnorris
zhou xiaochuan former governor of the people s bank of china speaks during the 11th lujiazui forum 2019 in shanghai june 14 2019 efforts are needed to avoid a worldwide competitive devaluation of currencies triggered by trade frictions said zhou xiaochuan former governor of the people s bank of china speaking at the two day lujiazui forum which attracted government business and academic leaders from home and abroad and ended on friday in shanghai zhou said the nonprofit financial stability board which monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system should help avoid such a devaluation thereby giving a more positive signal to the global financial market the issue is timely given the approach of the g20 osaka summit on june 28 and 29 he said zhou said trade problems will again trigger competitive devaluations as in the last global financial crisis he said fiscal and central bank regulators of different countries reached an earlier consensus to make joint efforts to avoid competitive devaluation there is no winner if a trade war is waged the world s exchange rates will confront fluctuations and the entire financial order will be chaotic if every country adopts competitive devaluation he said competitive devaluation is a series of sudden currency depreciations between two national currencies as a result of tit for tat moves to gain an edge in international export markets in 2016 the international monetary fund asked its member countries to refrain from all forms of protectionism and competitive devaluations zhou further warned that every country s gdp will contract though at different levels if there is a trade war in that case economic regulators will adopt more active or expansionary fiscal and currency policies to address the side effects of an economic slowdown he said but trade losses cannot be directly offset by adjusting macroeconomic policies creating a global predicament he said in the short term countries should turn to fundamentally addressing trade tensions such as putting the world trade order back on track via trade talks and world trade organization reform he said for china there should be more favorable export policies to find new markets and build new outlets to make up for the affected exports to the united states china s exports are of good quality and reasonable prices we have seen from the experience of the last financial crisis that chinese exporters have enough flexibility and resilience with policy incentives chinese exporters will find new markets within two or three years time he said paul romer co recipient of the 2018 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences said that there might be some short term volatility from trade tensions but china has always coped with large fluctuations well and is sure to do the same vice premier liu he said at forum s opening on thursday that china s long term positive economic growth will not be altered and there is still a huge amount of room for development in its macroeconomy china has confidence to face any challenges he said
across the advanced economies monetary and fiscal policymakers lack the tools needed to respond to another major downturn and financial crisis worse while the world no longer needs to worry about a hawkish us federal reserve strangling growth it now has an even bigger problem on its hands new york last summer my colleague brunello rosa and i identified ten potential downside risks that could trigger a us and global recession in 2020 nine of them are still in play today many involve the united states trade wars with china and other countries along with restrictions on migration foreign direct investment and technology transfers could have profound implications for global supply chains raising the threat of stagflation slowing growth alongside rising inflation and the risk of a us growth slowdown has become more acute now that the stimulus from the 2017 tax legislation has run its course meanwhile us equity markets have remained frothy since our initial commentary and there are added risks associated with the rise of newer forms of debt including in many emerging markets where much borrowing is denominated in foreign currencies with central banks ability to serve as lenders of last resort increasingly constrained illiquid financial markets are vulnerable to flash crashes and other disruptions one such disruption could come from us president donald trump who may be tempted to create a foreign policy crisis wag the dog with a country like iran that might bolster his domestic poll numbers but it could also trigger an oil shock beyond the us the fragility of growth in debt ridden china and some other emerging markets remains a concern as do economic policy financial and political risks in europe worse across the advanced economies the policy toolbox for responding to a crisis remains limited the monetary and fiscal interventions and private sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today the tenth factor that we considered was the us federal reserve s interest rate policy after hiking rates in response to the trump administration s pro cyclical fiscal stimulus the fed reversed course in january looking ahead the fed and other major central banks are more likely to cut rates to manage various shocks to the global economy while trade wars and potential oil spikes constitute a supply side risk they also threaten aggregate demand and thus consumption growth because tariffs and higher fuel prices reduce disposable income with so much uncertainty companies will likely opt to reduce capital spending and investment subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now under these conditions a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 compared to 5 25 in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing qe central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and as rosa and i argued last year financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments among the risks that could trigger a recession in 2020 the sino american trade and technology war deserves special attention the conflict could escalate further in several ways the trump administration could decide to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese exports not yet affected or prohibiting huawei and other chinese firms from using us components could trigger a full scale process of de globalization as companies scramble to secure their supply chains were that to happen china would have several options for retaliating against the us such as by closing its market to us multinationals like apple under such a scenario the shock to markets around the world would be sufficient to bring on a global crisis regardless of what the major central banks do with the current tensions already denting business consumer and investor confidence and slowing global growth further escalation would tip the world into a recession and given the scale of private and public debt another financial crisis would likely follow from that both trump and chinese president xi jinping know that it is in their countries interest to avoid a global crisis so they have an incentive to find a compromise in the next few months yet both sides are still ratcheting up nationalist rhetoric and pursuing tit for tat measures trump and xi each seem to think that his country s long term economic and national security may depend on his not blinking in the face of a new cold war and if they each genuinely believe the other will blink first the risk of a ruinous clash is high indeed it is possible that trump and xi will meet for talks during the g20 summit on june 28 29 in osaka but even if they do agree to restart negotiations a comprehensive deal to settle their many points of contention would be a long way off as the two sides drift further apart the space for compromise is shrinking and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile global economy is rising

u s retail sales increased in may and sales for the prior month were revised higher suggesting a pick up in consumer spending that eased fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter the fairly upbeat report from the commerce department on friday followed a raft of weak data including a step down in hiring in may and tame inflation readings that have led economists to believe that the federal reserve will signal a rate cut later this year when policymakers meet next week financial markets have priced in two rate cuts this year driven primarily by a recent escalation in the trade war between the united states and china which economists have warned could undercut economic growth the economy will next month celebrate 10 years of expansion the longest in history don t count this economy out yet the consumer is saying as they show the way by opening their wallets and purses to spend the money that makes the economy hum said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york retail sales rose 0 5 last month as households bought more motor vehicles and a variety of other goods the government said data for april was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0 3 instead of dropping 0 2 as previously reported there were also increases in purchases of building materials and garden equipment furniture and electronics and appliances americans also spent more on online and mail order purchases hobbies music and books as well as at bars and restaurants but sales at clothing stores were unchanged economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0 6 in may compared to may last year sales advanced 3 2 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales climbed 0 5 last month after an upwardly revised 0 4 rise in april these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have been unchanged in april consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity the outlook for consumption is dimming a bit not only did hiring cool in may wage growth retreated concerns about the labor market have been uppermost in consumers minds this month a second report on friday showed consumer sentiment ebbed in early june with households worried the trade fight between washington and beijing would hurt the economy particularly the labor market president donald trump in early may imposed additional tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods prompting retaliation by beijing trump on monday threatened more duties on chinese imports if no deal was reached with chinese president xi jinping at a g20 summit later this month in japan the consumer sentiment survey from the university of michigan also appeared to suggest consumers rushed to buy big ticket household items on the tariffs list to beat anticipated price increases as a result of the duties this suggests retail sales could remain strong in june the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies prices for longer dated u s treasuries rose stocks on wall street were trading lower growth estimates raised the solid gains in core retail sales in april and may suggested consumer spending was gaining speed in the second quarter after braking sharply in the january march period that together with a third report showing a utilities led rebound in industrial production last month prompted the atlanta fed to raise its second quarter gdp growth estimate by seven tenths of a percentage point to a 2 1 annualized rate the economy grew at a 3 1 pace in the january march quarter after getting a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory exports dropped in april and inventories are expected to be a drag on growth in addition business investment softened and home sales fell in april overall the economy is losing steam as the stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending dissipates may s 0 4 rise in industrial production was the first increase this year the report from the fed also showed manufacturing production rising by a moderate 0 2 last month leaving output down this year production at factories slumped 0 5 in april manufacturing which accounts for about 12 of the economy is being constrained by an inventory overhang especially in the automotive sector that has left businesses placing fewer orders at factories motor vehicle inventories surged 0 8 in april the commerce department said in another report the trade tensions between washington and beijing are also causing bottlenecks in the supply chain those disruptions are undermining domestic industries and overseas manufacturing chinese industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed to a more than 17 year low in may the outlook hinges on product demand and the ability of businesses to whittle down undesired inventories said roiana reid an economist at berenberg capital markets in new york this hinges on global economic performance and trade volumes as well as u s activity although we expect some kind of u s china partial agreement to ease tensions on tariffs any global rebound is likely to be modest in second half of 2019 but there were some encouraging signs on the inventory bloat in the retail sales report sales at auto dealerships accelerated 0 7 after dropping 0 5 in april

u s review inflation continues to come in below expectations the producer price index import price index and the consumer price index came in slightly below expectations this week which provides the fed cover to ease if it feels it needs to retail sales bounced back in may with the headline index climbing 0 5 and the core control group category rising 0 5 motor vehicle dealer sales rose 0 7 industrial production rebounded 0 4 in may following a revised 0 4 drop the prior month the early june read on consumer sentiment fell 2 1 points to 97 9 likely reflecting concerns about possible mexican tariffs the economy has a real good poker face the fed is likely having a hard time reading the economy s strength and momentum taken at face value last friday s weaker employment report which showed a net gain of just 75 000 jobs in may and revised down the two previous months gains 75 000 jobs suggests employers have become more cautious about adding workers may s smaller than expected gain might simply be a bluff however particularly as it followed such large gains in april most other employment indicators continue to show a great deal of strength including the latest jolts data and the weekly initial unemployment claims which rose this past week but remain near historic lows the jolts survey noted that hires rose slightly to 5 9 million in april while separations were essentially unchanged at 5 6 million there were 7 5 million job openings against just 5 8 million unemployed marking the 14th month in a row job openings exceeded the number of unemployed the latest nfib survey showed the share of small businesses that tried to hire workers the past three months rose five points to 62 in may of those hiring 54 reported few or no qualified applicants this past month s inflation data also suggest the fed is holding some pretty good cards all three of the price indices released this week showed prices rising slightly less than consensus estimates once again extenuating circumstances could prove that the lower inflation data are nothing more than a feint the headline producer price index ppi rose just 0 1 in may while prices excluding food and energy products rose 0 2 year over year changes in both series moderated slightly with the headline index sliding 0 4 percentage points to 1 8 and core ppi inflation falling 0 1 percentage point to 2 3 while good news the ppi has not provided all that much insight into inflationary trends the cpi came in better than expected with both the headline and core price measures rising just 0 1 falling gasoline prices helped hold down the headline measure while another large drop in used car prices helped contain the core cpi residential rent also moderated following some larger increases in prior months excluding the drop in used car prices which should prove transitory the core cpi would be close to 2 year over year as for the impact of tariffs it is hard to see in the import data import prices fell 0 3 in may on an overall basis and excluding petroleum products on a year over year basis import prices are down 1 5 while tariffs are not directly reflected in import prices the continued slide adds credence to reports that chinese suppliers have been absorbing much of the tariff so far retaliatory tariffs and slower global economic growth might also explain the larger drop in export prices which are now down 0 7 year over year regardless of what cards remain to be dealt the fed is holding a pretty strong hand the preponderance of employment data suggest the fed is meeting its mandate of achieving maximum employment while inflation is running below expectations the fed has room to ease pre emptively to head off a more substantial pullback in domestic demand and untoward deceleration in inflation u s outlook housing starts tuesday more favorable buying conditions and relatively lower building costs have led to strengthening new residential construction in recent months total housing starts jumped 5 7 during april boosted by a sturdy 6 2 rise in single family and a 4 7 increase in multifamily starts that said homebuilding continues to be sluggish so far this year total starts are running 7 2 below last year s level on a yearto date basis building permits rose a more modest 0 6 last month the recent trend of number of permits issued running well ahead of actual starts is a sign that residential activity will remain fairly subdued in coming months residential building appears to have topped out in early 2018 which means year over year comparisons will get easier moving forward looking ahead we expect residential construction to gradually march higher but a surge in activity is unlikely previous 1 23m wells fargo 1 237m consensus 1 240m fomc rate decision wednesday we expect fed officials will vote to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged at the june 18 19 fomc meeting that noted we do anticipate some forthcoming adjustments to monetary policy in the months ahead we look for the fed to trim rates 25 bps in q3 and another 25 bps in q4 likely at the july and october meetings our view that the fomc will move rates down 50 bps in total later this year comes amid tepid inflation and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy which appears to be indirectly slowing business investment and economic growth more broadly furthermore with few inflationary pressures and only 225 bps of potential rate cuts as ammunition the fomc may deem it prudent to have an insurance cut to head off slower economic growth at the pass we have also downgraded our real gdp forecast from 2 8 to 2 6 for 2019 previous 2 50 wells fargo 2 50 consensus 2 50 existing home sales friday improved buying conditions have helped to ameliorate the sharp pullback in resales but clearly not reversed it during april sales fell 0 4 to a 5 19 million unit pace with the exception of february existing home sales have declined on a monthly basis every month so far this year the continuing mismatch between strengthening entry level demand and scarce entry level supply is playing an outsized role in the lethargic pace of sales this year still even at an underwhelming pace sales should remain fairly solid home price appreciation continues to ease which should help address the affordability issues currently plaguing the housing market mortgage rates also continue to track lower which has led to an upturn in mortgage applications more favorable buying conditions should support existing home sales and we expect modest gains in coming months previous 5 19m wells fargo 5 33m consensus 5 30m global review global growth steady start softer finish this week saw confirmation that the global economy began 2019 on better footing gdp for the g20 economies rose 0 8 quarter over quarter and held steady at 3 3 year over year there are questions however as to whether solid growth can be sustained both for the u s and internationally u k april data were especially soft with large drops in both gdp and manufacturing output eurozone industrial output also fell in april while china s may economic data were mixed given signs of slowing activity we forecast noticeably lower global gdp growth for 2019 of 3 2 down from 3 6 growth seen in 2018 hopes for a chinese upturn diminishing this week s data offered the latest reading on the health of the chinese economy after some encouraging signs during the first quarter of 2019 growth appears to have softened a touch in q2 may retail sales firmed to 8 6 year over over a rebound from the sharply slower growth reported for april however may industrial output slowed to 5 0 year over year the smallest gain since 2002 while fixed asset investment for the january may period also slowed to 5 6 year over year the diffident nature of chinese data is of some concern especially considering the more recent escalation in trade tensions between china and the united states for may the 7 7 year over year gain in exports in local currency terms looks to us more like temporary relief than a sustained improvement while chinese authorities will no doubt continue to use monetary and fiscal policy tools to cushion the growth slowdown our 2019 gdp growth of 6 1 would be well below the 6 6 gain registered in 2018 u k suffering growth hangover in q2 after a solid start to the year the u k economy has lost momentum heading into q2 for april gdp contracted 0 4 month over month after a 0 1 fall in march services output was flat in april but it was the manufacturing sector in particular where the weakness was concentrated april industrial output declined 2 7 month over month including a sharp 3 9 fall in manufacturing output reports suggested u k companies had built up inventories significantly ahead of the expected march brexit deadline and the sharp drop in april output is very much in line with that view separately the u k labor market was not particularly strong but not especially soft either average weekly earnings slowed to 3 1 year over year in the three months through april while job growth also slowed albeit by less than expected with employment up 32 000 for february april compared to the november january period altogether this week s data suggest a slowdown in u k q2 gdp which we currently forecast to contract 0 1 quarter over quarter the latest from latin america in mexico april industrial output rose 1 5 month over month although that largely reversed a large march decline compared to april 2018 industrial output fell 2 9 including a 0 4 fall in manufacturing output the latter was the first fall in manufacturing output since march 2018 although base effects partly contributed to the fall the figures suggest the suspension of u s tariffs on mexico was something of a relief with mexico s industrial sector somewhat tentative even ahead of those proposed tariffs in brazil april economic figures were subdued albeit less so than march april retail sales returned to modestly positive territory with a 1 7 year over year gain but with industrial output falling april economic activity fell 0 6 year over year brazil s recovery remains gradual and unsteady and we view it as too soon to confirm that a sustained upswing is underway global outlook bank of england decision thursday the bank of england makes its latest monetary policy announcement next week and is widely expected to hold its bank rate steady at 0 75 u k inflation has been relatively contained the may cpi is also released next week and the core cpi is forecast to ease to 1 7 year over year slightly below the midpoint of the central bank s inflation target may retail sales are also due and are expected to fall 0 4 month over month combined with the reported drop in april gdp the mix of slower economic growth benign inflation and still unresolved brexit uncertainties are likely to keep bank of england policy on hold for an extended period in fact given the persistent brexit uncertainty and slowing u k growth we have further pushed back our forecast timing for bank of england rate hikes we see no move this year while in 2020 we expect the central bank to raise rates twice in q2 and q4 previous 0 75 wells fargo 0 75 consensus 0 75 eurozone pmis friday after eurozone q1 gdp grew a respectable 0 4 quarter overquarter a noticeable pickup from the pace during the second half of last year concerns have persisted about the steadiness and sustainability of the economic expansion april industrial output fell 0 5 month over month a second straight decline while in may the services pmi essentially held steady and the manufacturing pmi eased with eurozone core cpi inflation running at just 0 8 year over year the european central bank has adjusted its forward guidance in a dovish direction now signaling that interest rates will remain at their present level until at least mid 2020 the eurozone pmis are closely monitored as a timely indicator on the health of the eurozone economy for june the services pmi is expected to edge up to 53 0 the manufacturing pmi is also expected to rise to 47 9 though remaining in contraction territory for the fifth month in a row previous 47 7 manufacturing 52 9 services consensus 47 9 manufacturing 53 0 services canada retail sales friday canadian economic growth was especially soft to start the year with gdp growing at an annualized 0 4 pace over the past two quarters however q1 gdp included some encouraging details most notably solid consumer and investment spending and final domestic demand monthly gdp also finished the first quarter on a solid note with march gdp rising 0 5 month over month we view this soft growth patch as somewhat transitory and see quarterly growth improving as 2019 progresses with canada s core cpi close to target that pickup in growth is an important element of our bank of canada rate view should canada s economy show more solid trends that should be enough for the central bank to keep rates steady both this year and next in this context next week s april retail sales data should attract attention the consensus forecast is for a 0 3 month over month sales gain which would come after large february and march increases previous 1 1 month over month consensus 0 3 month over month point of view interest rate watch fifty bps of easing in our forecast we recently changed our outlook for fed policy to include two rate cuts in 2019 see our monthly economic outlook for details specifically we now think it is likely that the federal open market committee fomc will cut rates by 25 bps at its july 31 meeting and by another 25 bps in q4 probably at the october 30 meeting top chart we base our revised fed outlook largely on two considerations first the fed has not had much success achieving its 2 inflation target recently indeed the rate of pce inflation the fomc s preferred measure of consumer price inflation has generally fallen short of 2 in the last five to six years middle chart in an effort to show that its inflation target is symmetric and to raise inflation expectations the fomc may be willing to tolerate an inflation rate that exceeds 2 for a while more accommodative monetary policy would help to achieve that objective second the fomc has only 225 bps of conventional ammunition at this time therefore it may be prudent to undertake an insurance rate cut or two in coming months to head off any economic trouble before it materializes as we noted in our monthly report and its companion piece our base case view of 50 bps of rate cuts depends crucially on the assumption we have made regarding trade policy however if the u s and china agree to a trade deal and uncertainty dissipates then the economic outlook would improve and the case for fed easing at this time would be less compelling on the other hand a full blown trade war between the world s two largest economies likely would lead to more than 50 bps of fed easing pricing in the bond market suggests that market participants expect the fomc will slash rates 75 bps by early next year therefore we have less easing in our forecast than currently priced into markets consequently we forecast that yields on longer dated treasury securities will rise modestly in coming months for example we look for the yield on the 10 year treasury note which has receded from 2 60 in mid april to around 2 10 at present bottom chart will drift up to 2 30 by year end stay tuned credit market insights falling consumer inflation expectations support case for rate cuts consumer inflation expectations continue to fall reaching the lowest level since late 2017 in may according to the new york fed s survey of consumer expectations other responses point to the broad based strength in the labor market with 2 5 earnings growth expected over the next year as the unemployment rate holds at a 50 year low of 3 6 the reported probability of being able to find a new job if one s current job were lost rose to a record high since the question was first asked in 2013 yet the survey responses regarding expectations of future prices add to the growing concerns over the downward drift in inflationary pressure indeed market implied average inflation rates over the next five years have fallen around 20 bps since the end of april while realized inflation has persistently undershot the fed s 2 target and by an increasing margin of late as noted in the column to the left we see the fed s desire to boost inflation and inflation expectations as a major justification to ease notwithstanding any trade related uncertainty in powell s last public comments before the june fomc meeting blackout period he stated the fed must take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a robust economy could precipitate a difficult toarrest downward drift in inflation expectations the latest survey data point to this being the case and support our view that the fed will cut rates 25 bps in july topic of the week will insurance cuts solve inflation s shortfall as we discussed in our interest rate watch on the previous page we now expect the fomc to cut the fed funds rate by 50 bps in the second half of this year partly for insurance reasons but also in an effort to shore up inflation core pce inflation briefly brushed the fomc s 2 target a few months last year but has subsequently fallen back to 1 6 the average of the current cycle more accommodative policy would help support growth and hiring putting pressure on remaining resource capacity in the economy and leading firms to raise prices that would help drive inflation in cyclically sensitive categories higher all else equal and help to chip away at core inflation s current shortfall slack is not the only driver of inflation however and is a relatively small one at that inflation expectations bear significantly greater explanatory power in models of inflation while secular trends in technology globalization and public policy are also influential at issue for the fomc is that slack is the part of the inflation equation that the committee can influence in the short term prices in acyclical inflation categories have been running lower than cyclical areas in recent years and are materially weaker compared to historic trends top chart relative to each category s average since 1990 how far back you need to go for total core inflation to average 2 0 cyclical inflation is just a tick below its historic average bottom chart most of the shortfall from the fed s 2 target can be traced to acyclical categories which is more than a full percentage point below its long run trend on net we would expect fed easing in the coming months to support higher inflation by driving the cyclicallysensitive areas of inflation higher yet with acyclical categories responsible for the bulk of the undershoot rate cuts are unlikely to solve inflation s persistent shortfall on their own we look for core inflation to continue to run below 2 through the second half of the year even as the fed likely provides some additional policy support please see our special report

senator elizabeth warren presents herself as the antithesis of president donald trump yet they share a populist economic vision as they seek to channel the grievances of working class americans who have been left behind by globalization the democrat and the republican have called for wielding the power of the state to protect american industries from foreign competition with actions like tariffs against trading partners and interventions to curb the value of the dollar trump rode his rhetoric to the white house in 2016 warren a massachusetts senator who has been an advocate for protectionist measures in congress is betting that a similar message will help her capture her party s nomination and win back the industrial midwestern states that handed trump the presidency although their policy prescriptions in many areas are polar opposites their shared populist views allow them to stand apart from the democratic front runner former vice president joe biden who is associated with the free trade policies of the obama administration diagnosis of decline warren labels her approach economic patriotism and trump uses the slogan america first they share a belief that failed policies not just the inexorable march of automation and globalization are responsible for the decline of u s manufacturing and the loss of blue collar jobs a trend they believe is reversible most recently they have both criticized what they consider to be an overvalued dollar against other major currencies which they say hurts the u s in global markets last week warren called for actively managing the dollar s strength to bolster american exports this week trump bemoaned the very strong dollar relative to other currencies saying that it puts the u s at a big disadvantage a forced devaluation of the dollar would break with a longstanding bipartisan consensus among american presidents about the virtues of free trade yet after decades of flat wages that haven t kept up with health care costs or college tuition the appetite to act to protect domestic workers and companies has grown in both parties the idea of such protectionist measures is anathema to prominent economists of past administrations such as larry summers who served as treasury secretary under president bill clinton and was a top economic adviser to president barack obama no country can devalue its way to prosperity summers said in an interview i am hopeful that these ideas will be rejected populists on the left and right have tended to oppose trade agreements he said the rhetoric of class warfare is divisive and unlikely to bring economic benefit warren and the president she s seeking to challenge both support using tariffs to reorient trade policy though she has criticized trump s dart throwing approach on mexico the two have called out u s multinational companies for moving jobs overseas where labor is cheaper last november trump said he was very disappointed with general motors for announcing that it would close plants in maryland michigan and ohio in her plan for economic patriotism released last week warren assailed giant american corporations who control our economy yet have no loyalty or allegiance to america she cited general electric co s decision to shut down a factory in wisconsin last year trump and warren have both condemned past trade accords including the north american free trade agreement and the trans pacific partnership they re united in a belief that u s policies are responsible for the decline of the once vibrant manufacturing sector and both have called for ending wars and other foreign interventions to refocus resources on the u s this rhetoric resonates with many americans in both parties said former congressman brad miller a north carolina democrat who is economically liberal and culturally moderate what s being called economic populism is wildly popular miller said the overwhelming majority of americans including those who voted for trump are for stronger economic reform for protections of people on the short end of the power imbalance when they deal with business warren has risen in the democratic race as voters take note of her policy focus an economist yougov survey released wednesday found her in second place with 16 overtaking another populist senator bernie sanders of vermont and behind biden who had 27 in an illustration of the left right populist convergence warren s economic platform earned striking praise from conservative fox news anchor tucker carlson who has built an audience by picking fights with the left on cultural issues like immigration many of warren s policy prescriptions make obvious sense carlson said on his program last week hailing her plan to require the government to buy american products and to bolster workplace apprenticeships she sounds like donald trump at his best still there are major differences warren wants to tax wealthy americans and strengthen rules on businesses while trump has cut taxes on top earners and boasted about slashing corporate regulations warren calls for expanding the safety net trump decries such moves as socialism and wants to shrink government aid warren has also distanced herself from trump s updated nafta agreement saying it doesn t do enough to protect workers or the environment president trump showered tax giveaways on giant multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas and negotiated a weak nafta 2 0 that won t stop outsourcing or create jobs said chris hayden a warren spokesman unlike this president who caters to the wealthy and the well connected elizabeth will actually stand with american workers and aggressively use all the tools of government to defend and create good american jobs trump campaign spokeswoman erin perrine said president trump s policies and goals have always been clear hire american buy american no one has fought harder for the american worker than president trump the appeal of economic populism in the democratic party was evident in sanders unexpectedly strong challenge in 2016 to eventual nominee hillary clinton running again in 2020 sanders is touching on the same themes of rejecting trade deals and cracking down on corporations that move jobs overseas sanders campaign manager faiz shakir said trump won in 2016 by running as fake bernie sanders in the gop economic populism had long been confined to the fringes trump s 2016 victory and overwhelming support among his party s voters has elevated those sentiments into the mainstream disappointing pro trade conservatives populism is rooted in opportunist politics and because of that makes little sense as coherent economic policy most republicans are still not populists but it s sure on the rise said brendan buck who served as counselor to former u s

efforts are needed to avoid a worldwide competitive devaluation of currencies triggered by trade frictions said zhou xiaochuan former governor of the people s bank of china speaking at the two day lujiazui forum which attracted government business and academic leaders from home and abroad and ended on friday in shanghai zhou said the nonprofit financial stability board which monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system should help avoid such a devaluation thereby giving a more positive signal to the global financial market the issue is timely given the approach of the g20 osaka summit on june 28 and 29 he said zhou said trade problems will again trigger competitive devaluations as in the last global financial crisis he said fiscal and central bank regulators of different countries reached an earlier consensus to make joint efforts to avoid competitive devaluation there is no winner if a trade war is waged the world s exchange rates will confront fluctuations and the entire financial order will be chaotic if every country adopts competitive devaluation he said competitive devaluation is a series of sudden currency depreciations between two national currencies as a result of tit for tat moves to gain an edge in international export markets in 2016 the international monetary fund asked its member countries to refrain from all forms of protectionism and competitive devaluations zhou further warned that every country s gdp will contract though at different levels if there is a trade war in that case economic regulators will adopt more active or expansionary fiscal and currency policies to address the side effects of an economic slowdown he said but trade losses cannot be directly offset by adjusting macroeconomic policies creating a global predicament he said in the short term countries should turn to fundamentally addressing trade tensions such as putting the world trade order back on track via trade talks and world trade organization reform he said for china there should be more favorable export policies to find new markets and build new outlets to make up for the affected exports to the united states china s exports are of good quality and reasonable prices we have seen from the experience of the last financial crisis that chinese exporters have enough flexibility and resilience with policy incentives chinese exporters will find new markets within two or three years time he said paul romer co recipient of the 2018 nobel memorial prize in economic sciences said that there might be some short term volatility from trade tensions but china has always coped with large fluctuations well and is sure to do the same vice premier liu he said at forum s opening on thursday that china s long term positive economic growth will not be altered and there is still a huge amount of room for development in its macroeconomy china has confidence to face any challenges he said

caught between muted inflation and the prospect of a trade war the federal reserve has a fine line to walk at its meeting next week wall street is growing more certain that the central bank will implement one if not more interest rate cuts this year the consumer price index ticked up just 0 1 percent in may following a 0 3 percent increase the previous month in addition to wednesday s inflation measures the department of labor said thursday that import prices for may fell by 0 3 percent a steeper drop than expected this weaker than expected inflation data gives the fed a more compelling case for a rate cut adding to the growing amount of data that indicates a softening economy this adds to the narrative that the fed is likely to begin cutting rates later this year against the backdrop of slowing economic growth said emily roland head of capital markets research at john hancock investment management the reason the cpi data matters is it reinforces in the fed s mind what s been a troubling trend of slowing inflation that s less than their target said joseph lavorgna managing director and chief economist of the americas at natixis if the fed does pivot toward a more dovish stance as many expect more accommodative monetary policy will be driven by a combination of economic metrics signaling slower growth and worry about the destabilizing effect of a potential trade war with china the median dot plot from the march meeting showed one rate hike for next year but the bond market is now pricing in three rate cuts roland said for an institution that prizes stability and balance this turnaround has come at a surprising pace it s been a remarkable shift in the posture of the fed in just the past few weeks said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america the numbers came in a little bit lighter than expected which means the fed does have some more room to consider a cut said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network but that move would be unlikely to come right away the fed has always said they are data dependent and the current data suggests they shouldn t do anything mcmillan said my guess is they ll hold off a little bit longer to get some clarity on maybe how the next payroll numbers are showing up gdp revisions maybe some progress on g 20 with trade lavorgna said the fed has a lot of reasons to cut rates it s not just the trade issues among economists though there is a growing expectation that the language used by fed chairman jerome powell will indicate that the prospect of a rate cut in july is on the table wall street always parses the minutiae of fed remarks but reading tea leaves this time around is a particularly high stakes activity at this point the fed is in a sit tight posture they re waiting to see what happens i m going to be looking for any sign that they re shifting from watchful waiting to we have to act mcmillan said they re very aware of what could go wrong the biggest unknown is the outcome of a potential china trade deal if the white house and beijing fail to meet at the g 20 summit later this month and forge a deal that will avert tariffs being levied on the entirety of chinese goods entering the u s the case for faster monetary easing grows stronger it all boils down to whether the fed is really concerned about the economic danger of the trade war mcmillan said the fed s other challenge is one of optics economists say president donald trump has frequently criticized his appointee to lead the central bank and called for lower interest rates the appearance that the central bank is acting on trump s bidding would hurt the fed s reputation and would be likely to spook investors if they continue to ease and it looks like they re doing it at the president s direction that does considerable damage to market confidence mcmillan said i actually do think that s part of the decision north said but we re also looking at weak data he said if indications of a slowdown continue to accumulate in prices consumption and job growth metrics it increases the likelihood that trump will eventually get his rate cut especially if the trade standoff is not resolved it appears that there is pressure to have a powell put on the economy north said but the fundamentals justify it as well it s not just what trump is saying

reigniting the sputtering sector after a significant slowdown in 2018 real estate economic data mortgage demand surges on lower mortgage rates the resurgence of housing related stocks in 2019 has been largely driven by the pullback in the 30 year mortgage rate which had climbed through 2018 and reached six year highs around 5 0 in november at their peak last year rates were higher by roughly 150 basis points on a year over year basis the most significant climb in mortgage rates in decades since then rates have pulled back by roughly 120 basis points and there are indications that buyers may be coming back from the sidelines weekly applications for mortgage loans jumped by 26 last week led by a 47 jump in refinancing mortgages the mba purchase index a useful leading indicator of new and existing home sales continues to show strong growth up by 10 over the past six months as we discussed in our recent report homebuilders it s a buyers market homebuyers appear to be sensing a short window of opportunity where home price appreciation has moderated while affordability has greatly improved given the sharp decline in mortgage rates for homebuilders the winds have shifted rather dramatically over the last five months as the strongest headwinds of 2018 higher materials prices and higher mortgage rates have turned into tailwinds this year we expect these forward looking metrics to begin to show up in the slower reacting home sales and construction data within the next month or two perhaps as soon as next week s housing starts permits data inflation remains tame but rents growth heats up inflation was and remains the key threat to potentially ending the nearly decade long economic recovery rising oil prices along with rising costs from tariffs and trade disputes had put upward pressure on inflation throughout 2018 pushing both the 10 year yield and 30 year mortgage rates to post recession highs the plunge in oil prices in late 2018 along with moderating global growth has quelled much or all of that inflationary pressure all three inflation indexes core cpi ppi and pce were cooler than expected in may and have continued to trend down in recent months moderating inflation should give the fed more confidence that an interest rate cut has limited risk of resulting in near term overheating housing cpi shelter accounts for more than a third of the total cpi weight 42 including housing related services and since 2013 housing inflation has been significantly above the overall inflation rate from 2015 through late 2016 housing inflation was one of the only components keeping core cpi out of deflationary territory and since 2013 core inflation excluding housing has averaged less than 1 housing inflation has reaccelerated over the last several months after moderating slightly in 2018 consistent with recent private market rent growth data showing a reacceleration in rents since late 2018 at 3 7 primary rents ticked back slightly after reaching are rising at the fastest rate since mid 2017 last month the importance of housing costs on the overall price index cannot be overstated since 1995 shelter inflation has outpaced the broader rate of inflation by more than 1 per year fueled by a persistent supply shortage in the most in demand us housing markets over the last three decades structural impediments to supply growth aggravated by the dramatic dislocations during the housing crisis have dramatically slowed the rate of housing starts per capita on a rolling 10 year average residential fixed investment as a share of gdp is the lowest since the end of ww2 the implications of this housing shortage we believe will be a continued persistence of real housing cost inflation and a long runway for growth in residential housing construction in order to equalize the supply demand imbalance as we discussed last week amid this housing shortage demand for housing has accelerated over the past three years driven by robust job growth and rising real wage growth 2018 was the strongest year for household formations both renting and owning since 1985 at nearly 2 below trend household formation growth in the post recession

tariffs and excess inventory labor costs have risen considerably over the last two years as eighteen states raised their minimum wage in 2018 and many cities largely in already high cost markets have raised minimum wages over the last two years oftentimes far above market rate which has begun to result in retail job cuts and store closures hourly earnings surged to 5 in early 2019 outpacing the

democratic presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren released a new plan on friday to level the playing field for entrepreneurs of color by providing business grants to minorities in order to close the startup capital gap the difference in capital available to white entrepreneurs versus entrepreneurs of color warren argues that every american should have a fair shot at starting a small business but says the playing field is currently drastically uneven with entrepreneurs of color starting businesses with far less money than their white counterparts she writes that disparity severely affects minority owned businesses ability to attract investors and apply for credit as well as their bottom lines disparity in startup capital is the single biggest reason that promising black owned businesses on average are less profitable and bring on fewer employees than white owned businesses she said in order to level the playing field for entrepreneurs warren has a plan to distribute 7 billion to minority businesspeople every american should have a fair shot at starting a small business but today the playing field is tilted against black and brown entrepreneurs my new plan would put an end to that elizabeth warren ewarren june 15 2019 how the plan will work warren proposes distributing 7 billion in grants through a new small business equity fund she stresses that the money will be in the form of grants not loans or loan guarantees in order to ensure entrepreneurs can focus on growing their businesses rather than on repaying debt the fund would be managed by warren s comprehensive new department of economic development which vox s matthew yglesias explained in a piece on warren s economic patriotism one specific bullet point on warren s policy agenda is to create a unified department of economic development that would combine the functions of the commerce department with the small business administration the patent and trademark office various job training and r d programs scattered around the bureaucracy and the export and trade agencies including the office of the us trade representative the bureaucratic reorganization however is basically just to set the stage for a mission statement the new department will have a single goal creating and defending good american jobs although the small business equity fund would be overseen at the federal level warren sees state and local stakeholders as being key to distributing funds she says her program will be modeled on the state small business credit initiative a federal program that gave states a great degree of say in how they chose to distribute 1 5 billion this freedom was given as officials felt local leaders have a better grasp of the needs of entrepreneurs in their states than federal officials would under warren s plan local governments would be required to work with minority investment managers to decide how the funds would be spent the federal government would also create guidelines for who would be eligible for the grants they would be limited to entrepreneurs who are eligible for the small business administration s existing 8 a program to be eligible for that program a business must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual who has less than 100 000 in household wealth this figure encompasses a large percentage of minority families according to the federal reserve the median net worth of a black family is 17 600 while the median net worth of a latinx family is 20 700 warren would also work at the federal level to increase the minority business development agency s budget she pledges to triple its funding in her presidential budget as with many of warren s other plans the cost of this proposal would be entirely covered by her proposed wealth tax a 2 percent tax on every dollar of wealth an american owns above 50 million and a 3 percent tax on every dollar of wealth above 1 billion according to the candidate the 7 billion investment would help create 100 000 new minority owned businesses and as a result provide 1 1 million jobs the startup capital gap and why it matters warren s proposal states that the startup capital gap is the single biggest reason minority owned businesses are less profitable on average than white owned businesses and that capital gap is vast the typical black entrepreneur the candidate notes starts a business with one third the startup capital of the typical white entrepreneur part of this is due to difficulties receiving loans another part of it is that minority families often have less wealth to invest in a family member s startup than white families do as a stanford business school report found latino business owners tend to depend on personal savings and seed funding from friends and family to start their businesses and are much more likely to use personal guarantees than business assets to secure financing having less money at the beginning of a business makes it more difficult to attract money later on as it limits the amount an entrepreneur can invest in things like prototyping real estate inventory and marketing all things that when done successfully attract new investors and credit while the wealth threshold to quality for warren s program may seem relatively low 100 000 is far more than most minority families have on hand according to the senator who cites research that found 100 000 is roughly five times the median net worth of latinx and black families and more than 10 times the median net worth of native american families warren s plan invokes the language of reparations something she has vocally endorsed on the campaign trail particularly when it suggests that the government has an obligation to address the racial wealth gap because the government helped create that wealth gap with decades of sanctioned discrimination it is important to note however that this policy is for all minorities rather than just for black americans how warren s plan compares to other candidates plans warren released her plan ahead of the black economic alliance s presidential forum in south carolina which she will be attending alongside a number of other democratic presidential candidates including cory booker beto o rourke and pete buttigieg o rourke released his own small business plan on saturday focusing on women communities of color and small businesses more generally his plan hopes to create 200 000 new small businesses to warren s 100 000 and pledges a 10 billion small business credit initiative for economically distressed areas to warren s 7 billion small business equity fund notably o rourke s plan doesn t give funding directly to small business owners in the form of grants instead it funds a range of programs designed to increase loan accessibility and reduce discrimination like warren he has pledged to triple investment in the minority business development agency in order to provide resources and mentorship to minority small business owners booker is attending several south carolina events around this weekend s forum and is expected to use his stops to discuss the racial wealth gap and growing small businesses owned by african americans although he has not released a specific policy proposal others democrats have proposed more small business friendly policies both o rourke and tulsi gabbard have suggested cutting or offering deductions on small business taxes but proposals such as these fail to account for the wealth gap that prevents entrepreneurs of color from opening a business in the first place this plan fits in well with warren s myriad other plans warren has the most plans of any 2020 candidate but almost all of her plans have the same overarching purpose erasing the wealth gap her overall platform is focused on what she calls economic patriotism and this new plan fits right into that larger vision as vox s ezra klein explained warren s tagline is i have a plan for that and on one level it s true she has a lot of plans but a clearer way of understanding her pitch is she s got one plan that she applies over and over again as warren sees it there s been a massive hoarding of wealth and thus of power and opportunity in this country she wants to tax the wealth and redistribute both the money and the opportunity she wants to break up concentrations of economic power by putting workers on corporate boards and unleashing antitrust regulators on amazon and facebook and ending washington s revolving door these are different policies yes but they all say the same thing the wealthy have too much money and power and warren wants to change that her newest proposal is grounded in these same themes it disparages an uneven playing field and she argues that it will move us closer to an america where everyone has a fair shot to succeed economic issues remain a top concern for democratic voters and by adding her entrepreneurial investment plan to her portfolio of economic patriotism initiatives warren continues to suggest that addressing that concern is one of her top priorities
the international monetary fund imf and the world bank cannot help liberia only good leadership sound policies and a change of attitude from all liberians will make liberia a better place to live work and do business by jones nhinson williams like the world bank the imf is a respected global institution because of its founding and current membership sponsors and physical location while the imf oversees the stability of the world s monetary system the world bank s goal is to reduce poverty by offering support to middle income and low income countries both institutions are based in washington d c the center of global power and were instituted as part of the bretton woods agreement in 1945 right after the second world war which lasted from 1939 1945 however these facts in no way suggest that the imf and the world bank are flawless or accurate in most of their activities estimations projections utterances publications and impacts for example the imf recently announced that liberia should expect a worsening economic condition in the next year or two if nothing is done fast to address the gaps this prediction or projection is not data driven liberia and a number of african countries have no legitimate economic data or a process thereof data collected and used in liberia by most if not all international organizations has a hundred percent absolute margin of error since they are not grounded in any scientific survey of any sort so what drives the imf s recent conclusions about the liberian economy perhaps perceptions of political and social events in liberia but again the imf cannot and should not make an economic forecast based on mere political and social events so why are liberians jumping up and down because the imf has made an unsubstantiated and unscientific pronouncement about the country s economy based on a no data driven analysis some of the purposeful criticisms of the imf include the fact that in granting a loan to poor countries the institution makes the loan conditional on the implementation of certain economic policies these policies tend to involve reducing government borrowing higher taxes and lower spending in fact the world bank and the imf would not admit that their policies can be an additional headache in some instances which is also another serious problem furthermore the imf has repeatedly refused to change its priorities and let go of its outdated conditions of privatization deregulation of markets and austerity in social services which many experts believe in the past have provoked human rights violations and instead make loans subject to a new set of conditions over and again history and practical experience show that the imf has not only undermined but also ruined and or exacerbated the problems of the most struggling economies especially those of african countries through their ready made policy prescriptions its model as well as the model of the world bank were mainly set up during the end of the second world war to rebuild the economies of europe meaning these institutions initial and underlying principles and policy alignments were not intended for africa even though globalization necessitate that they deal with the african continent they now do so not because they want to but because they have to considering that africa plays an invaluable role in the global economy yet both institutions remain defiant against adjusting their strategies guidelines and overall philosophy it is because of this and other reasons that the imf has often punished the poor in poorly performing and economically volatile african nations whenever it imposes its ready made sanctions under the guise of monetary and fiscal policies consequently the belief that the intervention of the imf the world bank and whatever international organization will change liberia for the better is a fallacy and a waste of time of course these global institutions can and will help any country in need of life support because of bad governance and poor economic management the best they can do is to provide provisional relief and perhaps minimum development support so the news and gratification that when the imf policies and programs are implemented in liberia it means manna will fall from heaven is amusing at best this will not happen things will get worse and liberia will stay unchanged if liberians continue to remain in their set ways as well as display their self destructive self pity and lack of patriotism attitude the bad situation in liberia is a liberian problem and can better be solved and addressed adequately by seasoned experienced and credible liberians who understand their own problems the only condition is those seasoned experienced and credible liberians should not only be willing patriotic dedicated and committed to doing so they must also be supported by the liberian people including the power that be liberia s current problems can easily be solved when liberians collectively agree to establish new innovative and strategic entities as well as strengthen the country s existing legal democratic economic social and political institutions such that there is an absolute application of the rule of law accountability transparency and a merit based competition system although many people believe the imf s ready made prescription will be the salvation for liberia s current meltdown it might end up hurting the already poor segment of the liberian population it is time president weah and the cdc led administration realize that nothing the imf and the world bank can do differently when everything as is in liberia remains the same if the president is really serious and wants a real solid presidential and leadership legacy and a better country he must act act fast and now instead of banking on the imf and the world bank the liberian government needs to create private sector jobs support innovation and be transparent and accountable in its activities every government agency and heads of agencies must have bi weekly monthly and quarterly deliverables that aim at making liberia a better place to live work and do business liberians need concrete deliverables from the agricultural sector tourism and hospitality sector communications and the information technology sector healthcare sector educational sector infrastructural and housing sector trade and commerce sector services sector workforce development and innovation sector professional services sector and of course from the overall public policy domain and the legislative sphere job creation and entrepreneurship are important in solving liberia s socio economic problems because the stability of any economy rests on the ability to maintain a low unemployment rate and provide a safe secure workplace liberians need to be put to work one of the most important aspects of work is that it provides a person with the income necessary to meet basic living needs and according to several types of research having work also gives people a sense of identity and a feeling of accomplishing activities that contribute to society acclaimed economists policymakers social scientists and others have all acknowledged that jobs are important for several reasons jobs provide workers with the personal feelings of self worth and satisfaction and produce revenue for families communities and the government which in turn encourages spending and stimulates the larger economy besides having a job is animportant part of people s lives it means more than just getting paid it means being able to make your own choices about how you want to live your life to create jobs and improve liberia s workforce and the labor market would require having sound policies innovative advisement and efficient managers without these a mere reliance on the intervention of the imf and the world bank would not solve liberia s deep seated and troubling socio economic dangers because job creation is so important almost every u s president a lawmaker and state governor makes that a non partisan pre occupation and priority for example president bill clinton created 18 6 million jobs during his two terms in office that was the most number of jobs of any u s president the greatest jobs producer president by percent was president franklin d roosevelt even though roosevelt only added 9 6 million new positions it was a 21 5 percent increase in the total jobs created that said let us analyze the importance of employment in details 1 employment is important for economic development and social stability 2 social development is the result of employment 3 employment reduces the level of corruption and crime in a system and in society 4 employment is a vital unit of poverty alleviation 5 employment empowers women and girls and prevents or reduces prostitution and abuse 6 employment gives people and communities a voice and enables them to become full participants of their governance and democratic process 7 employment leads to a secure retirement and 8 only employment can stop people from becoming such a thing as a protester rogue armed robber or even terrorist it is also not just important that jobs are created but that the jobs created are sustainable for the foreseeable future this is why creating duplicate and unnecessary jobs or positions in any government is counter productive to economic viability as we can see the heavy burden on the current liberian government is largely imposed by the government s unnecessary wage bill for the weah administration to succeed and if the cdc government means business the president and the administration need to put partisanship and unhelpful politics aside and focus on delivering for the liberian people by supporting private sector entrepreneurship among liberians in all fields and industry sectors this would require facilitating an open transparent enabling and friendly business climate as well as removing all roadblocks to new ideas and entrepreneurship entrepreneurship is vital to the small business establishment because small businesses are often called the backbone of any economy policies that therefore encourage the growth of small businesses and facilitate the role of entrepreneurship and innovation in the labor and investment market are considered to be healthy for the economy at large moreover entrepreneurs create new businesses in the form of new goods and services this in turn can produce a cascading effect by stimulating related businesses or sectors supporting the new venture furthering economic development for example a few innovations and it companies established the indian it industry in the 1990s while serving as a programmers hub thereafter the it industry in india gathered pace in its own programmers domain but more importantly millions from other sectors benefited from it for more see top indian billionaires and how they made their money finally no amount of imf s doctrine and the world bank s fat check can save liberia from its economic and social vulnerabilities or those of any country in africa president weah and the cdc led administration irrespective of political affiliation friendship personal loyalty etc must seek the help of other liberians who have the required capabilities experience creativity and competence president paul kagame has and continues to do this in rwanda without the imf and the world bank and see where his country is president weah and the cdc led administration should follow the footsteps of president paul kagame and the rwandan government
in the years immediately preceding world war ii winston churchill is quoted as having said the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences world war ii purported to be the war to end all wars ended in 1945 after the usa dropped two nuclear bombs on japan it didn t end wars but it did have huge consequences evidence of which is unfolding even today perhaps the greatest single consequence is a combination of the growth of money and banking systems the rampant exploitation of natural resources and the parallel growth of production consumption pollution of all sorts this is turn has spawned environmental and ecological consequences on a planetary scale with accompanying existential threats finance debt economic growth and inequality a major fallout of world war ii was the formation in july 1944 of the bretton woods institutions the international monetary fund imf the international bank of reconstruction and development ibrd and the general agreement on tariff trade gatt these created the financial order of the post war world and defined the rules boundaries and goalposts of financial and economic cooperation after the reconstruction of war devastated europe the ibrd morphed into the world bank group the ibrd ifc 1956 ida 1960 icsid 1966 miga 1988 and world bank training institutes which turned its attention to third world countries in 1995 the wto replaced gatt the imf wb wto triad became the world s largest generator and provider of knowledge the fountainhead of economic reform policies and programs they prescribed economic reforms founded on the centrality of economic growth as measured principally by the rate of growth of gdp this ideology of economic progress was taught at all major us and european and later in the third world universities and it created a multitude of indoctrinated economists of all nationalities who educated trained and advised the leaders and the power elite of third world countries this ideology of economic growth on a corporate market consumer basis is neoliberalism promoted annually at the davos jamboree the bretton woods international financial institutions ifis were joined by banks like the asian development bank and the african development bank and ifis from japan and some european countries even lower tier ifi executives had access to the topmost echelons of governments hence ifis became the source of finance for development projects in the third world and also enablers for preparing project proposals and appointing consultants to educate and advise corruptible third world leaders to apply for and receive loans and solicit foreign investments thus expanded banker driven debt economies economic growth as the measure of national progress became the focus of economic thinking and was institutionalised in countries across the globe with impetus imparted and momentum maintained using the political economic clout of the imf wb and other ifis it was accepted worldwide because it suited the elite politician bureaucrat corporate nexus sometimes referred to as the deep state which has behind the screen control of the governments of all countries admittedly much of the knowledge and finance provided for projects resulted in the creation of infrastructural and other assets in third world countries but most of the accruing benefits went to the economically betteroff sections of society to the neglect of the poorer sections with grandiose plans for development calling for huge capital investments and loans from ifis available only on pre condition of undertaking the prescribed economic reforms many third world countries sank into debt some entered a debt trap when the outgo of interest on loans exceeded the revenue from projects plus export earnings overall this resulted in growing economic inequality within and between societies in admission of this an internal study group of the international monetary fund reported in july 2016 that their decades long advocacy and practice of economic reforms had serious failings the report is titled neoliberalism oversold with the boldfaced sentence instead of delivering growth some neoliberal policies have increased inequality thereby jeopardizing durable expansion thomas piketty s 2013 incisive bestseller capital in the twenty first century may possibly have triggered the imf admission need for a different economic model at a recent meeting of the imf and wb efforts were made to play down fears of a slowing global economy due a deteriorating trade climate the key phrases are fears of a slowing global economy and deteriorating trade climate questions which arise are why should there be fear and who feels fear also questions about what effect a deteriorating global trade climate stated to be principally about the economic conflict between usa and china may have on the majority of the globe s 7 2 billion human inhabitants since the talk is global let s view other global matters the global economy being the sum of the economies of the countries on the globe and the economy of a country being the sum of the economies of its constituent states or regions it follows that at the very root of the global economy lies the economy of every human household taking the argument down to the household is justified by the etymology of the word economy which is from the greek word oikonomia referring to household management and thrift with eight of the world s wealthiest persons owning as much wealth as the poorer 50 of humanity there appears a huge justification for an alternative economic paradigm to replace the current one of unending year on year economic growth which has caused unjust and growing inequality within and between nations leading to political military economic confrontation between nations and social unrest within them current economic model put simply even simplistically the current economic model is founded upon the need for growth of the national economy as a means to generate wealth gross domestic product is a measure of the total economic production representing the market value of all goods and services including personal consumption institutional purchases and sales and adding exports and subtracting imports gdp is generally accepted as a comprehensive yardstick for assessing a nation s economic growth and its year on year growth indicates economic health the generation of wealth money precisely by economic growth accrues to the upper economic echelons and this is expected to trickle down to people who live if that s the right word in the lowest economic layers of society this has not happened in any country rather economic disparity has widened politics is slave to economics every government attempts to gain political advantage by claiming a higher gdp growth rate as demonstrative of better performance opposition political parties always attempt to play down the government s performance by contesting these figures even left oriented economists question the validity of the 7 gdp growth rate claimed by the bjp led nda 2 government but do not question the economic model thus economists across the political spectrum have been and are on the gdp growth rate bandwagon and routinely quarrel about figures of gdp growth questioning the computation methods or the validity of the statistical data used for computation there appears to be no understanding that the economic model has failed to provide economic benefits to people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap of humanity political promises notwithstanding apart from the economic model generating economic disparity and social unrest it is unsustainable from other perspectives politics is driven by an economic model that cannot address the here and now economic needs of food shelter health education jobs of vast numbers of people hence elections and voting are a cruel charade a drama scripted by parties and persons across the political spectrum to distract attention from the real life economic miseries of the invisible millions with promises of good days in the future the key agenda must be to accelerate growth is a recent article by none less than former chairman of the economic advisory council to india s prime minister the title and content of which indicates the mindset elections change governments but the economic growth ideology remains and its implementation maintains momentum even accelerates politics remains slave to

washington reuters us retail sales increased in may and sales for the prior month were revised higher suggesting a pick up in consumer spending that could ease fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter the fairly upbeat report from the commerce department on friday followed a raft of weak data including a step down in hiring in may and tame inflation readings that have led economists to believe that the federal reserve will signal a rate cut later this year when policymakers meet next week financial markets have priced in two rate cuts this year driven primarily by a recent escalation in the trade war between the united states and china which economists have warned could undercut economic growth the economy will next month celebrate 10 year of expansion the longest in history although it won t change the view that the fed will feel compelled to ease at some point this year this eases some of the pressure said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto and it is likely welcomed the commerce department said retail sales rose 0 5 last month as households bought more motor vehicles and a variety of other goods data for april was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0 3 instead of dropping 0 2 as previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales climbing 0 6 in may compared to may last year retail sales increased 3 2 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales advanced 0 5 last month after an upwardly revised 0 4 rise in april these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have been unchanged in april consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity the outlook for consumer spending is mixed while consumer confidence remains strong wage growth retreated in may and hiring moderated sharply the dollar rose against a basket of currencies us treasury yields fell stocks on wall street were trading lower the solid gains in core retail sales in april and may suggested consumer spending was gaining speed in the second quarter after braking sharply in the january march quarter that could see economists raising their second quarter gdp growth estimates which are currently below a 2 0 annualized rate the economy grew at a 3 1 pace in the january march quarter after getting a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory exports dropped in april and inventories are expected to be a drag on growth in addition business investment softened and home sales fell in april overall the economy is losing steam as the stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending dissipates a separate report from the fed on friday showed manufacturing production rising moderately in may leaving output down this year production at factories rose 0 2 last month after slumping 0 5 in april manufacturing which accounts for about 12 of the economy is being constrained by an inventory overhang especially in the automotive sector that has left businesses placing fewer orders at factories motor vehicle inventories surged 0 8 in april the commerce department said in another report the trade tensions between washington and beijing are also causing disruptions in the supply chain president donald trump in early may imposed additional tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods prompting retaliation by beijing trump on monday threatened more duties on chinese imports if no deal was reached with chinese president xi jinping by the conclusion of the g20 summit later this month in japan we expect the manufacturing sector to continue struggling in the second half of this year said paul ashworth chief economist at capital economics in toronto last month sales at auto dealerships accelerated 0 7 after dropping 0 5 in april receipts at service stations rose 0 3 building materials and garden equipment sales edged up 0 1 while online and mail order purchases jumped 1 4 sales at clothing stores were unchanged and receipts at furniture outlets nudged up 0 1 sales at bars and restaurants increased 0 7 last month while those at hobby musical instrument and book stores rose 1 1
russian chinese relations have been characterised by increasing intensity of activities at all levels however russia s recent turn to the east has not forced china to turn away from the west in quite the same way for china russia remains a minor partner whose interests china does not intend to take into account in search of a new ally after the spring of 2014 washington together with its european allies announced the first round of economic sanctions against moscow since then russia has been forced to pivot towards the east and more recently africa moscow as a result has remembered its mighty eastern neighbour china which at the beginning of the current decade firmly secured its position as the world s second largest economy now moscow aims to compensate for its losses by building up its relationship with the people s republic in the russian media the topic of russian chinese cooperation has come to the fore and the exchange of delegations and negotiations between the two countries have intensified bitter statistics between 2013 2017 russia s total trade with the world declined from 863 1 billion to 591 7 billion or by 31 4 percent china s share in russia s foreign trade over the same period increased from 10 3 percent to 14 7 percent as a result china has become russia s top trading power squeezing out germany whose position weakened as it joined anti russian sanctions a number of factors hinder the further development of trade between the two countries imports from china to russia steadily exceed russian exports to china in 2016 russian commodity exports amounted to 28 billion and chinese imports to 38 1 billion the negative balance for russia was 10 1 billion and it wasn t much better in previous years bilateral trade is hampered by russia s weak export potential russia mainly exports oil and coal and some raw materials to china another problem is smuggling which is flourishing it is widely known that russia restricts nickel copper and forestry exports to china at the same time only the official data from chinese customs show that in the first half of 2017 russia supplied nickel for 489 million copper for 120 million to china and it is even harder to come by the numbers for forestry exports according to some sources the smuggling trade is controlled almost exclusively by the chinese it is impossible to estimate it even indirectly since the goods are not registered by either chinese or russian customs but move along secret corridors investments according to the central bank of russia direct foreign investments from russia to china are practically non existent as for direct chinese investments in russia their accumulated volume is ridiculously small in the first half of 2018 chinese investors took one billion dollars from the real estate sector of the russian economy and their total investment fell to 3 18 billion considering that the total volume of accumulated foreign direct investment in russia in the middle of 2018 was 526 1 billion it turns out that china s share was only 0 6 percent this is about the same as the united states investments in the russian economy whereas the united states has declared an economic war with russia russia regards china almost as one of its closes allies in its confrontation with america mutual currency deal cancelled the chinese currency the yuan and the russian ruble have a very limited range of uses it s extremely difficult for russian companies with yuan to make serious investments in china as there are quite serious restrictions for foreigners and russian legal entities and individuals in china are perceived as foreigners like the french or americans secondly currencies are valuable when they appreciate whereas for the russian ruble and the chinese yuan an almost permanent weakening of the exchange rate is characteristic for the ruble it is also difficult to predict towards the end of 2018 china refused to sign an intergovernmental agreement with russia on settlements in national currencies one that has been prepared since 2014 the truth is that for china russia is not a strategic partner despite the deterioration of us china relations only the us remains a strategic partner for beijing all of beijing s attention is focused on washington while moscow may only be interesting in terms of the possession of vast territories that the chinese lack washington has warned that third countries that violate sanctions against russia may themselves become subject to secondary sanctions beijing has so far been unwilling to be dragged into secondary sanctions for russia the shanghai cooperation organisation on the political front russia and china along with some central asian countries are members of the shanghai cooperation organisation sco despite the tactical similarities between the countries within the framework of the sco especially in the central asian region relations lack a strategic footing in addition since russia maintains fairly close ties with central asian countries within the framework of the eurasian economic community and the collective security treaty organization for russia these groups are more important than the sco for china the sco is the only secure cooperation structure for developing a leading role in the region as well as a strategic space in central asia for ensuring energy security within the framework of cooperation and development priorities in the sco there are certain differences between china and russia despite the fact that both china and russia are facing a common threat from the united states china does not intend to distance itself from the us and has never considered military cooperation within the organisation as a priority china will not agree to turn the sco into an anti american alliance at least for now china and the united states have close economic relations the us is an important trading partner for china at present china s trade turnover with russia amounts to 95 billion which is 2 14 percent of china s foreign trade turnover according to chinese customs data the trade turnover of china and the usa in 2014 reached 521 billion and with eu countries it was

a us 470 000 debt and the country s interbank market are at the centre of a major row between banks and cambria africa the provider of the paynet transactions portal whose suspension has disrupted millions of transactions guest column newzwire a us 470 000 debt and the country s interbank market are at the centre of a major row between banks and cambria africa the provider of the paynet transactions portal whose suspension has disrupted millions of transactions cambria africa says it suspended services to zimbabwean banks because they owe us 470 000 the company says it lost us 170 000 in march and april and it would be patently irresponsible to continue the company runs paynet a transaction switch used by virtually all banks in the country paynet says it serves 5 800 corporate clients and 2 5 million beneficiaries the suspension could disrupt salaries for over half a million workers while nssa announced on thursday that pensions would be delayed cambria a united kingdom firm listed on the aim market in london wants to be paid in us dollars for its services but banks have rejected this leading to the impasse local banks have instead started working on alternative software to replace paynet a service of cambria subsidiary payserv this has angered cambria which has released a lengthy and strongly worded statement raging at banks in its statement cambria said paynet was suspended after close of business on june 10 due to a collective refusal to pay historical and contracted pricing to payserv africa in us dollars the company says banks have been profiting off its system raking in up to us 22 million in bank fees while cambria took losses the company lost us 170 000 providing services to banks in march and april 2019 banks collectively owe payserv africa over us 470 000 for over four million transactions concluded since may 1 2019 the company cannot allow further accumulation of possible losses the company estimates that in 2018 banks netted us 5 in profit for each dollar invoiced to them collectively in 2018 banks netted over us 22 million in profits via charges to its account holders for services provided by paynet cambria says banks the firm says have stonewalled the company s attempt to maintain the united states dollar value of its services following the devaluation of the currency to rtgs5 86 1 us dollar on the interbank market detailing how it came to its decision cambria says banks including stanbic zimbabwe and the industrial development bank of zimbabwe idbz had recanted on written commitments made prior to may 31 to honour payserv africa s invoices banks insisted on an industry position from the interbank operations committee ioc four days to the deadline for receipt of payment the company has not received a single indication even verbal that payment has been initiated or approvals were being sought or in short a sign from a single bank that they intend to pay in the meantime the banks collectively have run up a bill to payserv africa of over us 420 000 for the period may 1 to june 10 2019 cambria accuses banks of choosing to speak through the ioc which committed its members and perplexingly their superiors to respond to payserv with one voice silence banks on the other hand say foreign currency payments are not possible after the introduction in february of the interbank market a letter to cambria from the head of treasury at fbc bank said the interbank operations co ordinated and led the discussions cambria says cbz standard chartered cabs and nedbank had claimed that they would be barred from paying an external invoice by the rbz however cambria insists that rbz governor john mangudya made a commitment on may 31 that the central bank would not object to banks paying cambria in us dollars but cambria is upset that banks have instead begun exploring alternative software to replace paynet however ten days later it is clear that the intention was to run out the clock and use the time against payserv while attempting to present untested and unapproved alternative software platforms alternative the paynet standoff reflects the dangers of the banking system s reliance on a single supplier commenting on the issue ralph watungwa vice president of the bankers association of zimbabwe said thursday we pay them paynet in us dollars but our argument is that since they are a local business they must be paid locally or they will have to queue up for forex like everyone else to be paid he says individual banks may have to find alternatives for paynent including reverting to manual entries in the interim they were mostly doing salaries but because of this we may have to make other plans anticipating a standoff with payserv standard chartered zimbabwe has started urging its clients to use the straight2bank or s2b application as an alternative to paynet on june 10 cabs told its customers that paynet would be disconnected urging clients to use its own direct inject platform instead but and not surprisingly cambria is warning banks against taking on a new vendor a new system would not be as good as paynet the company claims such an alternative would in the company s view neither be cheap nor immediately available and customisable the 5 000 corporate users of paynet would find it difficult to switch to a new system however robust a new system would require the kind of customisation that paynet has provided to each bank at a far lower cost than would be charged by their core system providers while rationally speaking we should never have reached the stage where banks would want to see who blinks first here we are and none of this is rational particularly when payserv publicly committed us 1 million to develop new technologies for the industry which seems to be shunning it now reflecting the complexity of charging foreign firms in local rtgs payserv s may invoice would mean the company is paid the equivalent of us 2 6 cents per transaction at interbank exchange rates instead of the average of us 16 cents in its contract it would be patently irresponsible for payserv to continue providing a service without payment or to accept 20 cents on the dollar assuming access to the interbank market alternatively payserv would have to at a level predict devaluation and market access for which payserv has no mechanism especially given the 30 day notice period for a price change in our contracts we note again that we have not proposed a price change the company says banks in zimbabwe pay externally for a range of foreign owned technologies in foreign currency including core banking software to microsoft and it is then illogical to accept that banks can pay for such subscriptions licenses and service but cannot pay payserv africa the row between paynet and banks is hitting millions across the country on thursday nssa said pensions may be delayed nssa wishes to advise its valued pensioners under the pensions and other benefits scheme and the accident prevention and workers compensation scheme that payouts that were due on the 13th of june 2019 might be delayed as the provider of the payment platform used by the banks is demanding to be paid in foreign currency failure of which it will suspend services to them earlier this year cambria told shareholders to expect a hit on earnings due to the forex crisis in zimbabwe cambria s net profit increased 50 to a record us 1 66m for the six months ended february 28 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 but revenue fell 4 to us 4 34 million while consolidated earnings ebitda increased 23 to a record 2 06 million from 1 67 million for the same period in last year in april cambria announced that former imf representative to zimbabwe christian beddies had been appointed ceo
