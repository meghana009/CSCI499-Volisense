particularly given the current low interest rate environment as such the total return generated has been lower than initially anticipated although the 6p dividend per annum has consistently been met

ended 30 september 2018 of 1 18 30 september 2017 1 20 have been calculated in accordance with the association of investment companies the aic recommended methodology chairperson s statement for the year ended 30 september 2018 the twelve month period ending 30 september 2018 saw the credit environment change dramatically from one that was very supportive of risk assets to one with frequent headwinds for risk assets but also one that was unsuited to holding risk free interest rate products the spread widening environment that developed in the second half of the period was helpful in providing more attractive investment opportunities and this allowed the portfolio managers pms to accept the issue of more shares in comparison to the previous period consequently the number of shares in issue increased from 160 929 151 to 182 179 151 via taps issues during the year however due to the spread widening the company s nav per share decreased by 3 39 over the period excluding dividends paid as mentioned above market conditions were very supportive for continued spread tightening in the 1st quarter of the period however as us inflation moved higher in january 2018 interest rate markets became concerned that the federal reserve fed would continue to increase the federal funds rate in response treasury yields spiked aggressively higher with the 10yr yield rising from 2 4 at the start of the year to over 3 by the end of april this also spooked credit and equity markets causing correlations to break down with volatility elevated for most financial assets as the year progressed headwinds for risk assets continued to appear with the trump administration aggressively threatening higher tariffs on imports into the us for many of its trading partners and targeted chinese imports in particular in addition to the heightening of geo political risks which put global growth at risk the strong us dollar also negatively impacted emerging markets which sold off aggressively causing contagion into developed markets european assets also suffered from the fallout of the italian general election where an anti establishment coalition was formed and from the weak coalition government in germany while the ongoing brexit negotiations pressurised sterling credit markets the pms and the company s board continue to adhere to a strict discipline of only accepting new share issuance to meet investor demand when there are suitable investment opportunities in the marketplace for the period in question credit conditions were more volatile offering the pms better opportunities to source attractive assets however although new issuance was higher than the previous period the pms remained committed to maintaining the credit quality of the company and not over reaching for risk mark to market performance is expected to remain under pressure especially as the fed remains on a rate hiking course geopolitical risks remain elevated and the european and uk political environment remains fragile however the pms are comfortable that the portfolio is well positioned for this point in the cycle and well protected from rising rates with an interest rate duration currently of just 2 8 years during the reporting period new regulations required all investment companies to issue a key information document kid as with many new regulations there is a settling in period and we welcome the efforts of the association of investment companies to bring more clarity to these documents as with previous periods the quarterly tender facility has operated very efficiently and the small numbers of tendered shares have always been placed at a premium the tender facility is there to provide comfort on liquidity and it continues to be surprising that small tenders occur despite our shares trading at a constant premium claire whittet chair 14 january 2019 portfolio manager s report for the year ended 30 september 2018 economic background sentiment in the last quarter of 2017 saw a continuation of risk markets being supported by coordinated global growth us fiscal stimulus and a strong technical backdrop to markets in the us the federal open market committee fomc raised fed funds by 25bps close to the year end in what was a highly anticipated move and therefore did little to move markets meanwhile president trump finally saw the senate pass his long awaited fiscal stimulus package which gave a boost of longevity to the credit cycle but also added some volatility to us treasury markets as the reforms were considered to have an inflationary bias in europe the european central bank ecb announced another 30bn per month taper from its quantitative easing qe programme although qe was extended until at least september 2018 and it was confirmed that euro interest rates would also remain low until then draghi also followed up with dovish comments regarding inflation later in the quarter elsewhere in the eurozone the independence referendum in catalonia resulted in the spanish government arranging a snap election in the region which failed to produce a positive result either way but was viewed by the market as a favourable outcome as it kept spain unified in the key eurozone election in germany angela merkel struck a deal with the socialists and formed a weak jamaica coalition in early november as expected the bank of england s monetary policy committee mpc reversed the emergency rate cut that followed the uk referendum but governor carney surprised markets saying that two more 25bps rate hikes will be needed over the next three years more stabilising were the results from the bank of england boe bank stress tests which despite being very punitive saw all 7 participating banks and building societies passing comfortably as expected carney confirmed the uk countercyclical capital buffer would be increased from 0 5 to 1 the start to 2018 continued in the same strong vein which enabled credit spreads across all sectors to tighten further however this was brought to an abrupt end as higher than expected us average hourly earnings reared the spectre of inflation concerns resulting in a sharp widening of credit spreads economic data continued to be strong in january and the q4 earnings season kicked off with a decent tone aided by a favourable global picture of upgrades versus downgrades in the year to date however the us wage data then set a weak tone for the risk markets and february was a turbulent month in the us jerome powell was sworn in as the new fed chairman and expressed his belief that the economy was not showing signs of overheating but there was a need for gradual tightening in addition in what is becoming a theme of his presidency president trump announced a raft of trade tariffs including steel aluminium and autos which ultimately resulted in the resignation of white house chief economic advisor gary cohn and fuelled speculation of a full scale trade war tech stocks added to the malaise with a raft of negative stories including weakness in facebook shares due to user privacy concern in europe the quarter ended in uncertainty as the italian election on march 4 proved to be a disaster for former prime ministers silvio berlusconi and matteo renzi opening the door for two anti establishment and euro sceptic parties five star movement led by luigi di maio and league led by matteo salvini in the uk the office for national statistics ons revised down its estimate for uk growth although comments from mark carney suggested that domestic interest rates may go up faster and higher than markets have been anticipating however this was quickly replaced in april when he implied that markets should not necessarily expect a may rate hike which returned support to gilts with the market probability of a may hike dropping from 95 to below 20 at month end the us treasury market volatility remained high at the start of q2 with yields selling off due to a combination of strong earnings headline and core consumer price index cpi data remaining above 2 and some softening of the trump administration rhetoric regarding trade tariffs on the international stage the leaders of north and south korea met for the first time in over a decade and held talks to denuclearise the peninsula and potentially bring a formal end to the korean war despite what was a fairly strong earnings season investor sentiment felt weak throughout may and as a consequence credit spreads drifted wider and the treasury curve continued its bear flattening closing the month at a mere 42 5bps after hitting 77bps in january in italy the five star and league continued their efforts to form a coalition government which seemed on track until the president sergio mattarella refused the coalition s choice of finance minister paolo savona on the grounds of him being too eurosceptic with the coalition partners threatening another election investors sold italian government bonds btps heavily and contagion was felt across all sectors and despite a compromise being found and a government being put in place italian volatility continued through the summer and early autumn in addition the spanish parliament announced a vote of no confidence in the prime minister mariano rajoy who was ultimately replaced by socialist leader pedro sanchez elsewhere emerging markets continued to be under pressure most of the year due to us strength while idiosyncratic risks in turkey saw the lira decline 16 over the first 6 months of 2018 versus the us as inflation soared to 10 85 finally forcing the central bank to break ranks with president erdogan and hike rates by 300bps erdogan won the presidential election late in the year with 52 5 of the vote giving concerns that further restriction on the press and domestic judiciary would be imposed despite the volatility the fed hiked rates for the 7th time in june and added an additional rate hike for 2018 to the dot plots which now have 2 hikes in 2018 and 4 in 2019 while this should have been negative for treasuries the us announced a raft of tariffs on chinese products provoking a similar reaction from china which kept long dated treasuries well bid with this backdrop the market tone was understandably weak despite economic data that continued to be supportive albeit a little mixed the ecb expressed a more dovish tone and extended qe to the end of 2018 cutting the eur30bn of stimulus to 15bn as from the end of september however president mario draghi also emphasised that rates would remain unchanged until at least through the summer of 2019 in the uk the boe as expected kept rates on hold however chief economist andy haldane surprisingly voted in favour of a rate hike taking the voting to 6 3 still in favour of holding but putting the august meeting back in play despite weak markets economic data remained robust in the us ism manufacturing index ism data remained very strong the unemployment rate fell to 3 8 inflation remained above 2 while in the eurozone and uk the weaker weather impacted data from q1 and early q2 receded and the economies were on firm footings the july earnings seasons despite some negative trade tariffs impacts were very positive which provided confidence in the ongoing economic recovery and support to risk assets central bank activity was fairly muted and bank lending surveys in the uk and europe showed commercial banks continuing to support the economies with very little in the way of tightening in the us q2 gross domestic product gdp came in at 4 1 and inflation continued to be muted despite the continuous gradual improvement in the jobs data in addition a constructive meeting between the us and europe on trade tariffs helped credit risk sentiment emerging markets em then took centre stage in august when in turkey the interference by president erdogan in the central bank policy and the reluctance to raise rates saw a huge sell off in the turkish lira with the exchange rate spiking to over 7 try usd from 3 5 a year ago these moves eventually forced the central bank to hike the domestic base rate by 725bps to 24 which helped halt the slide in the lira while the imf released a 50bn loan to argentina to shore up the economy and stem investor out flows helping to improve the tone in em during september as markets restarted following the summer break there was a notable pick up in market activity but all proceedings continued to be dominated by the geopolitical events that have played havoc with investor sentiment for most of 2018 in italy volatility continued when the coalition leaders back tracked on comments suggesting their budget would have a deficit to gdp target below 2 and instead came out with a 2 4 deficit for a 3 year period the ec response was immediate with jean claude juncker drawing a parallel with greece 2011 and the subsequent sell off in btps was severe with the 10yr bonds falling approximately 4 5 points over the month end in the us the fed hiked again which took the upper band to 2 25 a further hike occurred in december raising the upper band to 2 50 and they remain on track for a further 1 2 hikes in 2019 the key 2 10s curve closed the month unchanged at 23 5bps although it did test 20bps mid month which is the flattest it has been in over a decade in the ongoing trade tariff drama the twists and turns keep on coming and september was no different president trump announced a breakthrough with both canada and mexico which appears to lead the way to a workable agreement that was hyped as being a possible replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta which has been so despised by the trump administration likewise an announcement was made that south korea had conceded on key trade barriers but there was still no major breakthrough between the us and china which remains firmly in the spotlight and seen as a key catalyst for the continuation of global coordinated growth performance review investor sentiment remained very positive for the early part of the financial year however the spike in us wage data in january 2018 and subsequent sell off in treasury yields caused correlations to breakdown down and since then a combination of geopolitical risks flattening yield curve and a hiking fed emerging market volatility euro political risks and brexit risks in the uk have all contributed to stiff headwinds for credit markets the headwinds did provide a number of opportunities for the portfolio managers particularly in the collateralised loan obligation clo and bank sectors while the widening in insurance bonds especially in the long dated restricted tier 1 bonds issued in the buyout markets in 2017 also provided the pms with new places to look for value the net decline seen in total comprehensive income for the year to 30 september 2018 was due to the fall in the mark to market valuation of the company s assets over that 12 month period as spreads widened on the assets as referenced in the chairperson s statement the price was pushed lower and reflected the general risk off sentiment that has prevailed for most of 2018 over the same period from 30 september 2017 to 30 september 2018 the price on the ice bofaml european high yield index fell by over 3 points the price on the ice bofaml sterling high yield index fell by almost 4 points and the price of the ice bofaml contingent capital index fell by almost 5 points by comparison the nav of the company declined by just over 3 points mostly due to the pms focusing on shorter duration assets in comparison to the longer dated indices the total return for the year of 3 47 nav per share including dividends paid with positive contributions from all sectors is very pleasing in the context of a very difficult 2018 for credit markets by comparison the total return for the euro high yield hy market is 0 90 gbp hy has returned 2 65 and the contingent convertible coco bond index has returned 1 50 as mentioned in previous reports we remain part of the novo banco note group this represents a very small part of our portfolio and there were no updates during the reporting period foreign exchange accounting the company s policy is to hedge foreign exchange currency risk however the company does not formally designate the hedges or adopt hedge accounting under ias39 any movements in foreign exchange rates are monitored daily and the hedge is adjusted when necessary to ensure that currency exposure remains within strict limits the net foreign currency gains on the portfolio recorded within net loss gain on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and the net foreign currency losses on the forward currency contracts included within net foreign currency loss gain are recognised in accordance with the hedging policy and ifrs within the statement of comprehensive income investment outlook the company was established to take advantage of the liquidity premium that exists in the non government sectors of the fixed income universe as such when necessary the pms may determine it to be prudent to manage excessive duration risk with the use of interest rate swap derivatives but with the natural duration of the company s securities currently below 3yrs there are currently no hedges being applied the pms consider the portfolio to be well positioned even as the credit cycle ages and strategists are favouring a base case of mid 2020 for the next us recession the company was designed to look through market volatility unless there was a big event such as the uk referendum on eu membership and the pms have allowed the bonds to roll down the curve towards maturity to protect the company and the credit spread duration is relatively short at 3 6years since the company s launch in early 2014 the pms have favoured exposure to clos and subordinated bank debt both sectors have performed well over the period being reported on considering the general market sentiment that prevailed and the pms still recognise the relative value imbedded in these sectors compared to their peers in the wider fixed income spectrum as such these two sectors are expected to remain the favoured allocations over the medium term twentyfour asset management llp 14 january 2019 top twenty holdings as at 30 september 2018 credit percentage of

in this regard strategy the strategy for the company is to capture the illiquidity premium that is associated with off the run bond issues as part of the general search for high conviction relative value securities the portfolio manager continually came across interesting investment opportunities but too often these bonds did not offer sufficient liquidity to use in the typical daily mark to market ucits funds however they are suitable for closed ended vehicles by remaining highly selective and without conceding on underlying credit quality the strategy targets a monthly distribution of 0 5p per share with all excess income being distributed to investors at the year end of the company internal controls the board is ultimately responsible for establishing and maintaining the company s system of internal financial and operating control and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness the company s risk matrix continues to be the core element of the company s risk management process in establishing the company s system of internal financial and reporting control the risk matrix is prepared and maintained by the board which initially identifies the risks facing the company and then collectively assesses the likelihood of each risk the impact of those risks and the strength of the controls operating over each risk the system of internal financial and operating control is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and by their nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss these controls aim to ensure that assets of the company are safeguarded proper accounting records are maintained and the financial information for publication is reliable the board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the company this process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of this

s system of internal financial and operating control covering all controls including financial operational compliance and risk management the board has evaluated the systems of internal controls of the company in particular it has prepared a process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the company and the policies by which these risks are managed the board also considers whether the appointment of an internal auditor is required and has determined that there is no requirement for a direct internal audit function the board has delegated the day to day responsibilities for the management of the company s investment portfolio the provision of depositary services and administration registrar and corporate secretarial functions including the independent calculation of the company s nav and the production of the annual report and financial statements which are independently audited formal contractual agreements have been put in place

systems are reviewed by the audit and risk committee at its meetings and annually by the board the board believes that the company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify mitigate and manage the risks to which it is exposed principal risks and uncertainties are set out below principal risks and uncertainties the board is responsible for the company s system of internal financial and reporting controls and for reviewing its effectiveness the board is satisfied that by using the company s risk matrix as its core element in establishing the company s system internal financial and reporting controls while monitoring the investment limits and restrictions set out in the company s investment objective and policy that the board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company the principal risks which have been identified and the steps which are taken by the board to mitigate them are as follows market risk the underlying investments comprised in the portfolio are subject to market risk the company is therefore at risk that market events may affect performance and in particular may affect the value of the company s investments which are valued on a marked to market basis market risk is the risk associated with changes in market prices including spreads economic uncertainty changes in laws and political national and international circumstances while the company through its investments in credit securities intends to hold a diversified portfolio of assets factors such as levels of sovereign debt or political events may have a material impact which could be materially detrimental to the performance of the company s investments under extreme market conditions the portfolio may not benefit from diversification for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements liquidity risk investments made by the company may be illiquid and this may limit the ability of the company to realise its investments for the purposes of cash management such as generating cash for dividend payments to shareholders or buying back ordinary shares under the quarterly tenders or in the market substantially all of the assets of the company are invested in credit securities there may be no active market in the company s interests in credit securities and the company may be required to provide liquidity to fund tender requests or repay any borrowings the company does not have redemption rights in relation to any of its investments as a consequence the value of the company s investments may be materially adversely affected for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements credit risk the company may not achieve the dividend target and investors may not get back the full value of their investment because the company invests in credit securities issued by other companies trusts or other investment vehicles which compared to bonds issued or guaranteed by governments are generally exposed to greater risk of default in the repayment of the capital provided to the issuer or interest payments due to the company the amount of credit risk is indicated by the issuer s credit rating which is assigned by one or more internationally recognised rating agencies this does not amount to a guarantee of the issuer s creditworthiness but generally provides a good indicator of the likelihood of default securities which have a lower credit rating are generally considered to have a higher credit risk and a greater possibility of default than more highly rated securities there is a risk that an internationally recognised rating agency may assign incorrect or inappropriate credit ratings to issuers issuers often issue securities which are ranked in order of seniority which in the event of default would be reflected in the priority in which investors might be paid back the level of defaults in the portfolio and the losses suffered on such defaults may increase in the event of adverse financial or credit market conditions in the event of a default of a credit security the company s right to recover will depend on the ability of the company to exercise any rights that it has against the borrower under the insolvency legislation of the jurisdiction in which the borrower is incorporated as a creditor the company s level of protection and rights of enforcement may therefore vary significantly from one country to another may change over time and may be subject to rights and protections which the relevant borrower or its other creditors might be entitled to exercise refer to investment objective and policy in the summary information for information regarding investment restrictions currently in place in order to manage credit risk for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risk through its investments denominated in currencies other than sterling the company s share capital is denominated in sterling and its expenses are incurred in sterling the company s financial statements are maintained and presented in sterling at year end of the foreign currency investments approximately 48 are in euros and 11 are in us dollars amongst other factors affecting the foreign exchange markets events in the eurozone and u s may have an impact upon the value of the euro and us dollar which in turn will impact the value of the company s euro and us dollar denominated investments the company manages its exposure to currency movements by using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts which are rolled forward periodically for additional information refer to note 16 to the financial statements reinvestment risk quantitative easing resulted in lower yields across all fixed income products and tightening credit spreads this could pose a challenge for the portfolio manager when it comes to reinvesting any monies that result from portfolio asset redemptions and income payments the portfolio manager has recognised this potential challenge and performed ongoing cash flow analysis on the current portfolio encouragingly the redemptions and expected income payments over the coming 12 months do not pose a significant challenge trying to predict market conditions years ahead is notoriously difficult however the portfolio manager recognises there may be a requirement to be more opportunistic in terms of timing for new investments i e aim to reinvest when the market is most volatile and also to remain vigilant to requests for issuance of new shares for further information refer to note 16 to the financial statements other risks and uncertainties the board has identified the following other risks and uncertainties along with steps taken to mitigate them operational risks the company is exposed to the risk arising from any failures of systems and controls in the operations of the portfolio manager administrator aifm and the custodian and depositary amongst others the board and its audit and risk committee regularly review reports from the portfolio manager the aifm administrator and custodian and depositary on their internal controls the administrator will report to the portfolio manager any valuation issues which will be brought to the board for final approval as required accounting legal and regulatory risks the company is exposed to the risk that it may fail to maintain accurate accounting records fail to comply with requirements of its admission document and fail to meet listing obligations the accounting records prepared by the administrator are reviewed by the portfolio manager the portfolio manager administrator aifm custodian and depositary and corporate broker provide regular updates to the board on compliance with the admission document and changes in regulation changes in legal or regulatory environment can have a major impact on some classes of debt the portfolio manager and board monitor this and take appropriate action where needed income recognition risk the board considers income recognition as another risk and uncertainty of the company the portfolio manager estimates the remaining life of the security and its likely terminal value which has an impact on the effective interest rate of the credit securities which in turn impacts the calculation of interest income the board asked the audit and risk committee to consider this risk with work undertaken by the audit and risk committee as discussed in the audit and risk committee report as a result of this work the board is satisfied that income is appropriately stated in all material aspects in the financial statements cyber security risks the company is exposed to risk arising from a successful cyber attack through its service providers the company requests of its service providers that they have appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the risk of cyber attacks including minimizing the adverse consequences arising from any such attack that they provide regular updates to the board on cyber security and conduct ongoing monitoring of industry

of the company s investments and have found them to be reasonable based on the explanations provided and information obtained from the portfolio manager the audit and risk committee was therefore

banks enter the new year under pressure from investors to rethink just how aggressive they can be hiking interest rates a slowdown in the world economy the trade war and skittish financial markets are forcing policy makers including federal reserve chairman jerome powell to express fresh caution about their scope for tightening monetary policy the people s bank of china is also pledging support for its economy that outlook marks a change from last year where a majority of central banks raised rates and the european central bank ceased buying assets of course if economies weather the latest challenges policy makers may need to rethink anew heightened uncertainty about the trajectory for policy normalization and reduced divergence between the fed and the rest are set to characterize the 2019 central bank outlook tom orlikhere is bloomberg economics quarterly review at 24 of the top central banks which together set policy for almost 90 percent of the global economy we outline the issues they face in 2019 and how they might respond the fed spooked markets at the end of 2018 with a projection for two rate hikes in 2019 based on a more optimistic outlook for the economy than investors held policy makers pointed to forecasts continued strong growth and jobs gains while investors fretted over slowing global growth and the ongoing trade war between the u s and china contributing to the unease bloomberg reported on dec 21 that president donald trump had discussed the possibility of firing fed chairman powell out of frustration over the fed s gradual tightening campaign powell has since dialed back his message assuring markets he would be flexible and patient many fed watchers now believe u s policy makers are unlikely to raise rates before june unless data surprises to the upside the fed s communication campaign preaching policy patience calmed the markets down yet just a little patience will not alter the fed s hiking bias the real fed funds rate barely crossed into positive territory in the fourth quarter after sitting in the red since the great recession there is ample room for the fed to continue removing policy accommodation especially if the pace of core inflation picks up above the central bank s target we expect two rate hikes in 2019 yelena shulyatyevathe euro area reached a turning point for monetary stimulus when the ecb capped quantitative easing at the end of 2018 a slowing economy and sub target inflation means the central bank will stay supportive it intends to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of this year economists predict a hike late in the year though investors don t expect one until 2020 much will depend on how the 19 nation economy copes with risks from protectionism and volatility in emerging and financial markets mario draghi s term expires in october meaning he may leave without raising rates as president jockeying for his job has already started with a decision by governments likely after european parliament elections in may inflation has plunged on oil costs posing a risk to pay settlements and the economy has slowed these developments call for policy caution from the ecb assuming growth stabilizes around trend and president draghi passes the baton to a continuity candidate we expect a hike to the deposit rate to come in december 2020 still the risks are skewed toward a delayed liftoff jamie murraythe boj faces a huge test in 2019 as inflation falls further below its 2 percent target exposing the limits of its massive monetary stimulus program some economists see a risk of the core consumer price index falling below zero as cheaper energy and mobile phone charges undermine boj policies january s flash crash in the currency market which brought a sharp and unwelcome strengthening in the yen underscores how much is beyond the central bank s control while stimulus continues to weigh down profits at commercial banks and distorts the bond market a majority of boj watchers expect governor haruhiko kuroda to keep his current yield curve settings in place at least through the end of 2019 with the short term rate locked at minus 0 1 percent and the 10 year bond yield target at around zero percent bond purchases are likely to be pared back further while the boj s presence in the market for exchange traded funds will depend on whether stocks need propping up tweaks to reduce policy side effects are possible but on balance the boj is expected to drift further from its peers as they chart a return to pre crisis policies the looming hike to the sales tax may also complicate matters the boj will need to maintain easing in 2019 with inflation weak and growth under pressure the threat of renewed yen strength as u s treasury yields retreat will also keep it on guard that said sustaining stimulus may grow more challenging financial imbalances are increasing one reason to pull back what s more lower u s yields are putting downward pressure on jgb yields and the further they fall the less the need for boj purchases a challenge ahead for governor kuroda will be to finding a balance between two camps on the policy board the reflationists and those more concerned about the risks from the boj s policy yuki masujima mark carney is starting his final full year as bank of england governor before he leaves in january 2020 he can expect the central bank s outlook to continue to be dominated by brexit especially after the u k formally leaves the european union on march 29 as the deadline nears and the chance of a chaotic exit rises investors have bet there ll be no rate increases in the next 12 months though economists foresee at least one being squeezed in carney has warned that a no deal brexit could drive up inflation that requires higher borrowing costs if the government can get a deal signed in time the market outlook could quickly be rewritten with less than three months until the u k brexit uncertainty is at fever pitch the bank of england won t lift rates in that environment we remain of the view that brexit will be orderly if it is the central bank is likely to waste no time lifting rates the first hike is likely in may and another should follow in november dan hansonthe bank of canada is sticking to its view that more interest rates increases will be needed on top of five hikes over the past two years but there seems to be a lot less urgency than there was a few months ago canada s oil producing regions were hit hard by last year s slide in crude prices leading the boc to sharply mark down the near term outlook for the economy at its latest rate decision it also softened its tone on future moves saying they would only happen over time still the soft patch in growth is seen as a temporary one and policy makers expect the economy to rebound later this year putting them back on the hiking path increasing global risks and slumping energy prices should keep the bank of canada on hold for all of 2019 the housing market and consumer spending may be moderating more than expected and wage growth has softened recently this reduces the urgency for the central bank to stay ahead of inflationary pressures resulting from strong economic growth and a historically tight labor market last year tim mahedyso far it has held off cutting its benchmark rate but the pboc is expected to further ease monetary policy in 2019 as the economy faces a deepening slowdown and the trade conflict with the u s the central bank said it ll keep monetary policy prudent while striking an appropriate balance between tightening and loosening implying a slightly looser stance than 2018 as it ratchets up targeted stimulus if the fed turns more dovish the pboc will face less downward pressure on the currency simplifying its policy considerations the pboc announced on jan 4 to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 100 basis points to be implemented in two steps the central bank also recently widened the company coverage of its targeted rrr cuts in the pboc s annual work meeting the central bank emphasized to keep liquidity reasonably ample and market interest rates reasonably stable the central bank is expected to combine economy wide rrr cuts with measures aimed at unclogging the channels for monetary policy transmission particularly in supporting small and private firms chang shuindia s central bank under a new governor shaktikanta das is likely to prepare markets for an interest rate cut as inflation undershoots the 4 percent medium term target and growth slows weakening consumption due to tighter financial conditions uncertainty over investments ahead of a general election in spring this year and risks to exports from global headwinds are likely to see the reserve bank under das adopt a more dovish stance on monetary policy in the coming months investors in the swap markets are pricing virtually no change in the repo rate a far cry from early october when they were factoring in nearly 100 basis points of hikes to 7 5 percent that is partly because oil india s biggest import has slumped and the rupee asia s worst performing major currency in 2018 has stabilized along with expectations that the fed may pause in its rate tightening cycle external risks to the economy have receded prompting the central bank to train its attention in domestic factors like slowing growth and inflation the reserve bank of india s current stance of calibrated tightening increasingly at odds with falling inflation and slowing growth is no longer tenable with inflation continuing to undershoot its target the central bank is likely to veer policy towards a pro growth stance ahead we expect the rbi to deliver a 25 basis points rate cut during its february review reverting its policy stance to neutral we expect the new governor to correct the undue hawkish bias of the central bank under his predecessor urjit patel in favor of a more data dependent approach in 2019 abhishek guptacentral bank chief nominee roberto campos neto will be in a comfortable position when he takes over the reins of the the monetary authority following his expected senate confirmation in february under the government of jair bolsonaro inflation is running below target and the benchmark interest rate stands at an all time low of 6 5 percent following a series of faster than forecast deflation data analysts have been cutting their outlook for the benchmark interest rate economists surveyed by the central bank now expect the so called selic rate to rise a mere half a percentage point this year and some even think it may remain unchanged throughout 2019 for 2020 it is expected to increase another percentage point depending on how much traction brazil s economic recovery gets under bolsonaro s planned structual reforms the coast is clear for bcb to hold the target overnight rate at 6 5 for the time being as inflation remains tamed and risks are tilted towards lower growth the election of market friendly president bolsonaro also helped as it removed tail risks in economic policy prior to election rate markets were pricing in fear of a currency meltdown and fiscal disarray although we do expect a gradual normalization to start at end q3 we do not rule out stable rates through end 2019 a few factors might weigh on the near term prospects for rates in brazil developments in the global environment progress or lack thereof on the reform front and as usual eventual surprises on growth or inflation finally a new bcb governor takes office next february the incoming governor is market friendly but it is too soon to tell whether he will have the same cautious approach to policymaking as his predecessor adriana dupitathe bank of russia has a history of hawkishness with both rate hikes in the last three meetings surprising most forecasters now russia is facing short term inflation risks thanks to a vat increase that kicked in on new year s day and the ruble is taking a pounding along with the oil price in a move that looks like shooting the messenger president vladimir putin signed a law in december that bans currency exchange offices from displaying rates to passersby but perhaps the biggest uncertainty in russia is the threat of further u s sanctions with tensions flaring again over the arrest of an american in moscow on spying charges geopolitics is never far from the central bank s thoughts governor elvira nabiullina said at her final 2018 press conference that a return to rate cuts will only be possible at the end of this year while internal and external factors may encourage russia s cautious policy makers to continue to tighten the bank of russia begins 2019 with its finger on the trigger policy is already tight enough after last year s hawkish turn yet inflation is on a steep upward trajectory and the central bank won t tolerate surprises another rate hike could come in february or march if the acceleration proves unexpectedly swift or if fresh sanctions rattle the ruble easing could resume once temporary influences begin to fade but that s unlikely to happen until the end of the year scott johnsonthe south african reserve bank s november rate increase may give it room to support economic growth by holding the benchmark rate at 6 75 percent until at least the third quarter before it tightens further while the central bank s quarterly projection model prices in four more rate increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2020 and inflation was at an 18 month high in november price growth expectations cooled since the middle of december as a stronger rand and the drop in oil brought down energy costs the composition of the reserve bank s monetary policy committee will change this year a stronger rand and lower oil prices will depress south africa s inflation in the first half of 2019 this will weaken the case for tightening monetary policy a new configuration of the monetary policy committee following the resignation of deputy governor francois groepe and the expected addition of one or two members also injects uncertainty into the rates outlook mark bohlundmexico s central bank is about to undergo a transformation as two new members tapped by leftist president andres manuel lopez obrador are set to join the five person board while not enough to shift the majority away from its hawkish voting pattern banxico s been raising rates for three years now the discussion within the central bank will likely become far more divided once the two members are ratified by the senate as early as this month banxico will still have to contend with inflation that s hovered stubbornly above the 2 percent to 4 percent target range along with new challenges posed by an administration that s planning to spend far more on social programs that s led some economists to see rates rising this year to a record high from its current 8 25 percent for now the median forecast in a bloomberg survey shows rates stabilizing until they slowly come down starting in the second half of the year the central bank will keep tight monetary conditions inflation and inflation expectations remain high and together with risks of second round effects from supply shocks and accumulated peso depreciation imply additional rate hikes cannot be ruled out the two board members appointed by president andres manuel lopez obrador this year are unlikely to share the concerns about economic policies proposed by the new government that contributed to rate hikes late in 2018 the remaining three board members will keep the majority bloomberg economic expects banxico to maintain interest rates at 8 25 until late in the second half when lower inflation and weaker activity could allow to start easing monetary conditions felipe hernandezbank indonesia was one of the most aggressive central banks last year raising rates six times for a total of 175 basis points as it sought to counter an emerging market rout and protect a sliding currency the rupiah has since recovered from a two decade low and while the central bank has made clear it s prepared to take further action on rates in a bid to keep pace with the fed expectations are the tightening cycle may be coming to an end with a presidential election set for april cost of living is set to be a key focus for the government putting pressure on the central bank to keep a lid on inflation while inflation has been relatively subdued and well within the target band of 2 5 percent to 4 5 percent the election could add to price pressures the other key consideration is the current account deficit which leaves indonesia vulnerable to outflows should sentiment dive again and which has seen the government taking steps to curb imports and boost exports bank indonesia s work to stabilize the rupiah may be complete having lifted its policy rate by 175 bps in 2018 in december it appeared more inclined to lean on direct intervention in the currency market rather than tighten further what s more the fed subsequently signaled greater flexibility on policy in 2019 even so bank indonesia is likely to retain a tightening bias until government measures to slash the current account deficit bear fruit the presidential election in april also looms which prolongs investor uncertainty in a goldilocks scenario where the u s and china cement a trade deal bank indonesia might be able to unwind some of its rate hikes before the end of the year tamara hendersonturkey s consumer inflation rate is finally dropping after the immediate impact of last year s currency slump began to dissipate but it still remains more than four times the five percent official target and the slowdown in prices isn t as fast as the collapse in private consumption typically the biggest driver of growth in the middle east s largest economy the combination of a high inflation rate and severe economic slowdown leaves the turkish central bank in an awkward place on the one hand it must keep monetary policy tight to maintain the price trajectory it targets for this year on the other gross domestic figures for the third quarter of 2018 show the economy could be in need of some kind of stimulus the slump in activity spells trouble for president recep tayyip erdogan ahead of municipal elections in march but there is little monetary policy action could achieve in such a short period of time any possible steps to ease access to liquidity will be critical to the fate of the lira and to turkey s corporate sector which relied heavily on fx financing and is now struggling to service foreign debt after the lira s collapse the central bank has restored some credibility with an aggressive 625 basis point hike in the repo rate in september the lira has strengthened since then after a tumultuous summer and lower oil prices helped inflation to fall from its october peak assuming no further meltdown in the currency we expect 550 basis points of rate cuts in 2019 as inflation continues to moderate ziad daoudnigeria s central bank has kept its key rate at a record high 14 percent since july 2016 and indicated it will maintain a tight monetary policy stance to tame above target inflation price risks stemming from increased spending ahead of the february election and the possible deregulation of fuel prices could trigger an interest rate increase in march the central bank may see a change in leadership this year when governor godwin emefiele s first five year term ends in june cbn governors and deputies are appointed by the president and can serve a maximum of two five year terms but traditionally only serve one a new governor is unlikely to alter the policy trajectory significantly meaning a continuation of existing policies to tame price growth defend the naira and build up reserves the naira s peg to the u s dollar is likely to return as the main priority of the central bank of nigeria in 2019 as oil revenue and foreign investment dips a hike in the policy rate is possible in 2019 but the cbn may opt for other ways to maintain the peg such as open market operations we do not expect godwin emefiele to continue after his current term as cbn governor end in june mark bohlundthe bank of korea raised its key interest rate for the first time in a year in november while a majority of economists forecast another 0 25 percentage point increase in 2019 this isn t assured and some have suggested that a cut is possible if economic conditions deteriorate governor lee ju yeol and his policy board continue to weigh competing concerns that will become increasingly challenging this year accommodative policy is needed to spur sputtering growth and inflation that remains below the 2 percent target yet a widening interest rate gap with the u s creates the risk of capital outflows and counts in favor of tighter policy record household debt is another thorny problem for the central bank which must not push borrowers into trouble by raising rates too much while being sure not to encourage too many new loans with cheap money the bank of korea is likely to keep its policy rate on hold at 1 75 through 2019 in our view the central bank hiked by 25 basis points in november 2018 in a bid to reduce financial imbalances and rebuild policy space the year ahead looks more challenging with heightened external risks and muted inflation likely to keep the bok on an extended pause two things though could shift the calculus any changes in the pace of fed tightening and any shifts in u s china trade relations justin jimenezthe rba is likely to remain on the sidelines for the first half of this year but its patience will be tested after a two month hiatus its next rate decision in february will be closely watched for comments on what s fast becoming a key worry plunging property prices a 11 1 percent slide in the price of sydney housing from the peak peak helped turn around market bets on the next policy move with traders now seeing more chance of a cut than a hike this year australian households are among the world s most indebted and the rba s worried that a prolonged housing slump will drag on consumption still this is somewhat uncharted territory house prices are falling while the economy is still growing just above its speed limit and the jobless rate is near the lowest in almost seven years that helps explain why the rba as recently as december reiterated that the next rate move is still likely to be up risks to australia s economy and monetary policy in the last two months became two way with the drop in house prices becoming much more pronounced even so more recent positive external developments china s further stimulus the fed s greater flexibility and signs of progress on trade between the u s and china should help stabilize sentiment without the rba having to act lending rules were also eased from jan 1 by year end we expect remaining hurdles for the start of gradual policy normalization to be cleared in particular the investment climate should be less challenging and wage growth is likely to have ticked higher a rate hike as soon as december cannot be ruled out tamara hendersonsaudi arabia s currency peg to the dollar and the fact that its main export crude oil is priced in dollars means that its interest rate tends to closely track the fed though the kingdom s economic recovery remains fragile the central bank has given little indication it would change course this year the saudi arabian monetary authority doesn t have major decisions to make the currency peg to the dollar means that interest rates closely follow the fed s they raised the repo rate by 100 basis points in 2018 another 75 basis points of rate hikes are expected in 2019 ziad daoudargentina s central bank no longer sets inflation goals and now lets daily bond auctions determine its benchmark rate under the terms of a revised agreement with the international monetary fund policy makers led by guido sandleris are targetting monetary aggregates in a bid to freeze the expansion of pesos in the economy the new strategy amounted to a sharp monetary tightening as argentina s money supply was expanding at about 2 percent a month before the policy change the benchmark interest rate was at a world high 60 percent since then inflation expectations have somewhat moderated but still at very high levels consumer prices are expected to increase 28 7 percent over the next 12 months bcra no longer sets the interest rate but it has a critical role in creating conditions for markets to lower the near 60 leliq so far the institution delivered on its ambitious plan to keep monetary base stable and we expect it to remain committed to this policy ars s non intervention zone is set to increase at a slower pace which can help bring down inflation expectations still under pressure should the ars move below the non intervention zone bcra is allowed to purchase dollars and such non sterilized intervention can lead to lower market based rates this benign cycle is however rather dependent on both international market conditions out of bcra s control and the prospects of fiscal policy influenced by the forthcoming presidential election in october hence even if bcra plays by the book volatility may be high in both currency and interest rates adriana dupitasince shocking markets in january 2015 by abolishing its minimum exchange rate the swiss national bank has kept policy on hold sticking with the lowest rates of any major central bank and a pledge to intervene in currency markets if necessary although the economy grew at an unusually strong pace in 2018 the franc also rallied against the euro on the back of investor unease about italy and other political turmoil with the ecb pledging to keep borrowing costs in the neighboring euro zone at rock bottom through next summer the snb is very likely to stick with current policy for the foreseeable future to avoid exacerbating pressure on the franc president thomas jordan and his colleagues have also grown more dovish on the inflation outlook giving them ample space to keep policy accommodative sweden s central bank ended last year by raising its benchmark rate for the first time in seven years with consumer price growth and inflation expectations solidly back at the 2 percent target the majority of the governing board members felt comfortable enough to take another step in removing the record stimulus unleashed over the past four years the central bank now anticipates that it will raise rates again in the second half of this year and then two times next year but investors such as pimco and the major swedish banks are doubtful it will be able to pull off an exit as economic headwinds build governor stefan ingves and his colleagues will also over the coming meetings need to decide on whether to keep reinvesting its massive balance sheet after a june end date norway s central bank is preparing the next step in a gradual shift away from extreme monetary stimulus predicting a second interest rate increase again in march after suffering through the worst oil crisis in a generation the economy of western europe s largest exporter of crude is now growing above trend petroleum investments are expected to boost the economy this year with unemployment holding steady at 4 percent but the recent swoon in oil prices and the global slowdown could keep policy makers in oslo from not straying too far ahead of their colleagues in frankfurt and stockholm governor adrian orr remains firmly in wait and see mode and there is little prospect of a change in stance this quarter the economy has cooled and inflation remains benign supporting orr s call for rates to be held at a record low well into 2020 while data are sufficiently healthy to make the chances of a rate cut look remote further policy easing cannot be entirely ruled out orr has shown himself to be growth focused a dove in comparison to his hawkish predecessor as well as those on the international horizon downside risks include the rbnz s plan to force banks to hold bigger capital buffers which could slow lending the reserve bank of new zealand is signaling steady interest rates through this year and into 2020 the rbnz s neutral policy bias reflects both upside and downside risks to growth and inflation even so keeping the policy setting at an expansionary level for a considerable period signals greater concern about growth than inflation in our view inflation in 3q moved toward the center of the 1 3 target but growth through the third quarter was well below the reserve bank s estimate of potential private investment has stalled in line with the souring in business confidence though household spending has picked up we expect the rbnz to leave the official cash rate unchanged at 1 75 in 2019 tamara hendersonpolish interest rates on hold at a record low of 1 5 percent since may 2015 probably won t be changed until the end of the term of this monetary policy council in 2022 central bank governor adam glapinski revealed that scenario in early january extending the longest ever pause in rates past the earlier projected horizon for the end of the decade despite annual gross domestic product growth of above 5 percent and rapidly rising wages inflation has remain subdued amid low oil prices and a freeze in domestic electricity tariffs while glapinski has acknowledged that inflation may be slower and growth stronger he sees a stronger probability of rates staying unchanged the czech central bank one of the global front runners in lifting borrowing costs interrupted its tightening push in december to gauge the impact of its record series of interest rate increases the five hikes last year were a reaction to weak currency which has failed to cool the economy in which a robust wage growth has been fueling consumer demand and inflation pressures policy makers are again expecting the koruna to gain this year and tighten conditions for businesses and they said that absence of currency appreciation could allow more hikes the central bank says the benchmark should continue rising to bring real interest rates from negative to neutral levels but it said decisions on further hikes will be more difficult than in 2018 that s partly because the export reliant nation could be exposed to global risks such as trade protectionism and brexit and an overdone monetary tightening may constrain the economy too much methodology based on median estimate in monthly or quarterly survey where available or most recent collected forecasts all interest rate and forecast data is as of jan 14
the operational guidelines also take care of third party and exclusive collateral held by a bank central banks enter the new year under pressure from investors to rethink just how aggressive they can be hiking interest rates a slowdown in the world economy the trade war and skittish financial markets are forcing policy makers including federal reserve chairman jerome powell to express fresh caution about their scope for tightening monetary policy the people s bank of china is also pledging support for its economy that outlook marks a change from last year where a majority of central banks raised rates and the european central bank ceased buying assets of course if economies weather the latest challenges policy makers
similarities and differences eea and nafta courtesy the european economic area eea is a unique economic union with the aim of promoting free movement and free trade to 28 member countries while backing and encouraging strong economic partnerships the north america free trade agreement nafta is a free trade treaty between the united states mexico and canada with an aim of removing trade barriers between the three countries encouraging investment and the movement of goods across borders while the eea was originally created to foster economic cooperation nafta has remained purely economic both are aimed at fostering economic growth in key areas but the eea and nafta are different beasts in terms of scope reach and implementation the eea was created in 1994 to facilitate trade and movement partnerships of the member countries of the european union eu and the european free trade association efta countries currently belonging to the eea include those listed in the graphic below while switzerland s entry was rejected in a 1992 referendum and remains outside both the eea and the eu but retains a number of bilateral agreements with the eu allowing it to participate within the market the eea differs from the eu in that it has no participation in the common agricultural or fisheries policies but it does rely on four freedoms that form the bedrock of the european single market the freedom of movement of goods people services and capital regulating the activities of the eea member countries is left to the eu it s the eu s involvement that has seen the uk consider the prospect of severing their association with these european trade agreements entirely however the eea s importance was highlighted when this potential outcome was reported when it was announced in november 2018 that the uk could leave the eu without their pre agreed trade deals the pound sterling fell by almost 1 11 against the euro to 1 14 strengthening the bloc s single currency the volatility hasn t stopped amidst uncertainty and confusion the pound has since dropped to lows of 1 11 in forex trading those with a forex account are well aware that of the many things that can cause a significant shift in a currency s strength is its nations ability to make imports and exports as well as government policy and employment figures north american free trade agreement nafta nafta is a trade agreement between canada the united states of america and mexico and was created in 1994 after years of discussion revision and finally ratification it was released to eliminate certain barriers to trade and investment between the three countries this included the elimination of tariffs from goods going into the us from mexico and from the us into canada in september 2018 it was announced that nafta was being replaced in 2020 by the united states mexico canada agreement usmca one of the biggest benefits of nafta was that it severely reduced the import costs for all three countries which helped to reduce the risk of inflation and enable interest rates to remain low maintaining steady oil prices and food prices between 1993 and 2017 trade between the three countries quadrupled to over 1 trillion the free trade agreements have now been being restructured but the trilateral pact has been preserved albeit under a new name usmca with slightly different provisions within the same overarching principle the three main sticking points for the us wanting to renegotiate this deal is whether nafta created or destroyed american jobs improved or negatively affected average wages its environmental impact and its impact on immigrants into the united states despite these issues the usmca agreement is effectively a new trade deal one of the main differences is having an end point unlike nafta which had an indefinite ending this one has a sunset clause ending in 16 years time key differences in the agreement include a greater access to canada s dairy market for the us and automotive industry protection although the removal of trading blocks for canadian lumber imports into the us remain in place as free trade agreements go these are the two biggest in the world together they incorporate over a billion people producing nearly 40 trillion worth of gdp they are primarily in force to protect and promote their economies and encourage greater economic growth through trade and reduction of import costs as a total the eea has a total population of 518 330 149 people with total gdp of 17 688 553 million 17 68 trillion resulting in an average gdp per person of 34 126 with a current debt ratio of 81 99 of gdp this is slightly less than the current nafta partners who have a combined population of 486 061 000 people with an annual gdp at 22 285 400 million 22 28 trillion gdp per capita of 45 849 and a debt ratio of 100 61 of gdp for a trade agreement to work it requires all member countries to cooperate so with just three members making up nafta disagreements will be more highlighted than an agreement including over 28 countries like the eea however they are also more likely to be more economically beneficial especially when it focuses on just the trade interests of three countries to consider the eea overcomes this by having a one rule for all policy for members operating within a single market economy rather than separate rules and regulations that still operate within canada and the usa similarities and differnces between eea and nafta courtesy both were founded with the aim of creating free trade zones whilst simultaneously fostering economic growth and enhancing economic ties both were created from previous agreements in the case of nafta the canada united states free trade agreement and the forerunner for the eea was the eec both have been criticised by its members many in europe seeing the disparity for poorer member states nafta has seen criticism too from the us who argue the deal isn t fair to the country they have renegotiated and renamed it usmca which will take over in 2020 while the main goal of the eea was to create a single market all governed by the same rules and regulations including the free movement of goods and services nafta s main goal is the elimination of barriers preventing trade and investment between canada mexico and the us the core principle of the eea was the free movement of persons giving the right to citizens of all eea members the opportunity to work live study and establish business in other member countries nafta only makes temporary arrangements for business visitors traders or investors to move freely and there are different rules that apply to canadian and mexican citizens visiting the us the eea is an obvious extension of the economic social and political goals of the eu under the auspices of a single european marketplace nafta is a purely economic agreement between its members in terms of trade disputes settlement procedures customs law rules of origin and the elimination of economic barriers at its heart bilateral and multilateral trade agreements have three benefits for members firstly they promote and facilitate easier trade relationships and partnerships secondly they increase the relative wealth and gdp of their populations and thirdly they reduce the likelihood of conflict the eea is a much more complex and wide reaching agreement than nafta as it touches on almost every aspect of its members livelihoods and businesses including wages currency tariffs free movement of goods services and people nafta on the other hand is a more economic focused multilateral trade agreement which ultimately promotes more trade between members reducing import costs protecting rules of origin and securing more trade by reducing external imports from countries outside of nafta ultimately the eea has jurisdiction and regulatory bodies ensure rules and regulations are maintained by all member countries while nafta can only initiate dispute settlement procedures promote and protect intellectual property rights and uphold customs law
we cannot predict what will happen next in economies or markets but 2018 had the feel of a transitional year volatility which in our view had been muted for an unexpectedly long period of time returned in force during the year first in february and then again in the fourth quarter the turmoil and uncertainty drove some investors out of the equity market this was an understandable reaction to pain but selling into a falling market often erodes a portfolio s long term value we have an all season investment approach that sees a purpose in all phases of the market cycle down markets are a time for planting seeds by buying shares and up markets are a time for harvest economic overview many world economies continued to grow in 2018 some quite strongly but there were clear signs that the decade old recovery from the global financial crisis had reached a late stage profits were at peak levels and slack in the world economy as measured by unemployment rates was low we interpret these trends to mean that a lot of the cyclical recovery is behind us during the year the fed raised interest rates four times and the european central bank and bank of england began to unwind years of quantitative easing along with the trade dispute between the united states and china and other geopolitical strains the tightening trend contributed to an upsurge in market volatility at various points during the year the msci eafe index and the s p 500 index were down approximately 20 and chinese stocks fell 32 1 at the close of 2018 unemployment rates in the major economies of the world the united states the uk germany china japan were below where they had been in 2007 we think unemployment rates reflect the level of economic confidence in the immediately preceding period late 2017 was a time of very high confidence relative to history in 2018 we did not see tighter financial conditions translate through to particularly deep recessions it was only in the most extremely impacted areas like turkey and argentina that we saw economic activity decline but there were other troubling signs during the year bank stocks in most large jurisdictions outside the united states japan europe china generally traded below book value given that this occurred at the peak of the economic cycle it raises questions about the health of the world s financial architecture we may think of stock indexes as generally grinding higher over time but this is not always the case recent volatility notwithstanding the s p 500 index ended 2018 well above its level 20 years earlier but outside the united states the picture is quite different the msci eafe index moved sideways for 20 years with volatility at year end it was at virtually the same level as in 2013 and 2007 united states the us economy was buoyant in 2018 lifted by high levels of confidence and late cycle stimulus from the tax cut interest rates rose from a low level and the fed tightened policy in each quarter of the year with the european central bank and the bank of japan keeping interest rates close to zero the resulting interest rate differential raised the value of the dollar unemployment fell to 3 7 a generational low risk awareness which had been scarce in the american investment markets in 2017 made its presence felt in 2018 volatility as measured by the cboe s vix index spiked in february and climbed again in the fourth quarter investors were concerned about rising interest rates the flattening of the yield curve both rising and falling oil prices the killing of a saudi journalist and the evolving trade dispute with china among other developments at one point about 75 of the companies listed on the new york stock exchange were trading below their 200 day moving averages 2 although the economy was still hitting on all cylinders investors were clearly less confident that the recovery would continue in the years ahead china the chinese economy entered a more complicated phase in the last 18 months as the government tried to reduce the country s burden of debt china first reined in bank lending and then began to curb its shadow banking system as a result monetary growth in china was cut nearly in half from 15 to about 8 over the last 18 months 3 in the short term taking on debt can provide strong economic stimulus as evidenced by recent levels of gdp growth in china imagine that you need a 2 000 square foot home but you borrow money and build a 10 000 square foot house instead in the short term that s going to be great for growth in the local community and it may be great for your confidence but once the mega mansion is complete it has to be maintained and the debt you took on to build it has to be serviced your future growth is going to be more constrained because you can only grow through your savings this could be a shock to the local community which depended on the jobs you created think of all the infrastructure china has built much of it has certainly been helpful but some of it arguably has been built ahead of the country s needs and now has to be maintained this diverts capital that could be more produc tively deployed elsewhere apparently china s immediate response to this chal lenge has been to ease fiscal policy but there is now so much debt in china s economy that it may not be able to turn this spigot back on imf statistics suggest that fiscal deficits in china have nearly doubled at a macro level we think china is reaching a stage where it needs to live with a more modest pace of debt growth china s trade position is another source of stress the country s trade surplus has been shrinking for some time and in the first half of 2018 china reported a trade deficit the tariff debate with the united states is happening on top of that yet another concern for china japan despite its high level of sovereign debt and the challenges of an aging popula tion japan has had a level of political stability that is quite notable relative to the rest of the world as we look bottom up at companies in japan we ve been satisfied to see on average an improving trend in corporate governance with many companies returning more capital to shareholders by raising their divi dend payout ratios in japan we see many companies structuring themselves to be resilient by trying to strengthen their market position and capital structure and by behaving prudently we see a similar trend in other regions too but it is particularly pronounced in japan a lot of japanese companies have enough net cash on their balance sheets to cover several years of expenses and capital spending on a macro level we were not unhappy to see the japanese govern ment abandon its 2 inflation target which had eluded it for years european union the political situation in europe became more complicated in 2018 after the election of emmanuel macron as president of france there was hope that a new centrist path would be forged in europe but people forget that macron defeated two political parties to get into power his popularity is now very low and he s having to deal with protests over his economic agenda in italy we ve seen the election of a populist coalition that s openly flouting the eu s budgetary rules we ve also seen the attempts to forge a compromise on brexit end in a messy stalemate that s not particularly attractive for anyone and we ve seen angela merkel lose her power base and status in germany europe as a region in our view has needed a degree of financial repression its currency is depressed its current account surplus is very large and its real interest rates are extremely low there has been little flexibility regarding the restructuring of bad debts this issue has been particularly pronounced in coun tries like italy but even the german banks have not been immune the european market has defied top down categorization the euro stoxx 50 index is trading roughly where it was 20 years ago but we ve seen a bifurcation within the market with some quality businesses grinding higher and trading at full valuations while some banks and other more vulnerable businesses have traded much lower europe has been one geography that at least theoretically has had scope for improvements in confidence in the underlying economy unemployment rates are a lot higher than they are in the united states directly after the global financial crisis eu policy was less stimulative than us policy and as a result the fiscal position in europe is by and large a little healthier than in the united states p e ratios and price to book ratios have been lower these facts have generated a fair amount of enthusiasm for europe within the investment community but as bottom up investors we have always cautioned against forming a generalized view of any region as a whole we ve also noted that companies of similar quality are similarly priced in europe and the united states finally a lot of the valuation discounts in europe have been in the financial sector and in companies that have vulnerable capital structures or could become victims of financial repression conceptually there are some positives for europe at a macro level but we d reinforce that bottom up markets are much more nuanced and the integration of the european experiment is far from perfect finding opportunities in 2018 increased market volatility created opportunities for us to invest as prices of attractive stocks came down to levels that offered us a margin of safety in price we invested in diverse companies some that we already owned and others that were new to the portfolio these included consumer staples companies that sold off because rising treasury yields made them less appealing as bond proxies energy stocks that declined with the falling price of oil european construction related businesses that lost ground because of expectations that economic fundamentals would weaken luxury goods retailers that declined because of fears of falling chinese demand and holding company stocks on several continents that fell because of growing risk aversion as we put money to work our cash level in the global fund drifted down from around 20 to approximately 12 our gold position came up to the 12 to 13 range during this period of weakness in the gold price we believe our positioning is still fairly cautious as we think about the decade ahead 4 we don t try to predict what markets will do but we have a sense of déjà vu because both 1998 and 2007 were also difficult environments for value stocks and both were precursors to the market starting to discount more structural issues based on these past instances we don t expect a very favorable environ ment over the next four or five years but as in those earlier periods we stand ready to take advantage of emerging opportunities one stock at a time cash or gold when investment opportunities become scarce it s been our practice to sit in cash and cash equivalents but cash in what currency we are troubled to see that most of the world s currencies including the us dollar are in questionable health the united states has a large current account deficit and an increasing fiscal deficit and the dollar has been held aloft by interest rate differentials holding dollars or other currencies is not as risk free as conventional wisdom would indicate in most countries the rate of money supply growth exceeds the interest rate investors can earn from government bonds holding these currencies is like owning a stock that pays a 2 annual dividend while shares outstanding grow by 5 per year today sovereign debt to gdp ratios are already at generational highs and when governments have too much debt they have an incentive to keep interest rates low relative to nominal growth this means that governments now need prospective financial repression more than ever unfortunately no man made asset is risk free we see gold by contrast as nature s defensive perpetuity gold has had its valu ation peaks when the system was in distress such as during the global financial crisis when our system was in question and the eurozone was on the brink of breaking apart the early 1980s after stagflation and two oil shocks and the great depression although it may be the least exciting asset while stock markets are roaring as in the past handful of years the late 1990s the late 1960s and the 1920s gold has historically been a store of value when needed most while most businesses and governments have net debt that compro mises the promissory value of their securities gold is unencumbered it has no management team and it is not subject to ill conceived political experiments at a macro level unlike man made money gold is scarce and stable in supply in 2018 we enlarged our position in gold and gold related securities a time for active management developments in 2018 reinforced our sense that investment returns are likely to be less robust in the period ahead than they were through most of the last 10 years in strongly rising markets many investors choose passive vehicles that allow them to participate in market gains while paying minimal fees in sideways moving or slowly rising markets active managers may become more valuable to the extent that they can distinguish stronger stocks from weaker in falling markets active managers who focus on reducing risks may be able to help insulate investors against the full force of the market downturn while potentially taking advantage of opportunities to buy what they believe are attractive stocks at discounted prices on first eagle s global value team we have a long standing commitment to active investment management in 2018 when some investors and firms were gravitating toward passive approaches we made further investments in our team of securities analysts we wanted to be ready to meet the greater chal lenges that could lie ahead in the next phase of the market cycle we deepened our capabilities by adding talented professionals with varied expertise who share our convictions about active value investing many of our clients also share these convictions

the world is unprepared for a key event that is certain to happen soon the next global financial crisis david lipton an international monetary fund imf senior executive warned of this danger in comments to the financial times at the american economic association s annual meeting in atlanta georgia the next recession is somewhere over the horizon and we are less prepared to deal with that than we should be said lipton indicating that the world is less prepared than it was for the 2008 crisis lipton said that too many nations had ignored the imf s warning to fix the roof of their economic houses while the economy was still relatively stable and conditions were favorable now it is feared that their window of opportunity has closed but like many of you i see storm clouds building and fear the work on crisis prevention is incomplete he said at a banking conference earlier in the year an economic crisis now would be a very different crisis from the one in 2008 one reason is that trust in the american dollar is disappearing even at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis which originated in the united states global investors viewed u s treasuries as the safest asset available said benjamin j cohen a professor at the university of california no one doubted that the u s was the epicenter of the global financial crisis but rather than flee the u s capital actually flooded into it this was because of the credibility of the american government now views are changing the geopolitical environment is the most dangerous it s been in decades eurasia group a political risk advisory company warned in its annual report the main reason pax americana is over commenting on america s weak will and global retreat eurasia group made this dire prediction 2019 could turn out to be the year the world falls apart u s alliances everywhere are weakening the limited trust that underpins the u s china relationship appears to be gone said the group commenting on the outlook for nato the g 7 the g 20 the world trade organization and the european union eurasia group said that every single one of these is trending negatively and most in a way that hasn t been in evidence since world war ii the imf views the trade war between the united states and china as the biggest threat to economic stability referring to the gathering economic storm lipton said countries should be paying attention to keeping their economy on a level trajectory building buffers and not fighting with each other what eurasia group and the imf describe aligns specifically with what bible prophecy says will happen in the near future while the bible does not set specific dates for prophecies to occur it does tell us specific world conditions to watch for these conditions will precede the worst time of suffering ever but also the end of that suffering and the return of jesus christ we see these prophesied world conditions today all of our forecasts are based on bible prophecy just like the plain truth magazine before us herbert w armstrong editor in chief of the plain truth warned us that america s decline as a superpower would reach the point where it would hardly be relevant on the world scene he also warned that a global financial crisis would be the force that would help fulfill a major bible prophecy the unification of 10 european nations creating a european superpower mr armstrong personally spoke to otto von habsburg the late european statesman who played a key role in early efforts to unify the continent mr habsburg agreed that it would take a financial crisis to unite europe how could such a crisis come about germany relies heavily on exports and america is one of its largest partners it does not take complex analysis to understand that if america were to stop buying german goods germany s economy would suffer deeply we have seen a small preview of this in germany s recent economic slowdown industrial production fell 4 7 percent by the end of the year imports and exports also fell and the economy contracted by 0 2 percent from july to september if this continues it will soon be labeled as a recession adding to germany s woes is the usual trouble with the euro which has consistently failed to meet expectations for growth an article on the website realclearmarkets quotes part of a report by bessemer trust which gives this appraisal of the euro s disappointing performance on its 20th birthday the best that can be said of the euro the european currency used by 19 countries is that it has survived two decades after being introduced in 1999 it has not achieved its central goals increasing economic growth and strengthening public support for european political institutions eventually we re going to have another u s recession then we ll see whether europe s governments banks and businesses can withstand the pressures created by high debt and low economic growth and whether the euro can still survive if you follow the news on europe it is clear that the euro will be heavily affected by an american financial crisis that crisis is bound to happen soon to discern what the future holds the trumpet looks at not only economics but above all the sure word of bible prophecy believe it or not the bible prophesied of financial ruin for america in this age because of our national sins see deuteronomy 28 mr armstrong believed that a financial crisis in america would be the catalyst for the fulfillment of a far deadlier prophecy europe s transformation into a 10 nation superpower trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry wrote about mr armstrong s bible based forecast showing how what he warned of is being fulfilled in exact detail for decades europe has tried to unify economically militarily and politically but it has been unable to do so the european union consists of 28 loosely allied fairly disunited states in that respect it has been a spectacular failure mr armstrong made a personal prophecy about this regarding how the european superpower would finally unite i think it is the greatest personal prophecy he ever made because it is being fulfilled today exactly as he described it mr armstrong found otto von habsburg to be an important figure in the development of the european superpower the two men became associates habsburg was a member of the european parliament and a descendant of the habsburg dynasty which ruled the holy roman empire for centuries mr armstrong told mr habsburg that europe would indeed unite in the modern era and he told him how he thought it would happen in the face of a drastic crisis and that crisis would be financial mr habsburg said he agreed that the catalyst for unification probably would indeed be a financial disaster in 1984 mr armstrong wrote that a massive banking crisis in america could suddenly result in triggering european nations to unite as a new world power larger than either the soviet union or the u s more than three decades later this personal prophecy of mr armstrong is about to be spectacularly fulfilled you can know the results of the impending financial crisis with much more certainty than any financial analyst to find out how you can avoid the suffering this collapse will cause and how jesus christ s return will bring permanent solutions to this world of financial woes read how the global financial crisis will produce

few months global markets have visibly entered the phase transition zone a process of critical transformation that will eventually lead to a new equilibrium at significantly different levels after severe ruptures and a possible full cycle market crash rather than a short term correction in a structural bull market or a temporary turmoil in healthy economic conditions this is the beginning of a structural adjustment after a decade of liquidity abundance and market manipulation which reflexively changed the structure itself of the market for private investors in hazardous ways making it insensitive to fundamentals passive or quasi passive overly correlated and overly concentrated in a word fake markets have now reached their nemesis and have woken up from a long lethargy fake markets are defined as of mid 2017 as markets where the magnitude and duration of artificial flows from global central banks or passive investment vehicles have managed to overwhelm and narcotize data

recent times something we have not seen in a while marking a definite shift from previous years of market docility over the past quarter various attempts at justifying market dynamics based on traditional market analysis and handy narratives have neatly failed in rapid succession in november market weakness was blamed on a suddenly imploding oil price after a 2 year period of stability and

legitimacy of market panic and likely lead to no different end results the idea that markets got disappointed by a fed on autopilot instead of a data driven fed is relevant but too easy a common rationalisation no more than other fickle ex post narratives at play markets are no longer in the fed s hands either way the spell is mainstream investment strategies face a tougher new year in the short term a rebound in stock prices is likely based on statistics for previous cases of heavily oversold market conditions fund flows for retail investors selling and institutional investors buying also seem to indicate that a temporary turn of fortunes for troubled markets is likely as recently indicated by jpmorgan however again it is unsafe to apply statistics on non normal market conditions what is true most often than not is a vicious trap during phases of regime change every crash will necessarily go through a failed buy the dip by definition picking up dimes in front of a steamroller just because statistically it worked out fine may be ill fated during end of cycle market shifts in systems theory parlance far from equilibrium dynamics applying to systems crossing critical thresholds which then transition across their basin of attraction after a long period of system degradation and over extension due to self amplifying positive feedback loops a system in transition after hitting capacity constraints in synchronicity tends to behave chaotically dislocations and price anomalies become the new normal until the transition to a new attractor is completed and a new equilibrium emerges it now then gets complicated for a number of mainstream investment strategies who are predictably not designed to recognise market conditions as abnormal by construction

crisis alpha they are trusted upon for we discussed it in a recent chat with other market practitioners during the naked short club link rapid inversions of the price action constantly putting them on the back foot asymmetry skewness of moves before potential gap downs and flash crashes the shape and tempo of price dynamics will likely not be kind a market looking to clear pain levels as is typical of illiquid august markets needless to say these are generic considerations for the broad categories of investment strategies and exceptions apply if anything it will be the ideal market environment to prove one s worth as a strategy and capacity for true alpha in frail and now broken markets rich in anomalies and acting oddly while in transition the one historical analogue to fear is not so much 1987 where automated trading exacerbated a market downfall but rather the quant quake in august 2007 at that time renowned quant funds including the famed goldman sachs qis fund lost 30 in short order without any apparent reason perhaps as is proposed it was due to over crowding across similar positions and across funds of a different nature and a fast liquidation breaking out somehow somewhere that spread across as a pandemic still to date nobody knows with certainty what the trigger was a decade has gone by and the jury is still out which speaks volumes of market brittleness that fast crisis moment could play again in rehearsal soon except with a 10 fold impact and more durably than for a few days only given that the basic ingredients of over crowding and over correlation have now percolated across investment strategies of most types for those interested we analysed market behaviour for different clusters of investors in several previous notes amongst which here and here the tree of positive feedback loops below attempts at putting them together in a single place reverse engineering how their systemically relevant high correlation built up over time inevitably incomplete but it gives the idea of where it all emanated from source slide 21 triggers for market chaos a timeline for q1 2019 here below we draw a tentative timeline for key events in what is likely to be an action packed new year on exhaustive list just a few obvious suspects given our overall view for market system instability it becomes crucial to monitor upcoming catalyst events as any of them may be able to accelerate the large adjustment we anticipate inflammable market structure the list of catalysts starts with a non catalyst no trigger needed the market structure itself remains top of the pile of concerns to us a prolonged period of qe nirp and manipulation of price discovery for risk assets has morphed the structure and micro structure of the market itself heavily affected correlation across investment strategies created over concentration on a few juggernaut asset managers motivated a shift into passive and quasi passive investment biases increased retail s access to markets and made their fickle behaviour ever more relevant these self reinforcing loops make for an inflammable market environment which may implode on its own devices under its own weight at some tipping point in close proximity trump factor the mueller investigation will come to a conclusion in the next few months with revelations likely to damage the trump presidency in full or in part especially now that democrats control the house to an extreme the case may affect the longevity of the trump presidency at which point the chances to see him going down quietly without a fight are slim when boxed in a corner the president may be compelled to engage in tactics to redirect attention away from domestic issues this includes geopolitical confrontations with china or russia or any other less obvious frontline given that the equity bubble postponed its deflation thanks to tax cuts from an assertive trump administration in full control any change to that working assumption has immediate and violent ramifications for asset china s gdp and trade war us china growth numbers out of china will be high on the watchlist this year as they may accelerate global softness in economic indicators in this respect trade wars with the us may find a respite in the short term after a deal may be engineered where both sides give concessions in a politically face saving manner however the confrontation with china is real and destined to last for a long time it is not the fleeting caprice of president trump it resonates far and wide across american society from ai to cyber security to copyright infringement to political and military influence globally the size of china a 13trn economy is such that globalisation can no longer simply grow the pie bigger for all rather it becomes a race for a bigger slice of the stalling pie the reach for global hegemony is on and pressing at a time when china s ascent is self evident and overtaking the us economy in size within the next decade at current rates time is up to do something to tame it in line with the well known thucydides trap s dynamics thus we expect trade tensions to escalate in the years ahead and affect china s growth rates such growth rates affect global gdp as they contributed a big chunk of its growth in recent years which in retrospect affect global risk assets additionally china growth rates may have a dramatic impact on an economy over burdened with debt and running fast towards a minsky point the moment of debt saturation where income does not even cover interest rates expenses let alone capital and where a deceleration in credit expansion is all it takes to set the tall pile of debt on fire in the short term clearly the first moment to watch is the agreement which is being discussed and should be revealed soon at the end of february the truce on tariffs agreed between china and the us expires and tariffs will increase on another 200bn worth of imported goods from china the other moments to watch are the releases of china s gdp growth numbers analysts fear a slowdown to 6 2 from 6 7 to us it seems an awfully high number anyways and one which is easy to use for shock value the base is set so high that the potential for a surprise effect looms large on what have now become less complacent moody markets trade war us europe the calendar of key events includes the ruling of the us commerce department expected for february which may slap tariffs on automobile imports if considered to be a national security threat such designation would avoid a technical breach to wto rules german car manufacturers would be more directly impacted but ramifications go beyond that to include a fully fledged trade war with europe and a final blow to the relevance of international committees such as g 20 or incidentally the wto will run out of the minimum three judges quorum by december should the us keep blocking appointments which would eliminate a key dispute resolution mechanism for global trade disputes european parliament elections the dissolution of the european monetary union and its eur peg across member states is far from inevitable yet as we argued in recent years it stubbornly keeps on standing right alongside a well defined trend line when extrapolating the linear trend of political and economic events from the last decade populism grew year after year within the union and far broader than that with each new year we can say that it is larger than the year before and reaching power in more countries than it did in the year before the direction of travel is unmistakable again a de construction of the eur peg is far from unavoidable but no new year in the last five has helped avert it in recent times we added to the list a wholly populist government in italy diminished macron and merkel presidencies more political rioting in central and eastern europe and a more assertive and non integrationist nordics bloc led by holland the new hanseatic league link here below is the chart on populism within the eu which we first presented in 2016 linearly interpolating the trend it would show populism to stand around 60 70 at present times incidentally it is higher than that in italy today according to various estimates source why the eur peg is likely to break sept 2016 link in and by itself the union remains an unfinished project inherently unstable and structurally unsustainable as with all things unsustainable it will eventually stop if one is to judge by stein s law the best chance of recent times stood with president macron as he envisioned the only alternative path forward for the union that was proposed and an idea for restructuring it so to address its most severe flaws and make it more sustainable his voice remained isolated falling on the deaf ears of chancellor merkel despite it being offered at a propitious time of relative momentum in the eu economy and early in macron s presidency where political capital is more easily spent two years later the idea seems dead in its tracks president macron is past his prime facing urging domestic issues and a nose diving popularity chancellor merkel is on her final legs and no longer able to help form a strategic vision assuming she ever wanted true integration while the opportunity was wasted italy got clearly and durably out of line with the eu status quo regime now leading a resurgent movement of anti eu sentiment across the continent restructuring the eur peg may be seen at some point down the road as the lesser evil to take to preserve the eu construct which we all desire in this light european elections in may will be a key event to watch well and beyond brexit we view brexit as an overly hyped topic unlikely to create havoc even in the case of a hard brexit in our opinion the hard non consensual brexit remains itself an unlikely scenario the real vulnerability lies with the union brexit is only a dot in a long standing trend line of events which have progressively vandalized the union s weak foundations in the long term european elections may be far more damaging than any shape or form of brexit in determining the future direction of the eu its long term vision if any and therefore its ultimate fate inverted us yield curve the fed will not cut deposit rates anytime soon while long term rates can fall further on equity weakness the us curve is already inverted in the 2 5yr segment and it is only 15 basis points far from inversion in the 2 10yr part inverted curves have historically been correlated to upcoming economic recessions to which they proved to be remarkably consistent predictors although the debate runs vibrant when it comes to define causation links a recent study link of the st louis fed analyses why an inverted yield curve might itself cause a recession in addition to predict one firstly through the banking channel as banks are likely to cut back on lending when they cannot lend higher than they borrow at which in turn puts brakes on economic activity secondly banks showed a tendency to tighten lending standards in the presence of inverted curves given the more uncertain economic outlook and subsequently lower risk tolerance thus an inverted yield curve might do more than predict a recession it might actually cause we may want to add to the list another factor in the recent cases of curve inversion 1980 1990 2000 2006 the curve was inverted but at much higher overall levels of rates signalling broader manoeuvring space for monetary policymakers this time around inversion happens at closer to the zero bound than before inverted curves and the lower leverage available to policymakers to manage those curves may convince banks that the information content of such curves is even more significant curtailing lending further when cash returns more than long term investments be it bond coupons equity yields or capital investments such as plants and machineries the incentive is high to stay in cash the dynamic slows down spending and investing further curtailing economic growth less lending less spending this will therefore be an interesting dynamic to watch over the course of 2019 at a time when the risk of a us recession is top of the list of concerns in investors mind ukraine turkey elections 2019 will see a few key election rounds in addition to european elections ukraine and turkey local in march indonesia afghanistan and india in april south africa in may likely and argentina in october ukraine and turkey are particularly relevant in ukraine military confrontations with russia have quietly resumed ever since last november and are unlikely to fade until the next presidential elections at the end of q1 given the time overlap with the muller investigation coming to a head in the us and approaching european elections any flare up in hostilities is likely to be met with a prompt response and therefore carries a double weight coincidentally at the end of february the ultimatum of president trump on russia on the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty will also expire triggering a 6 month notice to end its commitment to the 1987 treaty a potentially relevant mix of events making bloated headlines in thin skin oil price it could be a wild card in 2019 trump wants it low to help us consumers and provide the equivalent to a tax cut his emphasis exponential technological innovation makes it super low and obsolete in the long run which should always be thought of as a long term attractor an inescapable ultimate destination at below 20 a barrel end of qe deprives commodities of its strongest bidder during the last decade something which should not be forgotten a strong dollar correlates well with a weak oil global growth hitting a soft patch would further undermine global demand the retreat of the us from syria softens the chance of a confrontation with iran and with it the geopolitical risk premium that oil deserves the visibly diminished role of opec and saudis in setting oil prices at the margin is a trend set to continue this is all the more relevant as energy and commodity stocks have been rather resilient in recent times despite markets in turmoil and may adjust in gap at some point soon saudi itself is at some risk in such a scenario including the usd sar the critical transformation hypothesis before we go to finish on a cheerful note we reiterate our basic view the critical transformation hypothesis in a big long nutshell we believe that systemic risk in financial markets are best analyzed through the prism of complexity science using the analytical tools available to non linear socio ecological systems where a shift in positive loops comes in anticipation of a dramatic transformation chaos theory and catastrophe theory can then help shed light on the current set up in markets years of monumental quantitative easing negative interest rates monetary policy affected the behavioural patterns of investors and changed the structure itself of the market in what accounts as self amplifying positive feedbacks the structure of the market moved into a low diversity trap where concentration risks of various natures intersect and compound approx 90 of daily equity flows in the us is today passive or quasi passive approx 90 of investment strategies is doing the same thing in being either trend linked or volatility linked a massive concentration in managers sees the first 3 asset managers globally controlling a mind blowing usd 15 trillion at more than 20 times the entire market cap of several g20 countries approx 80 of index performance in 2018 is due to 3 stocks only a handful of tech stocks so called market darlings are disseminated across the vast majority of passive and active investment instruments the morphing structure of the market under the unequivocal push of qe zirp new age ideologism is the driver of a simultaneous overvaluation for bonds and equities twin bubbles according to the most reputable valuation metrics these twin bubbles are unmatched in modern financial history so measured against most valuation metrics ever deemed reputable a condition which further compounds potential systemic damages the market has lost its key function of price discovery its ability to learn and evolve and its inherent buffers and redundancy mechanisms in a word the market has lost its resilience it is therefore prone to the dynamics of criticality as described by complexity science in copious details this is the under explored unintended consequence of extreme experimental monetary policymaking a far from equilibrium status for markets is reached a so called unstable equilibrium where system resilience weakens and market fragility approaches critical tipping points a small disturbance is then able to provoke a large adjustment pushing into another basin of attraction altogether where a whole new equilibrium is found in market parlance a market crash is incubating and has been for a while while it is impossible to determine the precise threshold for such a critical transition zone within a stochastic world it is very possible to say that we are already in such phase where markets got inherently fragile poised at criticality for small disturbances and where it is increasingly probable to see severe regime shifts fragile markets now sit on the edge of chaos this is the magic zone theorized by complexity scientists where rare events become typical that said what is a risk is also an opportunity the opportunity to position oneself to capture the moment of adjustment draws nearer it may happen faster and more brutally than most anticipate the signposts are scattered around us in plain sight our thoughts are expanded upon in this video slideshow event information cfa society for those of you who are in london on the 12th of march please know that fasanara will hold a presentation on market resilience at the cfa society uk details of the event are available at this link the following topics will be covered how the morphing structure of the market is the driver of a simultaneous overvaluation for bonds and equities twin bubbles which has no match in modern financial history existing risk management frameworks and the systemic risks that follow how we can use the disciplines of complexity theory for clues on how to update existing frameworks the quest for a quantitative indicator of system level market fragility how using the system resilience indicator sri as a feedback measure helps see how over extended the market instability has gotten to in recent years we look forward to seeing you there best wishes for 2019 article by fasanara capital

blue tower asset management commentary for the fourth quarter ended december 31 2018 providing an update on joban kaihatsu the global value strategy composite returned 17 10 gross 17 34 net for q4 despite the decrease in market price we believe the underlying values of our individual portfolio businesses have continued to grow this year this quarter experienced a sharp increase in market volatility leading some to question if the almost 10 year long bull market has come to an end this past december was the worst december in the us stock market since 1931 and yet it also included the largest ever one day point gain in the dow jones industrial average get our activist investing case study get the full activist investing study in pdf q3 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc much of this volatility is due to the uncertainty of future fed actions the federal reserve has guided that 2019 will have two 25 basis point rate increases and 600 billion of treasuries removed from their balance sheet however this appears to be very aggressive in light of recent equity and bond market declines interest rate futures are pricing in that rate increases are unlikely in 2019 part of the issue here is that the fed bases decisions on us economic data but their actions have huge impacts on the global economy the amount of foreign debt priced in dollars has increased dramatically in recent years the strengthening of the dollar relative to other currencies over the past two years was a major factor in this year s rout of emerging market stocks while historically a strong dollar would make emerging market exports more competitive relative to american competitors the growing popularity of em dollar denominated debt causes a rising dollar to increase companies liabilities while their local currency assets remain stable making the companies less solvent and reducing net equity values trade war concerns were also a significant factor to emerging market investments while our us stocks outperformed the overall us market we were dragged down by international holdings as 2018 saw a large international selloff this flow of capital has not been due to deterioration of the current fundamentals of our portfolio companies but rather due to foreign capital flight in japan according to survey data released by the tokyo stock exchange1 foreign investors pulled out 5 7 trillion 53 billion usd from the public equity markets this is a larger capital flight from the japanese stock market than any year since the collapsing of japan s asset bubble in 1987 the effect of this appears to have been more magnified for microcaps and small caps than for the overall japanese equity market all of our japanese stocks have market caps under 1b usd and most under 100m usd investors appear to have already priced in a recession that is yet to occur and the nikkei 225 is trading at price to book multiples it has not seen since 2012 our european investments in germany and russia have also been hit by a significant decline much of these declines in foreign markets may be due to concerns over trade disputes involving the us and also brexit negotiations i will provide an update on our largest two foreign positions sberbank of russia and joban kaihatsu further below it seems far from certain that we will be eminently entering a recession as there are mixed indicators in each direction us unemployment remains at fairly low levels and high job growth has continued with the labor participation rate increasing corporate earnings in the us are hitting record highs the university of michigan s study of consumer sentiment for the us recorded a higher result for 2018 than any year since 2000 on the negative side consumer spending declined slightly in japan in the 3rd quarter industrial output growth in the eurozone has slowed down in december 2018 there was not a single issuance of a high yield corporate bond in the us the last time this happened was in 2008 2009 financial crisis it is also noteworthy that the us is engaging in heavy deficit spending late in the business cycle combined with the balance sheet reduction policies of the federal reserve it is unclear how global credit markets will react to so much us government debt being dumped on them currently there is a great inversion in the yield of international treasuries relative to the us overnight fed funds rate with the 2 4 federal funds rate being greater than the 10 year bond yields of almost all developed economies while we need to remain cognizant of global economic forces that could affect our portfolio businesses our strategy for portfolio construction remains a bottom up process a collection of well managed businesses with a competitive edge that are trading at bargain valuations will do well over the long term regardless of macroeconomic factors these recent drawdowns and the underperformance of the value factor in stocks are a necessary component of what makes value investing as a strategy work well over time if value investing provided great returns in every environment there would be a crowding effect of the strategy and its outperformance would disappear sberbank sberbank has posted their highest ever per share earnings in their public history and next year is expected to be even better introduction of improved technology and increasing efficiencies have allowed sberbank to increase their revenues while reducing expenses and headcount as part of a recent government policy that encourages state owned corporations in russia to target a dividend payout ratio of 0 50 if their liquidity needs allow it sberbank has been increasing their dividends their dividends payout is tempered by the additional goal of targeting a tier 1 capital ratio2 of 12 5 current ratio is 11 9 in 2019 the russian finance ministry expects sberbank s total dividends to increase 55 from their 2018 level to a total of 420 billion rubles 6 28 billion usd 3 this translates to 19 5 rubles per share a yield of 9 9 based on the january 11th closing price the bank s return on equity has grown to an impressive 23 3 despite these excellent results the company s stock declined 17 3 and the ruble declined 17 1 against the dollar for an adr return of 36 in 2018 update on joban kaihatsu japanese stocks were cheap before and have become even cheaper after recent declines construction demand appears to be weakening in northern japan but remains robust in the rest of the country however japanese prime minister shinzo abe is planning additional infrastructure spending as a form of stimulus4 this would be especially helpful for joban kaihatsu as the declining levels of government reconstruction work in northern japan have led to a gradual decline in the company s backlog of construction projects in the early twentieth century ben graham considered by many to be the father of value investing built his career on investing in net nets which were stocks where the share price is lower than the current assets of the business reduced by total liabilities buying these stocks at such a low price would allow investors to have a profit if the business were to be shut down and liquidated these investments were sometimes called cigar butt investments as they were seen as a discarded failed business that still had some value to extract in much the same way that a discarded cigar may have a few puffs of tobacco left over time as corporate governance standards have improved and value investing methods have been popularized the population of net nets has almost disappeared i bring up the subject of net nets because for six trading days in december an amazing thing happened with joban kaihatsu the company s stock traded at a discount to their net cash position roughly 4970 share giving it a negative enterprise value while such occurrences are already quite rare for businesses in general they usually occur in failed cigar butts where poor management makes extracting the cash value difficult it is very rare to see this occur in a company like joban kaihatsu a highly profitable business with returns of equity in the high teens that pays a significant dividend over the next two quarters we expect the company to generate earnings totaling between 900 1300 per share with an ev ebit of 0 1 and in consideration of the other characteristics of the business we believe that joban kaihatsu remains one of the cheapest stocks in the world exits this quarter this quarter we exited our positions in express scripts aetna and credit acceptance aetna and express scripts were both acquired after their mergers were approved by regulators as we predicted earlier this year for credit acceptance cacc our sale was due to signs that the company was becoming more aggressive with their underwriting as can be seen in the declining forecasted collection rates and due to the increasing valuation cacc has more than doubled from when we added it to the global value composite in q2 2017 a lender becoming more aggressive late in the business cycle is a risky move we still believe the company has a quality differentiated business model and may buy it again if the valuation becomes sufficiently attractive as we discussed in our last letter we made the decision to use the msci all cap world index as the benchmark for performance comparisons going forward using a us equity benchmark when slightly over half of our investments are overseas was not ideal thank you for your continued trust and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns best regards andrew oskoui cfa portfolio manager

exports from russia to the kyrgyz republic diesel fuel for kumtor is sourced from separate russian suppliers the diesel fuel price assumptions were made when the price of oil was approximately 60 per barrel crude oil is a component of diesel fuel purchased by the company such that changes in the price of brent crude oil generally impacts diesel fuel prices the company established a hedging strategy to manage changes in diesel fuel prices on the cost of operations at the kumtor mine the company targets to hedge up to 50 of crude oil component of monthly diesel purchases exposure other material assumptions were used in forecasting production and costs for 2019 these material assumptions include the following the mount milligan processing facility continues to have access to sufficient water supplies to operate year round at the intended capacity this includes management s expectations of annual average precipitation reduction in water losses deferrals to the sands and gravels that we continue to successfully draw water from existing permitted water wells identify and access new water wells available for permitting and capture permittable water sources from within the existing operations guidance assumes that mount milligan will pump water from nearby philip lake rainbow creek and meadows creek after receiving approvals of amendments to the mount milligan s environmental assessment certificate and related permits the company and the kyrgyz republic government government continue to work constructively to complete the kumtor strategic agreement the government does not take any actions that are contrary to the strategic agreement and or the kumtor project agreement and which have a material adverse impact on the kumtor operations and the kyrgyz proceedings are not reinstated or progressed contrary to the terms of the strategic agreement and or the kumtor project agreements the mine plans expertises and related permits and authorizations at kumtor which have been received to date for 2019 are not withdrawn and that any further approvals are obtained in a timely manner from relevant governmental agencies in the kyrgyz republic any recurrence of political or civil unrest in the kyrgyz republic will not impact operations including movement of people supplies and gold shipments to and from the kumtor mine and or power to the mine site any sanctions imposed on russian entities do not have a negative effect on the costs or availability of inputs or equipment to the kumtor project any political issues in turkey do not have a negative effect on the öksüt project the movement in the central valley waste dump at kumtor initially referred to in the annual information form for the year ended december 31 2013 and in the lysii and sarytor waste dumps does not accelerate and will be managed to ensure continued safe operations without impact to gold production the buttress constructed at the bottom of the davidov glacier continues to function as designed the company can manage the risks associated with the increased height of the pit walls at kumtor the dewatering program at kumtor continues to produce the expected results and the water management system works as planned the pit walls at kumtor and mount milligan remain stable the resource block model at kumtor and mount milligan reconcile as expected against production grades and recoveries at kumtor and mount milligan remain consistent with the 2019 production plan to achieve the forecast gold and copper production the kumtor mill and the mount milligan mill continues to operate as expected including that there are no unplanned suspension of operations due to among other things mechanical or technical performance issues there are no changes to any existing agreements and relationships with affected first nations groups which would materially and adversely impact our operations there are no unfavourable changes to concentrate sales arrangements at mount milligan and roasting arrangements at the langeloth facility there are no adverse regulatory changes affecting the kumtor and mount milligan operations and the company s molybdenum assets

the violent repression against demonstrators protesting brutal neoliberal policies which has resulted in more than 300 people being killed by regime forces since april 2018 is just one of the reasons why different leftist social movements have condemned the nicaraguan regime led by president daniel ortega and vice president rosario murillo the left has many more reasons to denounce the policies of the regime to understand this we must go back to 1979 the sandinista revolution 1979 saw the victory of an authentic revolution in nicaragua that combined a popular uprising self organization of cities and neighborhoods in rebellion and the action of the sandinista national liberation front in spanish frente sandinista de liberación nacional fsln a political military organization inspired by a marxist guevarist castrist model the revolution put an end to the 42 year long authoritarian rule of the somoza dynasty which had appropriated the state its armed forces administration and significant parts of its economic assets and established a strong alliance with the united states the somoza dictatorship proving to be an effective bulwark against progressive political forces whose multinationals could maintain and increase their plundering of nicaragua s national resources in exchange for commissions which added to the increasingly important wealth of the somozas the fsln was founded in the 1960s as a leftist group opposing the government mainly through guerilla warfare it was not until some of its guerillas spectacularly took high ranking members of the nicaraguan ruling classes as hostages in december 1974 that it was considered a potentially serious threat to the somocista dictatorship earlier that year liberal fractions of the bourgeoisie opposing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the somoza ruling clique had already formed the democratic union of liberation in spanish unión democrática de liberación udel under the leadership of pedro joaquã n chamorro cardenal editor of the liberal newspaper la prensa to try and gather political momentum in favor of the liberalization of the regime after the stunt of the sandinista guerillas the regime declared a state of emergency increased its repressive grip over the nicaraguan society and hunted down the fsln faced with increasing difficulties the fsln eventually split into three factions the prolonged people s war faction stayed loyal to the strategy of accumulating forces in the remote areas until they would have enough strength to liberate entire regions of the country and launch a final assault against somoza s army the proletarian tendency emerged in order to challenge the prolonged people s war strategy considered not to be adequate given the absence of a permanent occupying army hence the rural populations would not directly witness the imperialist endeavor and would not massively join the guerilla and the development of a capitalist mode of production in the country the economic development of the 1950s and 1960s had given rise to an agricultural and an industrial proletariat which constituted respectively 40 and 10 of the active population by 1978 the proletarian tendency therefore focused on organizing mass working class organizations in urban areas and gaining the support of industrial workers with the perspective of launching a swift insurrection when the conditions to do so would be met finally the terceristas whose main figures included daniel ortega and his brother humberto also advocated for an insurrectional strategy but were open to tactical alliances with the liberal fractions of the bourgeoisie opposing somoza while the proletarian tendency stressed the need for a mass uprising and for self organization the terceristas displayed substitutist tendencies which implied that an armed insurrection led by organized guerillas without a simultaneous mass uprising would be sufficient to overthrow the regime and take power eventually the regime lifted the state of emergency in 1977 thinking the guerilla was defeated and the conditions for entering negotiations with the liberal opposition were met but fsln groups were prompt to resume their armed actions in urban areas in january 1978 the murder of pedro joaquã n chamorro cardenal by regime s soldiers was caught on video and sparked anger among the liberal opposition as well as among the toiling masses a general strike supported by the liberal bourgeoisie was launched while fsln groups staged armed actions against somoza s national guard in august another general strike was called while sandinista guerillas staged an assault against the national palace where a joint session of both chambers of the parliament was taking place taking hundreds hostage which successfully resulted in the liberation of several political prisoners from somoza s jails more importantly spontaneous uprisings took place against the regime enabling the left to gain momentum over the liberal opposition this culminated in several urban uprisings in september 1978 after the fsln called for insurrection while these uprisings were severely defeated by the national guard they scared away the liberal opposition whose representatives sought to enter negotiations with the regime mediated by the us dominated organization of american states oas the terceristas denounced it and withdrew from the broad liberation front in spanish frente amplio opositor fao which they had constituted together with the liberal opposition paving the way for the reunification of the three sandinista currents in january 1979 somoza turned down the proposals of the liberal opposition the momentum was then with the sandinistas who dominated the new patriotic national front in spanish frente patriótico nacional fpn created in february 1979 and in which the liberal opposition was marginalized after reuniting the fsln called for a general strike to be held in june and prepared a broad military offensive to be launched at the same time the population effectively accompanied these actions through mass urban uprisings as the armed insurrection quickly liberated areas of the country one after the other somoza s army largely decomposed and when its last stronghold in the capital was finally liberated on july 19 1979 its last remnants had no choice but to flee abroad in particular to the neighboring country of honduras now in the government the revolutionary political forces among which the fsln was dominant pledged to install a democratic regime to guarantee a non alignment of nicaragua s foreign policy thus putting an end to the alliance with the united states and to develop a mixed economy in which the development of cooperatives and state owned enterprises would be encouraged while the existence of private capital would not be fundamentally threatened as long as it was perceived as patriotic that is loyal to the sandinista revolution rather than to the overthrown somocista regime or to us imperialism during the first two years following the revolutionary victory several developments made the case of nicaragua different from other cases in which the left has come to power through elections in latin america including chile in 1970 venezuela in 1998 1999 brazil in 2002 2003 bolivia in 2005 2006 and ecuador in 2006 2007 due to the destruction of anastasio somoza s army and the flight of the dictator the fsln not only assumed governmental power which the other cases cited did via the electoral process it also replaced the somocista army with a new army that was put at the service of the people took over total control of the banks and decreed a public monopoly on foreign trade weapons were distributed to the population for their self defense due to risks of outside aggression and an attempted coup coming from the right these are fundamental changes that did not take place in the aforementioned countries they did take place in cuba between 1959 and 1961 and were extended during the 1960s in the 1980s major social progress was made in nicaragua in the areas of health care education improving housing conditions even if they remained rudimentary fuller rights to organization and protest access to credit for small producers thanks to nationalization of the banking system and more these represented undeniable progress however throughout the 1980s the fsln government had to fight a decade long war against the counter revolutionary forces known as the contras heavily supported by the united states which could never satisfy its ambition of direct military intervention to topple the sandinistas but settled for a low intensity conflict which would strangle nicaragua economically and isolate the fsln politically us imperialism and its vassals such as the regime of carlos andrès perez in venezuela or dictatorships as in honduras found it necessary to contain the spreading of this extraordinary experiment in social liberation and renewal of national dignity in fact social revolt was rampant in the region in particular in salvador and guatemala where revolutionary forces close to the sandinistas had been active for decades in 1990 the fsln lost the general election to the right with violeta chamorro the widow of pedro joaquã n chamorro cardenal being elected president under chamorro nicaragua was to fully embrace the neoliberal austerity promoted by the washington consensus which was to result by the end of the decade in nicaragua becoming the second poorest country in the americas after haiti change society without taking power in the 1990s as a result of disappointed hopes there were those who were saying that what is needed is to try to change society without taking power one aspect of their approach was quite pertinent it is absolutely vital to promote processes of change that take place at the base of society and which presuppose self organization by citizens freedom of expression and freedom to demonstrate and organize but the idea that power must not be taken is not valid because it is not possible to really change society unless the people take power at the level of the state the question is rather how to build an authentic democracy in the original sense of the word that is power exercised directly by the people for the purpose of emancipation in other words power of the people by the people and for the people we feel that it was necessary to overthrow the somoza dictatorship through the combined action of a popular uprising and the intervention of a political military organization and as such the victory of july 1979 remains a popular triumph worthy of celebration it must be stressed that without the ingenuity and tenacity of the people during the struggle the fsln would not have succeeded in striking the decisive blow against the somoza dictatorship the fsln leadership did not go far enough in radicalization for the benefit of the people several questions arise did the fsln go too far in the changes it made in the society did it take the wrong direction or are the disappointing subsequent developments the result of aggression by north american imperialism and its allies in nicaragua and elsewhere in the region here we will highlight errors made in two main areas first the fsln leadership did not go far enough in taking radical measures in favor of the segments of the population who were most exploited and oppressed beginning with the poor rural population but also factory workers and health care and education workers who were generally underpaid it made too many concessions to agrarian and urban capitalists second the leadership of the fsln with its slogan national directorate give us your orders did not provide sufficient support for self organization and worker control it placed limits that were highly detrimental to the revolutionary process of course responsibility for the outbreak of the war lies exclusively with the enemies of the sandinista government the latter of which had no choice but to confront the aggression nevertheless errors were made in the means of waging the war humberto ortega the head of the army formed a regular army equipped with expensive heavy tanks unsuitable against the guerrilla methods of the contras and the conscription of the country s youth in order to reinforce the army was also badly perceived by the population this combined with the errors made in the area of agrarian reform had damaging consequences in a recent interview henry ruiz one of the nine members of the national leadership in the 1980s underlines the fact in these terms the campesinos were not favored on the contrary they were affected by the war the war waged by the contra and the war waged by us errors made by the sandinista leadership what errors were made here is a summary presentation of a question that deserves long discussion the agrarian question was not dealt with properly agrarian reform was seriously insufficient and the contras took full advantage of that fact much more land should have been distributed to rural families giving them title to the property because expectations were enormous among a large part of the population who needed land and were struggling to have the arable land in the large private estates including but not only those belonging to the somoza clan distributed to those who wanted to work it the orientation that won out among the sandinista leadership was to target the major somoza estates but to spare the interests of major capitalist groups and powerful families whom certain sandinista leaders wanted to turn into allies or fellow travelers another error was made the fsln wanted to quickly create a state agrarian sector and cooperatives to replace the large somocista estates which was not in line with the attitudes of the rural population priority should have been given to small and medium private farms distributing titles to the property and providing material and technical aid to the new campesino owners priority also should have been given to support for production for the domestic market which was already substantial but could have been improved and increased and the regional market making maximum use of organic agriculture methods to sum up the leadership of the fsln combined two serious errors on the one hand it made too many concessions to the bourgeois who were considered allies in the change then in progress and on the other hand it engaged in excessive statism or artificial cooperativism the result was not long in coming a part of the population disappointed by the decisions of the sandinista government was attracted by the contra the latter had the intelligence to adopt a discourse that was aimed at the disillusioned campesinos telling them that they would help them overthrow the fsln resulting in a truly fair distribution of land and true agrarian reform this was deceitful propaganda but it was widely disseminated that is corroborated by a series of studies in the field which éric toussaint one of the authors of this article had access to from 1986 1987 after several trips made to nicaragua to provide internationalist solidarity in particular studies led in rural regions where the contra had gained popular support certain entities within the sandinista movement itself conducted very serious surveys on the ground and alerted the sandinista leadership about what was happening these included the work coordinated by orlando nuã ez whose later political evolution led him to remain loyal to ortega despite his initial left wing sandinista stance work done by other entities independent of the government and related to liberation theology came to the same conclusions a number of rural organizations linked to sandinism unag atc etc were also aware of the problems but engaged in self censorship and internationalist experts specialized in the rural world also sounded the alarm concerning self organization and worker control the fsln inherited the cuban tradition which promotes popular organization but within a very controlled and limited framework cuba which at the start of the 1960s had experienced a broad movement toward self organization gradually moved towards a model in which there is much greater control from above starting with the increase in soviet influence in the late 1960s 1970s and part of the fsln leadership was trained in cuba at that time the decade after 1970 has been defined as the grey period by an entire generation of cuban marxists in short the sandinista leadership inherited a tradition that was strongly influenced by the bureaucratic degeneration of the soviet union and its destructive impact on a large part of the left internationally including in cuba similarly the application starting in 1988 of a structural adjustment program that strongly resembled the programs dictated to other countries by the imf and the world bank is another error made by the sandinista government regarding this question sandinista members have made their criticism of the orientation that was taken by their leadership very clear they expressed their point of view both internally and publicly but unfortunately no correction of the errors ensued the government extended a policy that was leading the process straight into a wall and would result in popular rejection at the polls and a victory of the right in the election of february 1990 it was not overly radical policies that weakened the sandinista revolution what prevented it from advancing sufficiently with the support of a majority of the population was its failure to put the people at the core of the transition that followed the overthrow of the somoza dictatorship in short the government maintained an economic orientation that was compatible with the interests of nicaragua s wealthy bourgeoisie and major private foreign corporations that is an economy oriented toward exportation and based on low wages in order to remain competitive on the worldwide market this was not doomed to happen alternative policies could have been implemented the government should have paid more attention to the needs and aspirations of the people in rural as well as urban areas it should have redistributed land for the benefit of the campesinos developing and or strengthening small landholding and to the extent possible forms of voluntary cooperatives the government should have promoted wage increases for workers both in the private and public sectors if the sandinistas had really wanted to break away from the export oriented extractivist model that depends on competitiveness on the international market they should have gone against the interests of the capitalists that still dominated the export oriented extractivist industry they should have done more to gradually implement policies in favor of the small and medium sized producers who supplied the domestic market such as protectionist measures in order to limit importations this would have allowed the peasants and small and medium enterprises not to have to make sacrifices for the sake of competitiveness on the international market instead of encouraging the masses to follow orders given from the top of the fsln self organization by citizens should have been promoted at all levels and citizens should have been given control over the public administration as well as over the accounts of private companies the political institutions that were installed by the fsln did not fundamentally differ from the ones of a parliamentary democracy with a strong presidential role something which would impede the capacity of the masses to constitute a counter power when the right would be elected in 1990 concessions were made to local big capital which was wrongly perceived as being patriotic and an ally of the people the increases in wages were limited fiscal incentives in the form of lower taxation were given to the bosses any such alliance should have been rejected at each important stage criticism from within the fsln emerged the magazine envio for instance was founded in 1981 as a publication that provided â critical support to nicaragua s revolutionary process from the perspective of liberation theology s option for the poor but such criticism was not actually taken into account by the leadership which was more and more dominated by daniel ortega his brother humberto and vã ctor tirado lópez all three of whom supported the tercerista faction which as was explained above did not have a full understanding of the necessity of self organization and was inclined to alliances with the bourgeoisie and were joined by tomas borge and bayardo arce of the prolonged people s war faction further the four other members of the national leadership did not form a bloc to oppose the continuation and deepening of the errors that were made it is very important to point out that proposals for alternative policies were formulated both inside the fsln and from outside from political groups who wanted to further the revolutionary process that was underway constructive critical voices did not wait for the electoral failure of february 1990 to propose new directions but they received only a limited hearing and remained relatively isolated illegitimate and odious debt the leadership of the fsln should also have questioned repayment of the public debt inherited from the somoza dictatorship and should have broken with the world bank and the imf as a dependent country aligned on the united states somoza s nicaragua had been a receiver of booming foreign lending in the 1970s by multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the imf as well as by international private banks while the loans were officially intended for development they benefitted the strengthening of an authoritarian regime and the increase in wealth of somoza and his clique after the latter left the country with most of their assets the new sandinista rulers of nicaragua were in dire need of funding in order to implement progressive policies and to encourage the industrialization of the country somoza s debt would soon be a burden and impede the implementation of such policies when the fsln took power the foreign debt stood at 1 5 billion and in 1981 its servicing represented 28 of the country s exportations revenue the sandinistas should have conducted an audit of the debt with broad citizen participation this is a fundamental point the sandinista government s agreeing to continue repaying the debt was in keeping with its defense of the interests of a part of nicaragua s bourgeoisie who had invested in the debt issued by somoza and borrowed money from us banks for the sandinista government this was also a way of avoiding a confrontation with the world bank and the imf despite the fact that they had financed the dictatorship despite the government s efforts to maintain collaboration with the two institutions the latter decided to suspend financial relations with the new nicaraguan authorities this shows that it was useless to make concessions to them admittedly it was not easy for the government of a country like nicaragua to face its creditors alone but it could have begun by questioning the legitimacy of the debts claimed by the world bank the imf and the states and private banks that had financed the dictatorship the government could have launched an audit of these debts by calling for citizen participation and could have gained support for a demand for abolition of those debts by the broad international movement in support of the nicaraguan people instead in 1988 after the external debt had reached 7 billion the government went as far as implementing a structural adjustment plan that degraded the conditions of the poor without affecting the rich very much resembling the usual conditions imposed by the imf and world bank while these institutions had still not resumed their financial relations with nicaragua it can never be repeated often enough that a refusal to stand up to creditors who demand repayment of an illegitimate debt is generally the beginning of the abandonment of the program of change if the burden of illegitimate debt is not denounced the people are condemned to bear that burden in 1979 two months after the overthrow of somoza fidel castro said in a speech before the general assembly of the united nations the developing countries debt has already reached 335 billion it is estimated that the total payment for servicing the foreign debt amounts to more than 40 billion each year with represents more than 20 percent of their annual exports furthermore the average per capita income in the developed countries is now 14 times greater than that of the underdeveloped countries this situation is already unbearable at the continental dialogue on the foreign debt held at havana s palace of conventions on august 3rd 1985 he said the debts of the countries with less relative development in a disadvantaged situation are unbearable and do not have a solution and they should be cancelled as part of a major international campaign for the abolition of illegitimate debt castro made a series of arguments at that conference that are quite applicable to nicaragua s case to all these moral political and economic reasons we can add many legal reasons who signed the contracts who is sovereign on the basis of what concept can it be said that the people committed themselves to paying and that they signed for the credits and received the credits most of those credits were secured by repressive military dictatorships that did not consult the people do the debts and the commitments of the peoples oppressors have to be paid by the oppressed this is the moral and philosophical basis of this idea the parliaments were not consulted the principle of sovereignty was violated what parliament participated in this debt signing process and knew about it we stress the issue of illegitimate debt because should the oppressive regime of daniel ortega and rosario murillo be overthrown it would be essential for a popular government to call repayment of the debt demanded of nicaragua into question should the right take leadership of the overthrow of the regime we can be certain that it will not call the debt repayment demanded of nicaragua into question after the defeat in the election of february 1990 daniel ortega extended a policy of class collaboration in 1989 the fsln government reached an agreement with the contras that put an end to fighting which was of course a positive development it was presented as the victorious outcome of the strategy that had been adopted yet it was a pyrrhic victory the sandinista leadership called a general election in february 1990 and felt certain it would win election results struck the sandinista leadership with an amazed wave of panic the right had won partly by threatening that fighting would resume if the fsln won many people wanted to avoid further bloodshed and thus reluctantly voted for the right hoping for an end to war for good some were also disappointed by the fsln government s policies in the countryside deficient agrarian reform and in cities negative consequences of the austerity measures enforced by the structural adjustment program begun in 1988 though sandinista organizations could still rely on a lot of support among young people workers and civil servants as well as among a significant number of farm laborers the sandinista leadership expected to reap 70 of the votes in the elections so it was flabbergasted as it hadn t perceived the growing discontent in a large portion of the population this illustrates the gap between the majority of the people and a leadership that had become used to giving orders after the defeat in the election of february 1990 daniel ortega adopted an attitude that swung back and forth between compromise with the government and confrontation the sandinista leadership with daniel and humberto ortega at its head negotiated the transition with violeta chamorro s new government humberto was still general in chief of a starkly reduced army the most left wing members of the army had been dismissed under the pretext that they had supplied missiles to the farabundo martã national liberation front fmln which was still attempting to bring about a general uprising in salvador in the context of presidents gorbachev and bush coming closer together soviet authorities had denounced the fact that sam 7 and sam 14 missiles that had been supplied by the ussr to the sandinistas had been passed on to the fmln and used to shoot down us army helicopters operating in el salvador four sandinista officers were imprisoned on an order from humberto ortega with the following explanation blinded by their political passion and guided by extremist arguments this small group of officers flouted military honor and the institution s and military command s loyalty which is the same as flouting the sacred patriotic and revolutionary interests of nicaragua this led to strong criticism from the workers national front which included sandinista trade union organizations from the sandinista youth as well as from a number of fsln activists moreover a left wing group of former members of the prolonged people s war faction that published the bulletin nicaragua desde adentro disapproved of humberto ortega s decision to remain head of the army under a right wing presidency instead of leaving his position to his deputy who was also a member of the fsln so that humberto ortega could remain in the fsln leadership and join the political opposition to the new regime a few months after violeta chamorro started her mandate as president a massive movement spread throughout the country in july 1990 protesting massive layoffs planned in the public services as well as other issues linked with the implementation of a market oriented economic policy managua and other cities were covered with sandinista barricades and the trade unions launched a general strike this resulted in a compromise with violeta chamorro s government which was forced to withdraw some measures but the sandinista grassroots was disgruntled at the fsln leadership having halted protest actions later the front s leadership gradually made concessions to chamorro accepting the dismantling of the public banking sector the reduction of the public sector in both agriculture and manufacturing the end of the state s monopoly on foreign trade chamorro also organized the cleansing of the police force and incorporated former contras into it it must be said that after the victory of the right a significant part of the estates formerly expropriated from the somocistas after the 1979 victory were appropriated by a few sandinista leaders who consequently accessed to the role of capitalists this process was called piã ata those who organized it accounted for it as meeting the need to secure assets for the fsln against a government that might want to confiscate the party s assets despite a radicalization of some elements of the fsln throughout 1990 and 1991 others such as former sandinista minister alejandro martinez cuenca openly mentioned the need for a co gobierno a kind of conditional external support to violeta chamorro s government and supported the policy enforced by the international monetary fund which to some extent could be perceived as in line with the policy followed by the sandinista government from 1988 éric toussaint was a first hand eyewitness to such class collaborationist policies advocated for by daniel ortega and other flsn leaders in 1992 as a participant in the 3rd forum of sã o paulo in managua in 1992 éric toussaint accompanied ernest mandel a leader of the fourth international who had been invited to deliver the inaugural speech at the 3rd forum of sã o paulo the forum launched in 1990 by brazil s workers party in portuguese partido dos trabalhadores pt under lula da silva s leadership brought together a broad spectrum of the latin american left from the cuban cp to the frente amplio of uruguay and including guerrilla organizations like the fmln in el salvador ernest mandel entitled his speech socialism and the future beginning with an observation of the great difficulties facing the forces of the radical left worldwide he stated that priority had to be given to emphasizing demands aimed at attaining fundamental human rights while at the same time maintaining the perspective of socialism in his conclusion he stressed that this socialism must be self managing feminist ecological radical pacifist pluralistic it must qualitatively extend democracy and be internationalist and pluralist including in terms of multiparty system the emancipation of the workers will be the work of the workers themselves it cannot be done by states governments parties supposedly infallible leaders or experts of any kind during the forum vã ctor tirado lópez one of the commandants who were closest to daniel ortega at that time asked to have a private meeting with ernest mandel who asked éric toussaint to accompany him vã ctor tirado lópez began by saying that he had much admiration for ernest mandel s work and in particular his marxist economic theory then the commandant exposed his analysis of the international situation according to him the capitalist system had reached maturity and would undergo no further crises and would lead to socialism without the need for further revolutions this was totally absurd and ernest mandel said so very clearly and with emotion when mandel then responded that crises would indeed continue and that in certain parts of latin america such as brazil s northeast living conditions were clearly worsening for the most exploited populations tirado lópez answered that those regions had not yet been reached by the civilization that had been brought by christopher columbus five centuries earlier ernest mandel and éric toussaint then put an abrupt end to this preposterous conversation the following day daniel ortega expressed the desire to meet in private with mandel to present the proposed alternative program he wanted to defend publicly as the fsln against the rightist government of violeta chamorro after reading it we realized that the program did not meet the minimum conditions for constituting an alternative to put it simply it was compatible with the reforms undertaken by the rightist government and would not enable the offensive against the right to be resumed mandel said so very clearly to daniel ortega who was not at all pleased these two discussions show how profoundly certain fsln leaders had gone astray the subsequent evolution of daniel ortega and those who accompanied him on his path back to power was already clearly perceptible in the early 1990s daniel ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln a large part of the sandinista militants from the revolutionary period rejected that orientation in the years that followed it took time and daniel ortega took advantage of the slow dawning of awareness of the danger to consolidate his influence within the fsln and marginalize or exclude those who defended a different orientation simultaneously daniel ortega succeeded in maintaining privileged relations with a number of leaders of popular sandinista organizations who felt that in the absence of anyone else he was the leader most likely to defend the series of gains made during the 1980s that explains in part why in 2018 the ortega regime still has the support of part of the population and the popular movement despite its use of extremely brutal methods of repression ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln in the 1990s is best summed up by mónica baltodano former guerilla commander see picture above former member of the fsln leadership and now a member of the movement for the rescue of sandinismo in spanish movimiento por el rescate del sandinismo mprs the dispute within the fsln between 1993 and 1995 persuaded ortega and his iron circle of the importance of controlling the party apparatus that became more concretized precisely in the fsln s 1998 congress in which what remained of the national directorate i e the sandinista assembly and the fsln congress itself were replaced with an assembly whose participants were mainly the leaders of the grassroots organizations loyal to ortega little by little even that assembly stopped meeting at that point an important rupture occurred by then it was already evident that ortega was increasingly distancing himself from leftist positions and centering his strategy on how to expand his power his emphasis was power for power s sake mónica baltodano goes on to explain the building of alliances that ultimately led to daniel ortega s coming back to the presidential office an alliance building process started then to increase his power the first was with president arnoldo alemán which produced the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 ortega s central aims in that alliance were to reduce the percentage needed to win the presidential elections on the first round divvy up between their two parties the top posts in all state institutions and guarantee security to the fsln leaders personal properties and businesses in exchange he guaranteed alemán governability by putting a stop to strikes and other struggles for grassroots demands the fsln stopped opposing the neoliberal policies in the following years the main leaders of the party s once mass organizations became national assembly representatives or were brought into the structures of ortega s circle of power with that they obviously stopped resisting and struggling for all the things they had once believed in those years also saw the forming of ties â i wouldn t call it an allianceâ with the head of the catholic church cardinal obando the main purpose of that linkage was control of the electoral branch of government through obando s personal intimate relation with roberto rivas who had been heading the electoral branch since 2000 it also bought ortega increased influence with both the catholic faithful and the church hierarchy after alemán was charged with corruption and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment the agreement he had concluded with ortega proved to be profitable ortega saw to it that the men he had placed in the judicial system arranged preferential treatment for alemán allowing him to serve out his sentence in house arrest later in 2009 two years after his election as president of nicaragua daniel ortega gave his support to the supreme court s decision to quash alemán s conviction and release him a few days later alemán returned the favor by ensuring that the parliamentary group of the liberal party he led voted for the election of a sandinista at the head of the national assembly the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 reduced the percentage needed to win the presidential election on the first round to 35 of the votes if the candidate has a 5 margin over the candidate coming in second ortega was elected with 38 07 of the votes in november 2006 and took office in january 2007 he was re elected in november 2011 and in november 2016 after what rosario murillo whom he had married in the church with cardinal obando as officiant and who had been spokesperson of the government since 2007 became vice president the revolution betrayed since 2007 the policies which have been implemented by ortega and murillo have looked more like a continuation of the policies pursued by the three right wing governments that succeeded one another between 1990 and 2007 than like a continuation of the sandinista experience from 1979 1990 in this respect the article by mónica baltodano published in january 2014 and quoted above deserves a full reading in the last eleven years daniel ortega s government did not carry out any structural reform no socialization of the banks no new agrarian reform despite the very important concentration of land in the hands of big landowners no urban reform in favor of the toiling classes no tax reform in favor of more social justice free trade zone regimes have been expanded the contracting of internal and external debt has been pursued under the same conditions that favor the creditors through the interest payments they receive and that allow them to impose policies in their favor through blackmail in 2006 the sandinista parliamentary group voted hand in hand with the right wing mps in favor of a law totally prohibiting abortion it was under the presidency of daniel ortega who refused to call the measure into question that the prohibition was included in the new criminal code that entered into force in july 2008 there are no exceptions whatsoever to the prohibition including cases of danger to the health or the life of the pregnant woman or pregnancy resulting from rape this retrograde legislation was accompanied by serious attacks on organizations defending women s rights who have been among the most active in the opposition to the ortega government in another very troubling development references to the catholic religion have been systematically used by the regime in particular by rosario murillo who has made a point of denouncing women s rights organizations and the support they receive from abroad in their struggle for the right to abortion as being the devil s work nicaragua can still be characterized by its very low wages pronicaragua the official agency promoting foreign investment in the country brags about he minimum wage the most competitive at the regional level which makes nicaragua an ideal country to set up labor intensive operations over the recent years labor insecurity starkly increased informal economy represented 60 of the total employment in 2009 a figure which stood at 80 in 2017 no progress was made towards a diminution of social inequalities and the number of millionaires increased the growth in wealth produced was not distributed to the toiling classes but benefitted the big national and international capital with the help of daniel ortega s government furthermore the latter and his family also became richer the main trigger of the social protests that started in april 2018 was the announcement by ortega s government of neoliberal measures to be taken concerning social security in particular a pension reform these measures were advocated for by the imf with which ortega had maintained excellent relations since he took office in 2007 in a statement published in february 2018 the imf congratulated the government for its achievements economic performance in 2017 was above expectations and the 2018 outlook is favorable staff recommends that the inss reform plan secures its long term viability and corrects the inequities within the system staff welcomes the authorities efforts to alleviate inss financing needs the most unpopular measures were a 5 decrease of the pensions meant to finance medical expenses and a limitation of the annual indexation of these pensions over the inflation rate future pension benefits for the close to one million workers affiliated to the pension system were meant to be based on a less favorable calculation which would have resulted in cuts in pension benefits that could have been as high as 13 these measures sparked a mass protest movement at first mainly composed of students and young people the movement quickly joined with other protests in particular with the mainly peasant and indigenous based movement against the construction of a transoceanic canal meant as an alternative to the panama canal that would endanger large parts of the environment and livelihoods eventually ortega gave up on these reforms this was not before he had initiated a criminal spiral of repression which resulted in more than 300 protesters being killed by security forces and pro regime militiamen now joined by parts of the population horrified by the government s repressive response the protests radicalized eventually demanding the fall of the regime the government accused the protesters of being right wing golpistas and terrorists working towards regime change with the support of us imperialism the government was however unable to provide any non fabricated evidence to support such claims in fact the united states which has little to say about ortega s neoliberal economic policies took rather timid sanctions in reaction to the repression so far similarly the examination by the us senate of the nicaraguan investment conditionality act nica of 2017 which deserves to be denounced as an imperialist policy impinging on nicaragua s national sovereignty was not sped up by recent events furthermore ortega and murillo strengthened their use of religious fundamentalist references and denounced the protesters as having satanic rituals and practices as opposed to the rest of the nicaraguan people because the nicaraguan people are god s people on 19 july 2018 during the rally organized on the anniversary of the sandinista revolution to try and strengthen his legitimacy ortega repeated these absurd claims and called on the catholic bishops to exorcize the protesters and chase out the devil which supposedly had taken possession of them by the middle of july the policy of terror led by the government allowed the latter to regain control of the streets since then massive arrests have taken place and several hundreds of people labelled as terrorists by the government are still imprisoned human rights associations are not permitted to enter the prisons nor are the lawyers of some of the detainees some of them were tortured and forced to give false confessions supporting the claim according to which the regime faces a foreign led plot aimed at removing it by force by means of conclusion the sandinista revolution started as an extraordinary experience of social liberation and renewal of national dignity in a dependent country whose status as a backyard for us imperialism had been accepted by its authoritarian dynastic rulers for decades the achievements of the sandinista government between 1979 and 1990 however did not go far enough while they allowed for significant improvements of the living conditions of most of the nicaraguans they did not break with the export oriented extractivist model which was dominated by the big capital nor did they significantly promote the active participation of the masses in the economic and political decision making processes the political institutions and the internal organization of the fsln were not developed as tools that could have empowered the masses an error which allowed for the fsln degeneration during ortega s road back to power this understanding of the nicaraguan revolution and its degeneration stresses the need for revolutionaries and socialist activists to encourage the broadest possible participation of the masses in the fight for their emancipation as well as to help ensure their self organization a corollary to this idea is the need for revolutionaries to struggle against the bureaucratization of their organizations leadership which begins with building organizations that respect internal democracy this was strongly underestimated by the fsln which remained a political military organization after it had seized power and waited until 1991 before it organized its first congress as a political organization while the sandinista leadership made the right choice when it recognized the victory of the right in 1990 the subsequent steps taken by the fsln leadership under daniel ortega were clearly meant for him to come back to power for power s sake the left wing of the fsln which organized as critical currents during the 1990s was too timid in its opposition to these moves finally the international left needs to have a materialist analysis of social and political processes and shall not cling to fantasized ideas of experiences of really existing socialism the evolution of the fsln and the policies led in nicaragua since 2007 should be analyzed for what they are rather than on the basis of what daniel ortega and rosario murillo presumably stood for as fsln activists during the 1970s and 1980s in this sense ortega and murillo s deepening of the neoliberal policies pursued by their right wing predecessors as well as their total ban of abortion should be denounced by the international left furthermore the left should strongly denounce the criminal repression currently organized by the regime against protesters and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners when adopting such a stance the left should in no way compromise itself by supporting a right wing pro imperialist opposition on the contrary this stance should be accompanied by an effort to link with and reinforce the critical sandinistas and other members of the progressive opposition to ortega and murillo in particular the youth who mobilized strongly since april 2018 the feminist movement and the peasant and indigenous movement who opposed the project of transoceanic canal and other destructive projects linked with the export led capitalist model éric toussaint made frequent visits to nicaragua and the rest of central america between 1984 and 1992 he took part in the organization of the voluntary work brigades with trade unionists and other militants of international solidarity that went out from belgium to nicaragua between 1985 and 1989 he was one of the fgtb general federation of belgian labour activists on nicaraguan issues he met with various members of the sandinista directorate tomas borge henry ruiz luis carrion victor tirado lopez in the period from 1984

july 1992 at the international institute for research and education in amsterdam he taught courses in the 1980s on the fsln s revolutionary strategy before they came to power and in the post 1979

in november russian finance minister anton siluanov said that moscow and beijing were finalising a memorandum to settle more bilateral trade in the rouble and yuan russia china and a number of other countries are aiming to cut their dependence on the us dollar as washington uses access to the dollar payment system as a weapon to punish nations and individuals for breaking us laws even outside the united states russia and china plan to ditch the us dollar and switch to local currencies in international trade but yet another delay to a new system for yuan rouble settlements shows just how complex it is to develop an alternative to the greenback the two countries were also reportedly in talks to launch a new cross border system to improve direct payments of trade invoices and for the use of china s unionpay credit card in russia and russia s mir card in china but late last month russian media quoted siluanov as saying that moscow had decided to step away from beijing s proposed plan talks would continue between the two countries central banks as well as between russia s ministry of finance and china s ministry of commerce the reports said without offering details of the plan given the growth in russia china trade and their opposition to us sanctions via the dollar payment system beijing and moscow were likely to keep working towards a system acceptable to both sides analysts said like a growing number of countries china and russia are keen to work out an alternative to protect their banks and bankrollers from the us secondary sanction power of prosecuting entities that deal with sanctioned companies or individuals from russia iran or venezuela but other nations such as india aim to enter a bilateral arrangement to cut their ballooning trade deficit with china it s no easy task though just before the deal with moscow was put on hold beijing rejected an indian proposal for a rupee yuan transaction system the us dollar is the preferred currency for international trade because it is one of the least volatile and thus less prone to a sudden depreciation photo reuters the setback for the new payments infrastructure shows just how difficult it is to shift away from the us dominated status quo dmitry dolgin russia chief economist at ing bank said that the memorandum between china and russia was supposed to improve financial infrastructure for settlements in those currencies the shelving of the agreement means the clearing will not become easier any time soon dolgin said the us dollar is the preferred currency for international trade because it is one of the least volatile and thus less prone to a sudden depreciation russia s rouble is a more volatile currency partly due to existing us and european sanctions and partly because its main export is energy which leaves the rouble vulnerable to changes in petroleum prices evghenia sleptsova senior emerging market economist at oxford economics said that the greater stability of the yuan over the rouble was a plus for russian exporters and a minus for chinese exporters who had no incentive to add currency risks to an already volatile commodity and while china s belt and road initiative and the eurasian economic union are forging economic ties between the two countries china is fast replacing russia as a dominant economic power in the region which might make russia reluctant to accept chinese financing and projects according to otilia dhand senior vice president at the intelligence division of teneo a management consultancy russia and china are developing cooperation in several areas and these intensifying collaboration is partially driven by their shared opposition to the us dominance in the world dhand said but the economic gains were modest with some chinese investment falling through in even the most promising areas such as the energy sector she said china has also slowed down its efforts to internationalise its currency in the last three years because of concerns about capital outflows amid slowing economic growth beijing is strictly scrutinising and controlling outbound investments by chinese individuals and businesses even though it encourages foreign investors to plough money into the country still the role of the yuan and the rouble in russia s financial and trade transactions has grown in the last few years and the strategic partnership with china will continue to deepen especially if the us remains in an adversarial position to both according to dolgin that growth has been aided by china setting up a payment versus payment pvp system for yuan rouble transactions in 2017 paving the way for china to use pvp systems for yuan transactions with other currencies along the belt and road route the pvp systems reduce settlement risk as well as the risk of transactions taking place in different time zones and improve foreign exchange market efficiency in 2014 china and russia signed 38 energy trade and finance deals and a currency swap worth 150 billion yuan us 22 billion russia had sought trade links with china after its forceful annexation of crimea soured ties with the united states and european union in bilateral trade with china about 14 per cent of payments are already done in yuan and about 7 to 8 per cent in the rouble according to russia s finance ministry the russian central bank is also buying yuan for its foreign reserves purchasing us 44 billion worth of the chinese currency in the second quarter of 2018 while selling more than us 100 billion of us dollars russia held us 67 billion in yuan as of mid 2018 15 per cent of its international reserves china s yuan has become the fourth largest component of russia s international reserves after the euro 32 per cent the us dollar 22 per

today s world news from africa asia u s europe and middle east letter from africa despair anger and anxiety in zimbabwe s fuel queues bbc com international jan 15 2019 11 52 in our series of letters from african writers the journalist and lawyer brian hungwe reflects on the impact of inflation on the lives of zimbabweans where the price of fuel has more than doubled in an effort to deal with a shortage i joined a queue for petrol at around 16 00 on saturday afternoon dozens of cars made an orderly line stretching about 500m the pace of the service was so excruciatingly slow that most of us made friends in an effort to keep boredom at bay anger over price rise by the time i got to within 100m to the petrol pump about five cars ahead of me it was an hour before midnight but the fuel attendants suddenly shut the pumps packed up their bags and left you can imagine the murmurs of despair anger and anxiety news had filtered in that president emmerson mnangagwa had put up the price of fuel by more than 100 to take effect at midnight those lucky enough to have bought their fuel before us could only thank the heavens the reason for the hike the government said was to avert fuel shortages that have created national angst the hike means petrol prices rose from 1 24 0 97 a litre to 3 31 with diesel up from 1 36 a litre to 3 11 zimbabweans were not pleased by these changes hundreds of them went to the streets of the capital harare and the southern city of bulawayo to protest against the new prices the sudden increase is symptomatic of price distortions zimbabweans have to deal with on a daily basis the price of fuel is fixed by the authorities unlike other businesses fuel stations have to sell petrol at the same price in us dollars and the surrogate currency bond notes introduced more than two years ago to address a cash crisis thriving black market the government maintains that bond notes which is only traded in zimbabwe is pegged to the us dollar but the reality of the ground is different there is a thriving black market where three bond notes fetch one us dollar the current situation reminds everyone of the pre 2009 era when inflation went into the stratosphere reaching 231m in six months before the zimbabwe dollar was abandoned for international currencies like the us dollar and the south african rand you have to walk into a supermarket to see the price distortions at work if i pick groceries worth 20 i will be given a choice of how to pay for the items i could opt to use bond notes but the bill will be 60 bond notes or i could pay electronically with my card and 70 bond notes would be deducted from my account as each electronic transaction is now subject to tax doctors and other civil servants whose salaries are paid in bond notes are angry and some even went on strike to demand that they get paid in dollars as their salaries cannot keep up with the inflation there are many businesses which are only accepting payment in us dollars including private schools if doctors were to get their wish they would have to open up a separate foreign exchange account this is because ordinary bank accounts no longer handle us dollars three years back one could withdraw as much as 2 500 from a cash machine now they only supply bond notes and each account holder can only withdraw 20 bond notes a day queues outside banks are therefore a common sight as zimbabweans use other ingenious ways to get access to their money the government also tries as much as it can to get its hand on foreign currency expatriates and tourists for example are required to pay for goods and services using us dollars other lucky zimbabweans get money sent by relatives overseas to help them navigate the economic challenges consequently zimbabweans have not taken to the bond notes the currency is being blamed for the inflation crisis and the price distortions that have become a headache for consumers and industry alike but these distortions were predictable if you talk to economists they will tell you something about gresham s law which occurs when two different currencies are given the same value cash under the mattress the principal is bad money drives out good in other words one currency will become more desired than the other in the case of zimbabwe and the us dollar the desired currency disappeared as many withdrew their us dollar cash from the bank and kept the notes under their mattresses most banks ran out of it worsening a biting cash crisis just after the military intervention that ousted president robert mugabe in november 2017 zimbabweans were obsessed by debates around economic reforms suddenly everyone became an economist but the investment has not come flooding in as was expected investors may still be spooked by the nature of the military s hand in the government the euphoria that ushered in president emmerson mnangagwa or ed as he is affectionately known has ebbed and he is now walking a tightrope finance minister mthuli ncube says he wants to reintroduce the zimbabwean dollar by the end of this year experts say this would allow the central bank to control inflation more effectively and it will be good for the economy the current dollarised scenario where we are having to import foreign currency for local use is unsustainable as current foreign exchange generation is not enough to meet the country s import demands economic analyst persistence gwanyanya told the state run herald newspaper but frustration is growing daily with many zimbabweans fed up that the post robert mugabe era is not living up to the high expectations

in recent decades gulf arab states have sought new international business partners most crucially by fostering lucrative banking infrastructure and investment ties with china how can scholars understand the origins of china s engagement with the gulf region how have gulf cooperation council gcc member states including the united arab emirates saudi arabia and kuwait understood and managed the growth of chinese economic activity within gulf markets china s emergence as a key commercial and trading partner for the gulf arab states is a relatively new development and has been expressed through several key post cold war economic trends crucially the opening of diplomatic relations between gulf arab states china and russia after 1989 1991 provided the spark for this process of economic rapprochement regionally ties between china and arab states particularly saudi arabia and the uae grew within the bounds of this broad global trend toward greater international exchange with communist bloc states since 1990 the rapid opening of the chinese market to foreign investors and exports most importantly within the energy sector has transformed the sino gulf economic relationship particularly in terms of natural resource flows today gulf oil and gas has increasingly moves less to the west and more to the east this trend accelerated rapidly during the 2000 2014 period in which oil prices remained steadily high generating significant wealth for gulf arab states and cementing china alongside several other asian states like south korea and japan as the top consumers of gulf oil meanwhile qatar s relationship with china as a natural gas provider followed much the same trajectory although its ties developed more recently than did those of its neighbors in saudi arabia or the uae from the chinese perspective beijing s activities in the middle east have revolved around the exigencies of the belt and road initiative bri announced in 2013 although in the case of the arabian peninsula and gulf region china s approach may be better described as linking together a string of pearls china appears primarily focused on building logistics hubs and boosting its ability to use existing port facilities within the region to support economic and hard power projection it is perhaps easy to assume especially if one does not study chinese politics closely that beijing s efforts in the middle east represent a powerful state led project that its infrastructure development commercial and diplomatic activities are governed by some central entity within the chinese communist party however this depiction does not capture the realities of china s activities in the arabian peninsula or the history of chinese presence in the gulf region china s entrance into the gulf region originated with the first chinese investors who settled in dubai in the late 1980s and early 1990s where they started essentially what became a chinatown in bur dubai yuting wang a professor of sociology at the american university of sharjah in the uae is currently undertaking an ethnographic study of these first chinese investors in dubai her research has indicated that these individuals were not emigrating as part of any state directed initiative from beijing instead they were private chinese entrepreneurs who hailed from very specific regions primarily western china s muslim dominant areas and brought with them equally specific industries the chinese community that first came to dubai for example was known for glassmaking and these emigres established manufacturing activity that built on this background this immigrant story in the gulf formed the foundation for subsequent chinese engagement with arab states there fascinatingly the chinese government and planners of the bri today rely on the immigrant community linkages which pre date the flourishing of china gulf economic ties to build investment opportunities and diplomatic initiatives this linking of organic diaspora communities to current economic objectives has been particularly successful in the uae this history provides important context for understanding the competition between economic models chinese and gulf arab that inform visions of development for the wider middle east and north africa region as well as the horn of africa much of the capacity that gulf arab states have developed over the past decade for example expertise in port operations or power plant construction closely match current chinese capabilities beijing has thus made inroads into the gulf initially through the establishment of chinese bank branches in the dubai financial center the chinese government through these banks subsequently started to bid on large infrastructure projects in the gulf particularly road construction initiatives and won major contracts due to its ability to undercut competitors as this economic activity intensified gulf arab states initially tolerated chinese competition within their borders more recently however this competition has extended to regions where both china and gulf arab governments are pursuing lucrative development projects such as in the horn of africa gulf arab states particularly the uae and to a lesser extent saudi arabia and kuwait certainly do not want a confrontational relationship with china in these environments they view china as a critical market as a result leaders in the gulf have pursued memoranda of understanding mous and commitments of shared investment with beijing in return chinese policymakers have articulated an interest in the gulf and wider middle east premised on deeper ties that extend beyond the development or trading spheres an approach illustrated clearly in their 2016 arab policy paper thus while gulf china relations remain competitive they are at least on paper based on mutual interests rather than an adversarial spirit within the gulf itself the uae was the first gulf arab state to sign multiple high value commitments of investment with china kuwait and saudi arabia subsequently followed suit in this sense chinese investment has become trendy for gulf leaders however this process does not indicate any real direct competition between gulf arab states rather it appears as a symptom of broader governance inclinations within the region as activities in one state prompt similar efforts elsewhere gulf arab states most importantly saudi arabia and the uae have struggled recently to look beyond state manipulated economies as part of large scale reform efforts part of this trend has been an emphasis on privatizing historically state owned enterprises while boosting foreign investment outside the oil and gas sectors how have gulf arab leaders understood chinese interest in the region within the context of their long term economic reform how do economic policymakers in the gulf understand the chinese funding model the economic reform agendas pursued by saudi arabia and other gulf arab states since 2014 2015 has essentially become a search for alternate sources of revenue due to declining oil prices this search has revolved around the implementation of new taxes and fees on commodities like electricity fuel and water however most gulf arab states have not meaningfully reduced their fiscal spending saudi arabia for example is today spending more than it ever has on public sector services but it is changing the nature of its spending initiatives exist to privatize state assets but this process has proceeded very slowly within this changing economic environment the idea of a chinese buyer has not presented any problems for gulf leaders looking to boost revenue yet china is not necessarily the most important actor within this privatization context for example south korea has produced more firms that stand to become owner operators of saudi or emirati public utilities than has china in these countries it is common to see large scale water treatment facility or power plant projects wholly or partially managed by south korean firms like the korea electric power corporation kepco within the gulf banking sector as well chinese entities have not emerged as primary actors nor have they been seen as presenting any kind of economic threat to existing banking institutions to this end most saudi emirati and kuwaiti banks currently maintain either direct state ownership or ruling family ownership china is not looking to take control of gulf arab economies on a large scale the true sites of competition have emerged in lower income economies most importantly in the horn of africa where both gulf arab and chinese interests are at odds with one another for example the uae s major port operator dp world has come into direct competition with chinese counterparts in bidding for contracts at the port of djibouti in reality gulf arab banking systems more closely mirror chinese systems than they do western ones the other similarity between gulf and chinese finance is that both models are closely tied to state directed lending in the gulf this system is based on the rentier model essentially when oil and gas prices are high the state earns more revenue which it then deposits into the local state owned banking sector this cycle shapes the character of gulf arab lending and project spending while the gears of china s financial system are not necessarily fueled by natural resource revenue the chinese government does similarly push banks to continue lending at a high rate in order to drive economic growth therefore gulf arab and chinese financial systems present similar kinds of vulnerabilities this relationship presents a crucial danger for leaders in the gcc and beijing if oil prices drop and chinese demand for natural resources diminishes both economic systems suffer as essentially occurred in 2014 despite these challenges gulf leaders remain optimistic regarding the potential for chinese economic engagement regionally nobody wishes to see china s economy fail rather the gulf states ultimately wish to maintain a consistent chinese demand for their export products as well as continued revenue from sources like chinese tourism particularly in dubai or real estate investment gulf arab states have emerged as global development actors providing large scale capital states across the red sea basin yemen sudan and jordan north africa egypt and tunisia and the horn of africa ethiopia djibouti and somalia how have gulf leaders understood and structured new investment and development models within areas like the horn of africa how might such gulf arab economic penetration re shape regional development efforts and investment initiatives this is a critical question that has received insufficient attention essentially neither the gulf arab states nor china appear to have developed any coherent vision for economic development the investment strategies pursued by these actors have instead proven site specific and designed to feed cycles of continued growth within domestic economies this situation has proven problematic for recipient states unlike the western model which is premised on multilateral institutions such as the world bank and a focus on long term local institutional growth to build inclusive societies gulf arab states lack such a coherent strategy for the export of their economic development model the leading economic actors within the gcc remain very comfortable as does china with the familiar kind of state centric approach to development that worked in the gulf itself yet this model is not as easy to export outside the gulf region as leaders there might have hoped for example in egypt saudi and emirati investors sought to mimic the kind of luxury housing and real estate projects that proved successful in their own countries in an effort to address egypt s housing shortage however the egyptian context demanded low income and highly scalable solutions not an influx of expensive housing projects that did not meet the country s pressing needs this failure provided a bitter lesson for gulf investors and development policymakers regarding the need to find locally tailored solutions that meet recipient state goals rather than attempting to shoehorn the gulf economic system into foreign environments in the future yemen will prove a critical case study in saudi and emirati post conflict reconstruction as will somalia and ethiopia gulf arab success in these environments will depend on two factors first gulf leaders will need to better incorporate conditionality into their lending and development policies for example saudi arabia and the uae recently pledged to provide nearly 20 billion in economic and development support for pakistan far surpassing the kind of funding that multilateral institutions like the international monetary fund imf could provide crucially neither riyadh nor abu dhabi has developed a robust project pipeline or evaluation process by which to monitor whether the recipient state has achieved funding goals this lack of conditionality in the terms of saudi and emirati aid thus puts an overwhelming onus on the recipient state to manage and assess project spending as well as to ensure that riyadh and abu dhabi deliver the pledged amount such massive injections of funding into environments like pakistan can prove incredibly destabilizing to the recipient state if not properly managed gulf arab economic statecraft in development regions has hitherto been conducted at an extremely personal level essentially over the phone leader to leader without any complementary on the ground management of spending crucially none of the gulf arab states possess an independent development agency like usaid or britain s dfid that can plan and assess big dollar commitments abroad ultimately the gulf arab states will likely be forced to reconfigure their development apparatuses as they continue to expand foreign aid and assistance programs both regionally and globally in doing so they will likely face significant challenges that might slow or derail efforts to build institutional capacity not least of which is a cultural hesitancy to seek credit and recognition for any generosity that stems from the region s islamic governance structures while gulf arab states have spent heavily in developing and disaster impacted regions they often fail to track or publish figures regarding amounts given today gulf leaders must decide whether they want to formalize and institutionalize aid programs in yemen for example it appears that saudi and emirati officials have chosen not to pursue such a policy saudi arabia has tightly controlled the flow of international assistance into the country much to the detriment of yemenis who have not received assistance such failures are ultimately not due to insufficient spending but rather to a lack of institutional capacity to direct aid where it is most required sino gulf economic visions will focus on state centric growth and maintenance of domestic political stability how will the injection of capital into gulf arab economies from partners like china reconfigure regional political or diplomatic relationships between arab states it is useful to note that the world s most important financial poles are shifting high value deals are no longer exclusively struck in new york city or london from the perspective of gulf arab economic policymakers it is increasingly possible to find financial success by looking east as it is by looking west entry into the united states market is less of a priority for middle east entrepreneurs and investors as it might have been a decade ago today regional observers are witnessing the widening of a market that is perfectly content to expand without integration into us or western systems this trend challenges traditional conceptions of economic growth best practices within the gulf these transformations have important implications for how regional policymakers seek and spend foreign investment funds consider for example basic contract law in an economically multipolar environment where might compliance or enforcement disputes be settled the answers point to potential challenges in the future to established corporate governance practices transparency and regulatory mechanisms among gulf arab states to date there has not yet been a significant case of a spoiled deal that would allow observers to assess these regional transformations chinese funded projects such as oman s duqm port development however may soon present gulf leaders with such a dilemma as gulf arab states expand foreign assistance and investment programs they have entered regions particularly the horn of africa where beijing has sought to build its own robust international development presence do gulf leaders envision competing against chinese investment projects in these arenas what are the implications of this diversification in funding sources for recipient states the gulf arab states and china do not yet appear to consider each other as competitors in the international development environment rather these states have increasingly taken advantage of a general opening of the development assistance space that has occurred over the past decade the international system fostered by the 1944 bretton woods agreement which among other institutions established the imf and world bank is increasingly frayed as the financial capacities of alternative states and economic models grow these alternatives are not yet well articulated but they nevertheless offer recipient states options with regards to development assistance that did not exist historically on one hand these trends will present serious challenges for both recipient governments and international monitors in terms of ensuring transparency and accountability of development funds on the other hand increased competition for development contracts between multiple differing models may offer recipient states greater agency over budgets and implementation but this interpretation may ultimately prove too optimistic while western aid agencies such as usaid or dfid traditionally leverage foreign assistance in part to pursue national security oriented strategies promoting democratic governance and institutions that are amenable to donor state interests for example gulf arab development assistance has not yet been politically linked in this regard crucially the gulf tendency to pursue highly personalized diplomacy may backfire in countries with high government turnover to date gulf arab states have been disappointed on several occasions after an investment or development deal they thought to be solid ultimately spoiled as occurred for example in somalia these experiences have taught regional leaders that they cannot not rely on deals reached with a single foreign representative rather it is important to negotiate with foreign institutions in order to protect overseas investments this learning process is still in its nascent stages and it will be critical to watch how gulf arab states manage it moving forward
investors who are already on the trade will be mindful of managing their exposure it s never wrong to take a full or partial profit on a position as for those investors who missed the initial move but now feel 2019 will indeed see a broadly lower us dollar to chinese yuan exchange rate it might be advisable to take a moment to reflect indeed some likely drivers of the yuan s early january rise may prove short lived as goes january so goes the year if that s the case chinese yuan strength in the early weeks of this year should mean a strong performance versus the us dollar in 2019 as a whole but such has been the pace of this yuan rise investors might be disinclined to chase the move from current levels such a cautionary approach might well be justified on the issue of yuan appreciation potential it might well be that markets which in the second half of 2018 were exposed to a plethora of reports about the challenges facing china s economy were probably psychologically ill prepared and so ill positioned for renminbi strength as 2019 dawned initial yuan appreciation in the first days of january arguably triggered a snowball effect as investors for fear of being left behind felt compelled to pile into the renminbi a bank employee uses a money counting machine to count out 100 yuan notes at a bank in shanghai in august 2018 the yuan recovered some of its value versus the us dollar at the start of the year photo afp in truth markets may have underestimated the prospects for china in comparison to those of other major economies indeed while analysts continue to evaluate the implications of beijing potentially setting a lowered target for chinese economic growth in 2019 of 6 to 6 5 per cent over in the euro zone germany s economy shrank by 0 2 per cent in the third quarter of 2018 german economy minister peter altmaier even felt it necessary to state last week that germany is not currently at the beginning of a recession meanwhile in the united states amid political gridlock in washington and with the economic sugar rush of the trump administration s 2018 tax cuts wearing off markets have become less enamoured with the notion that holding the greenback is presently the optimum foreign exchange trade that evolution in investor thinking has also been driven by evidence that the upward trajectory of federal reserve rate hikes is levelling off after four rate hikes in 2018 which played no small part in supporting us dollar strength fed chief jerome powell said on january 10 that especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently us federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks during a press conference in washington on december 19 2018 when the central bank raised short term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point but signalled a slower pace of rate hikes in 2019 photo xinhua on a comparative basis and with all foreign exchange trades being a decision based on the perceived merits of different currencies relative to each other the arguments in favour of the yuan over in particular the us dollar start to build up there s also an argument that while the people s bank of china will be unlikely to want to see yuan strength run away beijing might well have made the calculation that a degree of renminbi appreciation can only help in tricky trade negotiations with washington the trump administration has previously been vocal about chinese currency weakness but the trade negotiations are themselves a double edged sword market expectations of a successful outcome to those talks have been rising and that has arguably fuelled yuan demand just as the deterioration in china us trade relations last year fed into renminbi weakness yet time is short for those trade discussions the end of the 90 day truce period that emerged after china s president xi jinping met his us counterpart in buenos aires in december falls on march 1 there is therefore a real if unquantifiable risk that any setback in the current trade negotiations will seriously undermine the short term case for yuan strength there is also the possibility that the pace of early 2019 yuan strength has been built on speculative demand but also on seasonal factors the impact of the latter may soon fade with the year of the pig beginning on february 5 and given the duration of the public holidays in china it would be perfectly rational to expect chinese exporters who naturally convert overseas revenues into yuan to have been front loading their hedging activities once the spring festival is over those exporters may revert to a more normal pace of operations there are persuasive arguments in favour of yuan appreciation versus the us dollar in 2019 and early january has already seen the renminbi achieve a material rise versus the greenback but that rise has been sustained by a combination of speculative and seasonal demand that may not persist at current levels yuan bulls might wish to proceed with a degree of caution neal kimberley is a commentator on macroeconomics and financial markets this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as will year

by obinna chima the minister of budget and planning senator udo udoma has assured that the federal government is putting in place measures necessary to ensure that the economy grows rapidly while maintaining fiscal sustainability udoma who acknowledged that the country faces significant challenges with respect to revenue generation said the government was putting in place measures to vigorously address the situation macroeconomic stability has been largely achieved growth is expected to increase from 0 8 per cent in 2017 to 2 1 per cent in 2018 and 3 01 per cent in 2019 with the continuing implementation of the economic recovery and growth plan he told senior media editors at the weekend in lagos he stated employment growth usually slows down during recession and takes some time to recover it is not surprising that the national bureau of statistics nbs data shows that unemployment and underemployment remain high in nigeria however it must be emphasised that what the nbs report shows is not that jobs have been lost it actually shows that there have been a significant net job creation but that the level of growth in new jobs is less than the number of new entrants into the job market hence a net increase in unemployment rate we expect a more diversified and inclusive growth over the medium term and reduction in the rate of unemployment as we continue to implement the economic recovery and growth plan ergp meanwhile analysts at csl stockbrokers limited have warned that notwithstanding the winner of the forthcoming presidential election nigeria will face a very tough year to this end they have called for radical reforms to spur economic growth in the country the csl stockbrokers gave the warning in their 2019 macro economic outlook titled a bumpy ride ahead obtained by thisday at the weekend the lagos based investment bank stressed that nigeria faces a challenging year amid a slowing global economy elevated geopolitical risks and fragile investor sentiment considering developments in the global economy such as monetary policy normalisation in some advanced economies the trade war between the united states and china as well as the volatile crude oil market the analysts noted that the nigerian economy enters this difficult global environment in a poor state as economic growth struggles to exceed two per cent with third quarter gross domestic product gdp at 1 8 per cent nigeria s current account also moved into deficit in the third quarter of 2018 while the parallel market exchange rate came under some pressure in addition it noted that public debt in nigeria is already at uncomfortable levels and continues to rise and neither of the two prominent presidential candidates have indicated in their manifestos that they understand the macroeconomic challenges facing the country it added the uncertainties around the election itself pose a threat to the ability of the country to attract much needed foreign investment and tap international debt markets this will also make financing the budget deficit more expensive without radical reform nigeria will face a very tough year gdp growth will struggle to reach two per cent with increasing pressure on the exchange rate the naira is expected to depreciate to a range of between n385 n390 inflation is also projected to hit a 15 20 per cent range at year end 2019 and we see the government struggling to finance itself as there s not much upside to oil price expected csl stockbrokers which is a subsidiary of fcmb holdings further projected an average price of 60 per barrel in 2019 government debt could also balloon out if yields turn markedly upwards and interest payments increase significantly it stated the report predicted that in the year ahead risks to monetary policy and inflation are skewed to the upside it pointed out that with the us fed poised to raise their benchmark interest rate at least twice in 2019 foreign capital outflows in nigeria might intensify in addition the uncertainty surrounding the 2019 elections could deter further foreign investment as foreign investors take cover in higher yielding less risky investment securities in the us it added on the back of this the monetary policy committee mpc might be compelled to raise the monetary policy rate mpr in a bid to stem the outflow of foreign capital while we envisage a steep increase in inflation to a range of between 15 20 per cent at year end 2019 we however expect inflation to remain at current levels till after elections

volatility in sterling is much higher than euro volatility and that s unlikely to change any time soon all eyes on the big vote in parliament on tuesday and for sterling moves below 1 25 or above 1 30 are both on the table 2 is there a powell put the fed reckons the world s biggest economy is continuing to motor ahead but markets seem to think otherwise their fears for growth outlook knocking equity prices off record highs more recently though they have cheered fed chairman jerome powell s comment that the u s central bank can be patient in approving any further rate increases powell said that especially with inflation low and under control the fed can be patient and watch patiently to figure out which of the two competing narratives unfolds in 2019 so whose view is correct it s true labor markets are robust and wage inflation has been on the rise average earnings rose in december by 3 2 percent on an annual basis matching october s rise which was a 9 1 2 year high but workers wage gains are also being eroded by inflation with core cpi seen above the fed s 2 percent target in coming months powell s newly dovish sounding rhetoric has prompted money markets to price out fed rate rises in 2019 but the producer price index ppi due jan 15th could be key if it shows inflationary pressures cooling there could be a further reprieve from markets rate hike concerns 3 quarterly earnings reports start up banks first global stock markets have suffered in recent weeks on fears that economic growth and company earnings are on the decline upcoming u s company earnings will test this view big u s hitters due to issue q4 results next week include micron technology netflix and major wall street banks citi jpmorgan and wells fargo money has started trickling back into equity

of 2018 the slowest since q3 2017 sharply lower than the 28 4 percent rise in q3 2018 and almost flat year on year and confidence in europe is even lower earnings per share eps for stoxx 600 companies is expected to have grown 7 1 percent in q4 half the levels seen in q3 and q4 2017 forecasts as recently as november were for 14 percent growth but a spate of nasty macro economic surprises has caused

s export growth data in focus china and the united states have held their first face to face talks since the two world powers agreed a 90 day trade war truce described as extensive the talks have helped cheer up global equity investors but risk aversion could rear its head again should hard data from china show what damage has been done to the economy by the initial tariff rounds in particular focus will be on chinese export growth analysts expect that to have cooled for a second month in december as front loading of u s bound cargoes faded this was indeed the case on monday poor data is another incentive for beijing to be more accommodative with fiscal and monetary policies it has already engaged a reserve ratio cut for banks which should pump the equivalent of 115 billion into the economy what remains to be seen is how accommodative it might be with u s demands on trade 5 turkey and south africa in the tank already having just suffered its worst year in the best part of two decades the turkish lira has had a tumultuous start to 2019 it s weakened more than 2 percent year to date and worse still it experienced a flash crash on jan 3 which was a reminder of all its vulnerabilities from geopolitics to upcoming elections and haphazard monetary policy on the positive side the lira s near 30 percent tumble in 2018 had got rebalancing off to a fast start turkey is now posting large current account surpluses and inflation albeit high is on the decline but many worry that these very factors could tempt the central bank back onto the interest rate cutting path on wednesday at its first meeting of 2019 the central bank is expected to stand pat with 17 out of 19 economists seeing key rates steady at 24 percent but two predicted a cut and the bank s own survey finds that turkish interest rates are seen falling almost 500 basis points in the coming year the picture is less dramatic in south africa which is seen leaving interest rates unchanged at 6 75

china s economic slowdown is causing alarm around the world but president xi jinping s government may be willing to go only so far to limit the damage beijing on tuesday announced 1 3 trillion yuan 193 billion worth ofnew measures designed to stimulate the economy including tax cuts for small businesses and reduced tariffs it s the latestin a flurry of government effortsto prop up growth in recent months such as boosting infrastructure spending and looser monetary policy weakening growth in the world s second biggest economy combined with the trade war with the united states has spooked investors and prompted warnings from top companies like apple aapl experts question whether beijing s measures will be enough to stimulate the economy it ll take a lot more to pull china out of what feels like a recession said scott kennedy an expert on the chinese economy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington the country s official growth rate is expected to be around 6 5 for 2018 the weakestin nearly three decades and to drop closer to 6 this year but many analysts are skeptical about the accuracy of the government figures and say growth may be significantly lower in reality plenty of signs are flashing red in december chinese exports suffered a surprise decline while annual car sales in 2018 fell for the first time in around 20 years preventing growth collapsing part of the problem is that china s easing measures could be hitting the wrong targets the central bank has gradually cut the amount of cash commercial banks are required to hold as reserves that should mean banks have more money to lend to businesses encouraging investment and economic activity the problem is that money doesn t flow into the real economy larry hu chief china economist at investment bank macquarie said in a note to clients this month banks are instead parking the cash in chinese government bonds or lending to inefficient state run businesses which often use it to rollover their existing debts this money would be more effective if it was directed to private businesses according to hu rather than fueling a rebound the central bank s recent cuts may only prevent growth from truly collapsing said christoper balding a china expert at the fulbright university vietnam in ho chi minh city more stimulus incoming burgeoning evidence that the slowdown is getting worse makes more stimulus measures all but certain in recent months beijing has moved ahead with plans for billions of dollars of new railway projects and tax cuts for small businesses officials also say they are preparing measures to help the struggling auto industry but beijing s efforts won t kick in straight away it will take several more months of easing before the economy and stock market begin to feel the benefit said chen long an analyst at research firm gavekal chinese stocks had a miserable 2018 suffering from the slowdown and the trade hostilities with the united states and until stimulus measures start having a real effect market momentum is going to deteriorate further long said lessons from the big bang china s plans this time around are small change compared with the big bang stimulus it launched in response to the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 beijing injected nearly 600 billion into its economy to fight off the effects of the global slowdown china still has a lot of ammunition in terms of the moves it can make said jeff ng chief asia economist at research firm continuum economics but he warned that there are side effects one concern is the huge amount of debt in the country s financial system the chinese economy expanded rapidly in the years after the global financial crisis thanks to repeated debt binges but that left it nursing a hangover president xi and other top officials have in recent years pressed china s financial system to cut down on riskier lending a campaign often referred to as deleveraging but as the economy has weakened the priority has shifted in view of the extraordinary difficulty that china is facing amid trade tensions china is willing to halt its deleveraging efforts in order to defend growth said janet mui an economist at investment firm cazenove capital in london losses in the stock market have increased the pressure on authorities to keep adding stimulus she said the risks of runaway stimulus but too much stimulus runs the risk of adding to china s already worrisome debt levels it could also pile pressure on the country s currency which despite a recent rally is still down significantly against the dollar over the past year that could lead to renewed fears of investors moving huge sums of money out of china and increase trade tensions with the trump administration which has repeatedly accused beijing of weakening its currency to boost chinese exporters chinese policymakers are wary of broad based stimulus in high dosages said darren tay a country risk analyst at research firm fitch solutions loosening monetary policy too quickly could indeed cause the yuan to weaken quickly repeated injections of cash into the economy may also add fuel to china s red hot property market and damagingly distort its industrial sector in december prices of chinese industrial and manufactured goods rose at a much slower pace than expected some analysts suggest this may mean china is again starting to suffer from overcapacity production that exceeds demand and lowers global prices we believe beijing is painfully aware of these risks which is why we do not expect runaway stimulus this time around said tay
beijing china on jan 15 signaled more stimulus measures in the near term as a tariff war with the united states took a heavy toll on its trade sector and raised the risk of a sharper economic slowdown the world s second largest economy will aim to achieve a good start in the first quarter the national development and reform commission ndrc said in a statement indicating the government is ready to counter rising pressure central bank and finance ministry officials gave similar assurances surprising contractions in china s december trade and factory activity have stirred speculation over whether beijing needs to switch to more forceful stimulus measures though most analysts believe the government is wary of steps that could heighten debt risks and weaken the yuan data on tuesday showed credit growth remains stubbornly weak with several key gauges hovering around record lows despite months of policy easing further economic stimulus measures will be needed the authorities seem to be taking their time to deliver this perhaps chastened by the overkill of their stimulus in the financial crisis ing economists said in a note to client the eventual package may be very substantial some analysts believe china could deliver 2 trillion yuan 296 21 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects most however expect the fresh stimulus will take months to start feeding through the world s second largest economy with a turnaround not expected till spring or summer china s growth

the proposed target to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in march was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed door central economic work conference in mid december the sources told reuters annual growth of about 6 2 percent is needed this year and in 2020 to meet the ruling communist party s longstanding goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020

and medium sized firms beijing has also cut taxes and fees and stepped up infrastructure investment to shore up the economy this year china will step up fiscal expenditure and implement larger tax and fee cuts the cuts will focus on reducing burdens for small firms and manufacturers the finance ministry said in a statement on tuesday but government efforts to channel more funds to the struggling

in its 2019 outlook report the wgc said geopolitical risks that weighed on global economic growth in the second half of 2018 would likely carry through to 2019 that uncertainty would be a boon for gold prices as investor demand is expected to fire up for gold s effective hedging role although the wgc did not weigh in on the specific price movement potential for the yellow metal its analysis came at a time when gold prices have been holding steady near six month highs and are ostensibly aimed at the us 1300 oz mark spot gold traded at 1291 30 in new york today we believe that in 2019 global investors will continue to favour gold as an effective diversifier and hedge against systemic risk and we see higher levels of risk and uncertainty on multiple global metrics the wgc said the outlook contrasted with gold s price performance in 2018 which saw significant headwinds such as a strong greenback successive rate hikes by the us federal reserve as well as accommodative policies from other central banks the us economy was further boosted by the trump administration s tax cuts which helped fuel positive investor sentiment and pushed us stock prices higher through to the start of october however the wgc said as geopolitical and macroeconomic risks increased emerging market stocks pulled back and developed market stocks ultimately followed this resulted in short covering in gold with its price ending the year near 1280 oz outperforming most global assets the wgc said despite reflecting a 1 year on year price decline increased market uncertainty and protectionist economic policies were expected to make gold more attractive as a hedge but higher interest rates and us dollar strength impacts would be muted because of the fed s more neutral stance protectionist policies are inherently inflationary either as a result of higher labour and manufacturing costs or as a result of higher tariffs imposed to promote local producers over foreign ones they are also expected to have a negative effect on long term growth the council said structural economic reforms in key markets would continue to support the demand for gold in jewellery technology and as a means of savings the wgc said despite 2018 recording net positive flows into gold backed etfs north american funds suffered significant outflows in the second and third quarters and the trend only reversed in the fourth quarter as risks started to intensify volatility metrics had also started to creep up with the vix jumping from an average of 13 in the september quarter to an average of 21 in the last quarter of 2018 the analysts also noted the market was signalling a growing risk of a recession as the us yield curve flattened the 2s 10s curve currently stands at 13bps a level of curve flattening last seen before the 2008 financial crisis with some economists predicting its inversion in the first half of 2019 while an inverted yield curve does not cause recessions it has generally preceded them albeit with a long lead the wgc said in the us the 10 year treasury yield is 1 5 below its 2008 pre lehman crisis level providing investors less cushion in case of further market volatility the analysts said

have cooled faster than expected late in the year despite a slew of growth boosting measures in recent months ranging from higher infrastructure spending to tax cuts some analysts had already speculated that beijing may have to speed up and intensify its policy easing and stimulus measures this year after factory activity shrank in december advertisement advertisement china s december exports unexpectedly fell 4 4 percent from a year earlier with demand in most of its major markets weakening imports also saw a shock drop falling 7 6 percent in their biggest decline since july 2016 analysts had expected export growth to slow to 3 percent with imports up 5 percent today s data reflect an end to export front loading and the start of payback effects while the global slowdown could also weigh on china s exports nomura economists wrote in a note referring to a surge in shipments to the u s over much of last year as companies rushed to beat further tariffs the export growth print also suggests that the recent strength of the yuan might be short lived beijing will perhaps be more eager to strike a trade deal with the u s and that policymakers will need to take more aggressive measures to stabilise gdp growth advertisement advertisement net exports had already been a drag on china s economic growth in the first three quarters of last year after giving it a boost in 2017 asian shares and u s stock market futures fell as the surprisingly weak chinese data added to fears of weaker corporate profits and investment while the yuan currency gave up some of its early gains higher trade surplus with u s china s politically sensitive surplus with the u s widened by 17 2 percent to 323 32 billion last year the highest on record going back to 2006 according to reuters calculations based on customs data china s large trade surplus with the united states has long been a sore point with washington which has demanded beijing take steps to sharply reduce it advertisement advertisement washington imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese goods last year and has threatened further action if beijing does not change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property china has retaliated with tariffs of its own however beijing s export data had been surprisingly resilient to tariffs for much of 2018 possibly because companies ramped up shipments before broader and stiffer u s duties went into effect as many market watchers predicted that boost has faded in the last few months china exports to the u s declined 3 5 percent in december while its imports from the u s were down 35 8 percent for the month china s total global exports rose 9 9 percent in 2018 its strongest performance in seven years while imports increased 15 8 percent advertisement advertisement but december s gloomy data along with several months of falling factory orders suggest a further weakening in its exports in the near term a trade recession is likely in our view raymond yeung chief economist at anz said in a note predicting a period of export contraction similar to 2015 16 the global electronics cycle remains the key driver of chinese exports a potential downturn in the sector poses the real risk to china s external outlook even if china and the u s reach a resolution on their trade dispute ing said a fall in electronic shipments could be related to foreign companies avoiding using china made electronic components adding that exports and imports of electronic parts and goods will likely shrink this year advertisement advertisement weak imports highlight softening demand the higher tariffs china levied on u s supplies also hit overall import growth for all of 2018 soybeans the second largest imports from the u s fell for the first time since 2011 even if washington and beijing reach a trade deal in their current round of talks it would be no panacea for china s slowing economy analysts say the import slowdown is consistent with other signs that growth in china s domestic economy continued to weaken said louis kuijs head of asia economics at oxford economics overall economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter and remains under pressure from weaker exports slow credit growth and cooling real estate activity advertisement advertisement chinese policymakers are widely expected to roll out more support measures in coming months if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate early this month the central bank said it would slash banks reserve requirements the fifth such cut in a year as it tries to encourage more lending and reduce the risk of a sharp slowdown if pressure on the economy is still relatively large in the first half a cut every quarter should be highly likely said xu gao chief economist at everbright securities in an annual meeting of top leaders last month china said it will boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and stepping up policy adjustments advertisement advertisement a few analysts believe interest rate cuts are a possibility but most expect beijing will refrain from massive stimulus measures like those deployed in the past due to worries that it could add to a mountain of debt and weaken the yuan sources told reuters last week that beijing is planning to lower its economic growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year after an expected 6 6 percent in 2018 the slowest pace in 28 years reporting by yawen chen stella qiu lusha zhang and martin pollard editing by kim coghill
china on tuesday signaled more stimulus measures in the near term as a tariff war with the united states took a heavy toll on its trade sector and raised the risk of a sharper economic slowdown the world s second largest economy will aim to achieve a good start in the first quarter the national development and reform commission ndrc said in a statement indicating the government is ready to counter rising pressure on growth surprising contractions in china s december trade and factory activity have stirred speculation over whether beijing needs to switch to more forceful stimulus measures though most analysts believe the government will avoid doing so due to worries it could heighten debt risks and weaken the yuan further economic stimulus measures will be needed the authorities seem to be taking their time to deliver this perhaps chastened by the overkill of their stimulus in the financial crisis ing economists said in a note to client the eventual package may be very substantial some analysts believe china could deliver 2 trillion yuan 296 21 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects most however expect the fresh stimulus will take months to start feeding into the economy china s growth slowed in 2018 as a years long campaign to reduce a mountain of debt and a crackdown on riskier lending practices hurt domestic demand as the trade war with the united states escalated last year and hit exports global financial markets went into a tailspin on worries about a sharper china slowdown though many analysts believe an economic hard landing is unlikely premier li keqiang said china achieved its key 2018 economic targets which were hard won and seeks a strong start to the economy in the first quarter to establish conditions helpful to meeting this year s goals according to state television on monday sources told reuters last week that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 per cent this year after an expected 6 6 per cent in 2018 the slowest pace in 28 years the proposed target to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in march was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed door central economic work conference in mid december the sources told reuters annual growth of about 6 2 per cent is needed this year and in 2020 to meet the ruling communist party s longstanding goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020 and to turn china into a modestly prosperous nation china has lowered the level of reserves that commercial banks need to set aside for the fifth time in a year to spur lending particularly to small and medium sized firms beijing has also cut taxes and fees and stepped up infrastructure investment to shore up the economy this year china will step up fiscal expenditure and implement larger tax and fee cuts the cuts will focus on reducing burdens for small firms and manufacturers the finance ministry said in a statement on tuesday stabilizing employment is the government s top priority ndrc vice chairman lian weiliang said at a press conference on tuesday briefing reporters on the measures that are in the works following december s economic work conference no flood of stimulus china will speed up investment projects and local government bond issuance but will not resort to flood like stimulus lian said the central bank in a separate statement issued at the press conference said it will maintain prudent monetary policy with appropriate tightness and looseness monetary policy will be made more forward looking flexible and targeted the people s bank of china pboc said but a prudent monetary policy does not mean that there will be no changes pboc deputy governor zhu hexin said at the press conference apart for cutting the reserve requirement ratios rrrs for commercial banks the central bank has also increasingly turned to open market operations in particular the medium term lending facility or mlf to support liquidity cutting benchmark interest rates may be the last resort as that could weigh on the yuan and fuel debt risks analysts say when asked if the pboc should cut benchmark rates zhu said existing monetary policy measures should be improved regarding the question of interest rate cuts people are paying more attention to it our current monetary policy including overall policy rrr cuts and medium term lending facility helps us adapt to the overall economic environment and price levels zhu said overall monetary policy is gradually taking effect in the economy we should look to improve our existing policies and make dynamic assessments on that basis he said chinese banks extended 16 17 trillion yuan 2 40 trillion in net new yuan loans last year the pboc said in its statement released at the press conference blowing past the previous record of 13 53 trillion yuan in 2017 in december banks extended 1 083 trillion yuan in net new yuan loans according to reuters calculations based on previously released central bank data that was more than market expectations of 800 billion yuan but down from 1 25 trillion yuan in november despite the rrr cuts china is confident about the yuan currency our exchange rate regime is a floating one based on market supply and demand we have confidence on this aspect considering our economy and our foreign exchange reserves zhu said

january 15 2019 revisions to the federal reserve dollar indexes bastian von beschwitz christopher g collins and deepa d datta1 data appendix available here starting in february 2019 the federal reserve will make important changes to the foreign exchange rate indexes included in the h 10 g 5 and g 5a releases the changes include revisions to the weighting scheme and country composition this note details the construction of the indexes and describes the motives for the changes to the methodology 2 i index construction the federal reserve dollar indexes are designed to help estimate the overall effects of u s dollar exchange rate movements on u s international trade there are three indexes the broad dollar index which is constructed using the currencies of the most important u s trading partners by volume of bilateral trade and two sub indexes which split the currencies in the broad index into advanced foreign economies afe and emerging market economies eme 3 this section describes the methodology for constructing these indexes that goes into effect starting in february 2019 the next section describes how this methodology differs from the prior approach section 3 describes how these changes are implemented and section 4 examines the effects of these changes the broad dollar index contains the currencies of 26 economies for which bilateral trade with the united states accounts for at least 0 5 percent of total u s bilateral trade these economies are listed in table 1 the afe dollar index contains seven currencies and the eme dollar index contains the remaining 19 currencies consistent with market practice daily changes in the indexes are computed using geometrically weighted averages of changes in bilateral exchange rates the index at time t i_ t is i_ t i_ t 1 pi n t _ j 1 e_ j t e_ j t 1 w_ j t 1 where pi represents the product operator i_ t 1 is the value of the index at time t 1 e_ j t and e_ j t 1 are the prices of the u s dollar in terms of foreign currency j at times t and t 1 w_ j t is the weight of currency j in the index at time t n t is the number of foreign currencies in the index at time t and the weights sum to one sum_ j w_ j t 1 the weights are computed using annual bilateral trade data published by the bureau of economic analysis bea for each economy j the weight at time t is w_ j t frac t_ us j t sum n t _ j 1 t_ us j t 2 t_ us j t m goods _ us j t m services _ us j t x goods _ us j t x services _ us j t 3 t_ us j t is the total bilateral trade between the united states and economy j in year t as equation 3 shows it is the sum of four components 1 goods imports from economy j to the united states m goods _ us j t 2 services imports from economy j to the united states m services _ us j t 3 goods exports from the united states to economy j x goods _ us j t and 4 services exports from the united states to economy j x services _ us j t we exclude from this computation trade in oil gold and military equipment as exchange rate fluctuations usually have little effect on trade in these goods the weights for the different currencies in the broad afe and eme dollar indexes are reported in table 1 the four currencies with the largest weights are the euro 19 percent the chinese renminbi 16 percent the canadian dollar 14 percent and the mexican peso 13 percent these currencies account for 62 percent of the broad dollar index ii changes to the index construction the staff of the federal reserve board has computed the broad major and oitp dollar indexes since 1998 major and oitp are the previous names for the afe and eme dollar indexes while weights of the different currencies in the index are updated annually the currency composition of the indexes and the methodology to compute currency weights have largely stayed unchanged until now the following changes will be implemented starting in february 2019 addition of services trade weights will be based on both goods and services trade historically only goods trade was used to calculate trade weights simplification of weight calculations trade weights will be computed as a simple fraction of total bilateral trade previously they were comprised of 50 percent bilateral import weight 25 percent bilateral export weight and 25 percent export competitiveness weight which measured how much products from the specific economy compete with u s products in third markets periodic review of index currency composition the currency composition of the indexes will be periodically reviewed and currencies will be added and or dropped based on the most recent bilateral trade figures in the new indexes vietnam will be added and venezuela will be removed renaming of indexes the major index will be renamed to the advanced foreign economies afe index and the other important trading partners oitp index will be renamed to the emerging market economies eme index this change reflects the increased u s trade with countries in the eme dollar index the remainder of this section describes and motivates these changes in more detail 1 addition of services historically the weights in the federal reserve dollar indexes were based solely on trade in goods as data on services trade were not widely available however data availability has improved in recent years and the relative importance of services trade to the united states has increased see figure 1 in 2017 u s services exports accounted for 34 percent of total u s exports and services imports accounted for 19 percent of total u s imports in contrast in 1999 services accounted for only 28 percent of exports and 16 percent of imports to capture the increased importance of services trade starting in 2019 the index weights will be constructed including trade in services 2 simplification of weight calculations historically the federal reserve s dollar index weighted imports and exports equally and export weights included a measure of export competition in third markets the third party competitiveness weight was intended to capture the extent to which economy j and the u s economy competed in third markets going forward the trade weights will be computed as a simple fraction of total bilateral trade using equation 2 this change has two advantages in addition to simplifying the calculation of weights first since u s imports are larger than u s exports this measure more accurately reflects the u s trade balance second since the services share of u s exports 34 percent is much larger than the services share of u s imports 19 percent this measure also captures the relative importance of services in imports and exports there will no longer be an adjustment for global market competitiveness because data on global trade in services is not widely available 4 3 periodic review of index currency composition starting in 2019 the currency composition of the broad index will be periodically reviewed when the broad major and oitp dollar indexes were created in 1998 26 economies that made up at least 0 5 percent of either bilateral goods exports or goods imports were included in the index while currency weights have been updated each year the set of currencies has stayed the same the set of countries did expand as additional countries adopted the euro future inclusion in the index will be based on the same metric as the index weights the fraction of u s bilateral goods and services trade with each economy as a share of total trade excluding trade in oil gold and military equipment to avoid frequent changes an economy will only be included in the index once its bilateral trade with the united states accounts for significantly more than 0 5 percent of total u s trade for an extended period of time similarly we will only remove economies from the index once they account for significantly less than 0 5 percent of u s bilateral trade for an extended period of time 5 in table 2 we list economies in decreasing order of total bilateral trade share there are 24 economies with a total trade share of at least 0 5 percent twenty three of these economies are already included in the broad dollar index the only economy not included is vietnam vietnam has a trade share of 1 2 percent which is more than double the threshold of 0 5 percent furthermore the trade share of vietnam has been increasing in recent years accordingly vietnam will be added to the broad and eme dollar indexes of the economies below 0 5 percent total trade share three economies are currently in the broad dollar index russia sweden and venezuela of these economies russia and sweden have a total trade share that is very close to 0 5 percent and has been close to or even above that level in the past four years thus we decided to keep these economies in the dollar indexes in contrast the total trade share of venezuela is only 0 2 percent and has been declining in addition the official exchange rate of the venezuelan bolivar has little effect on trade flows as most transactions are conducted at the black market exchange rate 6 as a result venezuela is being removed from the exchange rate indexes after these adjustments the 26 currencies included in our exchange rate indexes cover about 90 percent of the total bilateral trade with the united states iii implementation of the changes the changes outlined in section ii will become effective on february 4 2019 as of that date the term broad dollar index will refer to the new dollar index as described in section i we will also provide a historical series for the new dollar indexes going back to january 2 2006 the weights of these dollar indexes will be based on the respective total bilateral trade with the united states including goods and services and vietnam will be included while venezuela will be excluded in addition we provide a time series of the new dollar indexes going back to 1973 here this series is based on estimated services trade weights before 2006 the estimation method is outlined in the appendix below to ease the transition we will continue to release the historical dollar indexes based solely on goods trade until december 31 2019 we will refer to these indexes as broad goods only major goods only and oitp goods only the weights for these indexes will remain at their current weights based on 2016 data vietnam will not be added to these indexes and venezuela will not be removed from these indexes iv effect of changes on index composition a comparison of the old and new weights is shown in table 2 columns 2 4 because there is relatively more services trade between the united states and the economies in the afe index the weight of the afes in the broad dollar index increases 5 1 percentage points from 43 2 to 48 3 percent the afes with the largest increases in weight are canada 1 7 percentage points the united kingdom 1 5 percentage points and the euro area 1 4 percentage points in contrast china s weight in the broad dollar index decreases 5 4 percentage points from 21 6 to 16 2 percent this relatively large decline is explained by two factors there is relatively little trade in services between china and the united states and china has a high competitiveness weight in goods trade the weight of mexico increases 0 5 percentage points and the weight of india increases 0 7 percentage points and vietnam is added with a weight of 1 3 percent the weights of other countries are little changed in figure 2 we compare the exchange value of the nominal broad dollar using trade weights calculated according to the old and new methodologies we show the official series from january 2006 which is the year in which services trade data becomes available for all countries in our dollar indexes in addition we provide an estimate of what the new dollar series would look like going back to 1973 7 overall the differences between the two series are very small from january 2006 to november 2018 the broad nominal dollar increased 0 2 percent less under the new definition in figure 3 we repeat the same exercise using the real broad dollar here the difference is slightly larger and goes in the opposite direction with the dollar appreciating 1 9 percent more under the new methodology in figures 4 to 7 we show the same comparisons for the afe and eme dollar indexes in all cases the difference between the two methodologies is small especially over the period since 2006 table 1 currency weights in the dollar indexes 2017 broad weights percent afe weights percent eme weights percent euro area 18 6 38

figure 7 real eme dollar indexes appendix construction of dollar weights this documentation details the construction of the dollar weights over the period 1973 to 2017 the weights will be extended each year as the data become available i trade weighting scheme the trade weights are computed using annual bilateral trade data published primarily by the bureau of economic analysis bea as described in the main text of the note for each economy j the weight at time t is w_ j t frac t_ us j t sum n t _ j 1 t_ us j t 1 where t_ us j t m goods _ us j t m services _ us j t x goods _ us j t x services _ us j t 2 in equation 1 w_ j t is the weight of currency j in the dollar index at time t t_ us j t is total bilateral trade between the united states and economy j in year t n t is the number of foreign currencies in the dollar index at time t and sum_j w_ j t 1 equation 2 captures the four components that comprise t_ us j t goods imports from economy j to the united states m goods _ us j t services imports from economy j to the united states m services _ us j t goods exports from the united states to economy j x goods _ us j t and services exports from the united states to economy j x services _ us j t we exclude goods trade in oil gold and military equipment when computing m goods _ us j t and x goods _ us j t since exchange rate fluctuations have little effect on trade in these goods we create the new trade weights in three steps we generate goods imports and exports series that exclude trade in oil gold and military equipment we generate services imports and exports series we compute trade weights ii country composition before proceeding to a discussion of each of the three steps involved a short word on the sample of economies we provide trade weights for the following 37 economies the 26 economies in the broad dollar index the 10 original countries of the euro area and venezuela which is included through 2005 for the euro area we follow the original implementation and calculate trade weights for the 10 initial members of the euro area from 1973 to 1998 and for the euro area 1999 onwards 9 for post 1999 the euro area series are aggregates of its constituent countries in any given year for example greece is first included in 2001 because it joined the euro area on january 1 2001 lastly consistent with the old dollar series russia is only included from 1993 iii goods imports and exports we construct bilateral goods imports and exports series excluding oil gold and military equipment from 1973 to 2017 although this document details the goods import data construction the procedure for exports is analogous for each country we use bilateral goods trade data from the bureau of economic analysis bea and the international monetary fund imf bea data on a balance of payments basis go as far back as 1978 while imf data from the direction of trade statistics dots provide coverage back to 1973 the trade flows series are generated at annual frequency and in millions of u s dollars we construct our desired goods imports series from 1973 to 2017 for each economy in three steps we create total goods imports series we create the sum of imports of excluded categories gold oil and military equipment we create our desired goods imports series net of excluded categories 1 total goods imports series depending on the country the bea data start in 1978 1986 or 1979 10 earlier years are filled in using the dots database 2 excluded goods imports series we compute excluded goods as the sum of trade in oil gold and military equipment 11 specifically we exclude trade in the following end use category codes nonmonetary gold 14270 imports 12260 exports special category military type goods 50000 and 50010 imports 5 exports and total oil 100 imports 111 exports if data are available for at least one of the three categories missing observations in other series are treated as zeros for that year if data in all three categories are missing we backfill them by assuming that the fraction of excluded goods of total imports remains constant for example suppose the sum of excluded goods for a given country only goes back to year t where t 1973 we assume that between 1973 and year t the share of excluded categories as a fraction of total goods imports remains constant at the value observed in year t text excluded goods _ j t frac text excluded goods _ j t text total goods _ j t text total goods _ j t 3 3 goods imports series finally we create our desired goods imports series m goods _ us j t by subtracting the sum of excluded categories from total goods imports a special case is taiwan for which we do not have total goods imports observations for the years 1973 to 1977 for this time period we assume a constant ratio between taiwan and all the other countries o included in the dollar index in 1978 for the desired goods series m goods _ us taiwan t frac m goods _ us taiwan 1978 m goods _ us o 1978 m goods _ us o t 4 iv services imports and exports similar to trade in goods we construct bilateral services imports and exports series from 1973 to 2017 the text below describes the construction for imports the procedure for exports is analogous 1 2006 to present services trade data are taken from bea table 2 2 u s trade in services by type of service and by country or affiliation 12 for countries with missing values in the most recent years namely cyprus and slovakia in the 2018 data release we fill forward using the most recently available value 2 1999 to 2005 as in the most recent period services trade data are taken from bea table 2 2 u s trade in services by type of service and by country or affiliation however a number of countries have missing data which must be estimated where available individual country level data are taken from bea table 2 2 if no country level data are available services imports for country j in year t are computed as text services imports _ j t text services imports _ o t frac text services imports _ j 2006 text services imports _ o 2006 5 where o is the other countries in region value for the region of country j for example if country j is austria the o will be other in the

aly song chinese president xi jinping speaks at the opening ceremony of the first china international import expo ciie in shanghai china on nov 5 2018 xi has vowed to widen access to china s economy reuters aly song c hina on tuesday signalled more stimulus measures in the near term as a tariff war with the united states took a heavy toll on its trade sector and raised the risk of a sharper economic slowdown the world s second largest economy will aim to achieve a good start in the first quarter the national development and reform commission ndrc said in a statement indicating the government is ready to counter rising pressure central bank and finance ministry officials gave similar assurances surprising contractions in china s december trade and factory activity have stirred speculation over whether beijing needs to switch to more forceful stimulus measures though most analysts believe the government is wary of steps that could heighten debt risks and weaken the yuan data on tuesday showed credit growth remains stubbornly weak with several key gauges hovering around record lows despite months of policy easing further economic stimulus measures will be needed the authorities seem to be taking their time to deliver this perhaps chastened by the overkill of their stimulus in the financial crisis ing economists said in a note to client the eventual package may be very substantial some analysts believe china could deliver 2 trillion yuan 296 21 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects most however expect the fresh stimulus will take months to start feeding through the world s second largest economy with a turnaround not expected till spring or summer china s growth slowed in 2018 as a years long campaign to reduce a mountain of debt and crackdown on riskier lending practices pushed up borrowing costs dampening investment and hurting domestic demand as the trade war with the united states escalated last year and hit exports global financial markets went into a tailspin on worries about a sharper china slowdown though many analysts believe an economic hard landing is unlikely premier li keqiang said china achieved its key 2018 economic targets which were hard won and seeks a strong start in the first quarter to help meet this year s goals according to state television on monday sources told reuters last week that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year after an expected 6 6 percent in 2018 the slowest pace in 28 years the proposed target to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in march was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed door central economic work conference in mid december the sources told reuters annual growth of about 6 2 percent is needed this year and in 2020 to meet the ruling communist party s longstanding goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020 and to turn china into a modestly prosperous nation china has lowered the level of reserves that commercial banks need to set aside for the fifth time in a year to spur lending particularly to small and medium sized firms beijing has also cut taxes and fees and stepped up infrastructure investment to shore up the economy this year china will step up fiscal expenditure and implement larger tax and fee cuts the cuts will focus on reducing burdens for small firms and manufacturers the finance ministry said in a statement on tuesday but government efforts to channel more funds to the struggling private sector are facing big hurdles banks are wary of more bad debts amid the long regulatory crackdown and many business are in no mood to make new investments in the face of faltering sales stabilising employment is the government s top priority ndrc vice chairman lian weiliang said at a news conference on tuesday briefing reporters on the measures that are in the works following december s economic work conference no flood of stimulus china will speed up investment projects and local government bond issuance but will not resort to flood like stimulus lian said the central bank in a separate statement issued at the press conference said it will maintain prudent monetary policy with appropriate tightness and looseness monetary policy will be made more forward looking flexible and targeted the people s bank of china pboc said but a prudent monetary policy does not mean that there will be no changes deputy governor zhu hexin said apart for cutting the reserve requirement ratios rrrs for commercial banks the central bank has also increasingly turned to open market operations in particular the medium term lending facility or mlf to maintain a generous pool of funding cutting benchmark interest rates may be the last resort as that could weigh on the yuan and fuel debt risks analysts say when asked if the pboc should cut benchmark rates zhu said existing monetary policy measures should be improved regarding the question of interest rate cuts people are paying more attention to it our current monetary policy including overall policy rrr cuts and medium term lending facility helps us adapt to the overall economic environment and price levels zhu said overall monetary policy is gradually taking effect in the economy we should look to improve our existing policies and make dynamic assessments on that basis he said chinese banks extended a record 16 17 trillion yuan 2 40 trillion in net new yuan loans last year the pboc said blowing past the previous high of 13 53 trillion yuan in 2017 but growth of outstanding total social financing tsf slowed to an all time low as the squeeze on shadow banking slowly shuts off a major source of funding for smaller companies despite concerns that continued policy easing will pressure the yuan currency central bank officials said they were confident the exchange rate could be

it has been two years since the explosive surge of the democratic socialists of america now the largest socialist organization in the united states and the largest since the 1940s and dsa has had some remarkable successes today as the country turns its attention to the presidential election of 2020 we ask how dsa is doing what is it accomplishing and where is it going what do the various caucuses and political tendencies within dsa propose as a future direction for the group is there a genuine left wing of dsa and if not what is the alternative in the last two years the democratic socialists of america has become a phenomenon on the american left with more than 50 000 members in scores of chapters in every state of the union dsa has now become the largest socialist organization in the united states since the 1940s when the communist party had about 100 000 members and alongside dsa the young democratic socialists of america is also spreading across college campuses bringing thousands of young people into the orbit of socialism dsa s spectacular surge has been accompanied by a growing appreciation of socialism among democrats as the gallup poll reported in august of 2018 for the first time in gallup s measurement over the past decade democrats have a more positive image of socialism than they do of capitalism attitudes toward socialism among democrats have not changed materially since 2010 with 57 today having a positive view the major change among democrats has been a less upbeat attitude toward capitalism dropping to 47 positive this year lower than in any of the three previous measures many dsa members hope that given these attitudes they can recruit more democratic party s progressives and also influence the party itself though there is great debate about the strategy the eagerness of some accompanied by the skepticism of others all of this began with bernie sanders 2016 campaign for the democratic party s presidential nomination when sanders called himself a democratic socialist young people went to google to search for the term and found dsa read about dsa and its ideas and were impressed social mediaâ and some dsa wranglersâ did the rest and soon the organization had 20 000 members then donald j trump won the presidency in november 2016 and frightened by the prospect another 20 000 or so joined and most recently alexandria ocasio cortez s victory in june a democratic congressional race defeating democratic caucus chair joe crowley brought in a few thousand more nothing is simpler than joining no questions asked no probationary period just go to dsa ask to join pay the minimal dues and presto you re a member here was a generation of young people largely from middle class families who after having been thrilled by president barack obama had become deeply disappointed in him even if well educated they frequently carried the burden of a large college loan debt and many of them often highly skilled became contract laborers with little job security while others serve beer in the bars or wait tables in the clubs they have grown up in a nation engaged in a permanent war in iraq afghanistan and half a dozen other countries while at the same time they have observedâ if they have not personally been involved inâ the occupy wall street movement and black lives matters they have been influenced by the successful fight of the lgbt movement to end don t ask don t tell and to gain marriage equality while mostly white in a nation where whites will soon be a minority their college experience and then their jobs brought them into contact with asian latino and black people and exposed them to all of the debates over identity politics out of all of this they have come to dsa with idealism and tremendous desire to make a better world thousands of dsa s new members mostly young people between 25 and 35 coming out of the broad progressive milieuâ most with no previous experience in the social movements or left groups and little experience beyond the bernie campaignâ signed up and soon became activists not only in political campaigns but also in dsa s working groups that are involved in a variety of social movements from health care for all to fights for low income housing from opposition to police racism and abuse and defense of immigration rights to the struggle against climate change from union organizing campaigns and strike support to building a socialist feminist movement participating in civil disobedience in various cities a several new dsa members have been arrestedâ their first arrestsâ fighting against trump s kidnapping of immigrant children or for some other worthy cause dsa chaptersâ divided in big cities into several branchesâ introduce members to socialism educate members about the history of the left and provide classes on marxist theory sprinklings of exiles and refugees from other leftist organizations who joined dsa have mostly brought leaven to the loaf and in between all the meetings and protests there are social events at the barsâ meet ups of black or latinx socialists of retail workers or teachers or just gatherings after the chapter meetingsâ where over the suds every conceivable issue is discussed we have not had such a vibrant left in america for forty or fifty years no socialist group this big in 70 years and nothing exactly like this ever everyone on the left should celebrate this remarkable development which is not to say there are no problems but many are good problems almost all of them necessary ones and only a few of them seriously troubling the real issue is the direction where is dsa going and the biggest question regarding the group s future is its relationship to the democratic party a party itself in flux will dsa whose rebirth began in sanders democratic party primary campaign be able to attain escape velocity and become a truly independent socialist organization or will the greater gravity of the democratic partyâ its size money influence connections powerâ succeed in keeping dsa within its orbit from spring s halcyon days to fall s sturm und drang early 2017 those were the halcyon days the enormous influx of members transformed dsa into what was virtually a new organization the individuals who had joined in ones and twos or in small strings of friends found themselves in meetings with many others much like themselves forming new friendships as they revitalized old chapters formed new chapters and elected local leaderships everywhere they established new working groups and marched together behind dsa s red banners in what were for many their first picket lines or protest demonstrations dsa s national director maria svart and the organization s miniscule staff did a remarkable job of keeping on top of a group that doubled in size every few months advising new chapter leaders creating new structures and publications sending out inspiring emails urging members to keep up the fight the goodwill among the members and the good nature of most of them was remarkable to those of us who had come out of an older left made up of smaller groups formed in the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s and then tested in the long dry spell of the 1980s and the intermittent struggles of the 1990s and 2000s discouraging and embittering some then suddenly the new dsa a breath of fresh air the dsa newcomers as i said joined and found others like themselvesâ perhaps too much like themselves most of dsa new members were college educated people many of them here in new york for example employed in technical jobs or with professional careers in tech publishing or design in los angeles there s quite a contingent of film industry workers others everywhere form part of the new precariat employed in coffee shops restaurants and bars or working a couple of gigs to put together the rent with their roommates few dsaers are married or have children and few are over 50 or even over 30 most members are white and the proportion of people of color in dsa is less than that in american society as a whole and similarly with union members and men generally outnumber women though the difference between the two is not extreme certainly not as out of kilter as in some small left groups that are practically boys clubs lgbt members have found themselves in a group which if not always as sensitive to such issues as it might be has proven capable of learning everywhere dsa members are conscious of these race and gender issues and anxious to make the organization more representative of the american working class as a whole at the august 2017 dsa convention its ranks swollen with younger more radical members dsa moved to the left adopting a series of measures that seemed to break with the group s social democratic past the convention delegates voted to leave the socialist international si based on the argument that the european social democrats had become the enforcers of neoliberalism and austerity while si affiliate parties in many developing countries headed up authoritarian governments the convention also voted to support the boycott divest sanctions bds campaign and to oppose efforts to criminalize the movement the delegates wanting to turn dsa in a new direction also voted to establish a people of color caucus and a labor commission and finally the convention made a single payer health care system a national objective not surprisingly given the rising temperature of politics in the country and the crises in the major political parties as that last dsa convention approached significant political differences had already appeared in the dsa differences that reflected debates on gender race and class taking place in the academia in the media and in the social movements consequently for the first time in the group s history caucuses and rival slates made their appearance and there was a serious scuffle if not a battle for leadership of the group following the convention strife continued among a scribbling minority on social media where snide matched snark and ad hominem tweets and posts sometimes verged on character assassination though the great majority of the members remained aloof from the mud and the dreck we seem to have come through the worst of that sturm und drangâ or to have become habituated to itâ and have moved on to more serious discussion and debate over our future harrington and the dsa old guard we should pause a moment to put dsa today into a little historical perspective dsa s roots go back to the social struggles of the 1950s and 1960s and the civil rights and anti war movements in those days the old socialist party in which dsa has its rootsâ that is the party of eugene v debs who went to prison for opposing world war iâ had moved to the right and come out as a supporter of the u s war against vietnam the socialist party s anti stalinism too much resembled the liberal state department anti communism of americans for democratic action ada in the late 1960s michael harrington the sp s youngish leftish face he was just 40 years old then alienated the young radicals of students for a democratic society sds because he told them they weren t sufficiently anti communist causing the sp to lose its relationship to the largest and most important left movement of the 1960s sds went off to be taken over by the stalinist of the progressive labor party at that time pro communist china and the radical liberals of the revolutionary youth movement rym and the weathermen who broke windows and built bombs and carried out some bombings and armed robberies killing a few of themselves and a couple of others after harrington turned his back on sds only a small group found its way to socialist politics through groups like the international socialists i was one of those then the socialist party s support for the vietnam war finally drove harrington out of the party in 1972 and the following year he and his followers created the democratic socialist organizing committee dsoc harrington had a strategic perspective that inspired the new organization as he argued in his book socialism he believed then that if the unions the civil rights organizations and the anti war movement could be brought together within the democratic party that they could drive out the southern racists and the corrupt big city machines and transform the democratic party into a labor party at that time harrington and his friends had ties to both black leaders of the civil rights movement and to important leaders of major industrial and public employee unions while the anti war movement was still in the streets harrington s strategy seemed to have legs harrington s plan of working within a capitalist party represented a fundamental break with socialist theory and practice since karl marx initiated modern socialism in europe or since debs had led the movement in america socialists had historically rejected involvement in capitalist political parties believing that working people needed their own political party if they were to overthrow capitalism and establish a socialist order but harrington was not the first one to give up the marxist position over the century from 1870 to 1970 the various left parties had by various paths come to reject marx s admonitions about the role of capitalist parties and the capitalist states the communist party had during its popular front period in the 1930s and 1940s worked in an alliance with the progressive democrats and in other countries with other capitalist parties even conservative parties justifying its position by the need to stop the nazis during that era when the cp s american leader earl brower proclaimed that communism is twentieth century americanism the communist party had grown to 100 000 members with an estimated one million people in their periphery during the same period in europe the labor socialist and social democratic parties after more than a century of involvement in bourgeois politics and following the disastrous civil wars world wars of 1914 1945 had emerged as reformist capitalist parties the socialist parties now managed capitalism their strategy in places like scandinavia became a model for harrington s program for america harrington s political position with its resemblance to the communists popular front and to european social democracy made it possible almost a decade later for dsoc to merge with the new american movement nam a new left organization formed in 1971 some of whose leaders were former pro soviet communists while some others inclined toward communist china or fidel castro s cuba and in general many were sympathetic to the third world nationalist movements the nam also brought concerns about feminism and the environment that had not previously formed part of the dsoc worldview the combined organization had 6 000 members 5 000 from dsa and 1 000 from nam it was at this point that dsa staked out its big tent approach and conception of a mutli tendency organization the old dsa having broken with its marxist origins and with revolutionary socialism required a new theory and its intellectuals found it in interpretations of antonio gramsci s prison notebooks and in the writing of thinkers on the left of the european socialist parties like the french writer andré gorz the greek french political scientist nicos poulantzas and the british sociologist ralph milliband all of these intellectuals starting with gramsci emphasized the theory of hegemony the relative autonomy of the state from the capitalist class and the political struggle within the existing capitalist parliamentary governments as interpreted first by richard healey and later by joseph schwartz socialists should first adopt gramsci s viewâ at least for the presentâ that we are engaged in a war of position that is an attempt to build organizations influence politics and win hegemony while eschewing a war of movement that is a head on revolutionary confrontation with the state sometimes there was a suggestion that the long slow gradual war of position would eventually lead to the war of movement to revolution though by postponing the war of movement indefinitely revolution receded into by infinite regress not into the future but into oblivion secondly dsa s theorists argued socialists should emphasize gorz s theory of non reformist reforms that is profound reforms that would tend to break out of the limits of the capitalist system the unaddressed problem was that such reforms would either tend to strengthen the capitalist state or would tend to make capitalism less profitable leading employers and politicians to turn to the right and to repression if the latter then the right would then initiate the war of movement for which the left had not been prepared in any case in the hands of dsa s intellectual and political leaders all of this theory served primarily to justify work in the democratic party so dsa from its founding in 1982 worked in the social movementsâ that were then in the doldrumsâ and often endorsed candidates for election in the rightward moving democratic party in the 1990s dsa grew to 10 000 members as it worked closely with the congressional progressive caucus to oppose president bill clinton s regressive policies dsa s commitment to work in the democratic party to an alliance with the more progressive labor bureaucracy of the united auto workers afscme and the iam and its soft support for israel practically defined it as a liberal organization just as old style liberalism went into crisis and decline the new dsa that emerged two years ago after the bernie bump was fundamentally different in temperament it was made up of people furious with hillary clinton and the democratic party national committee and with its chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz at that moment many hated the democratic party altogether some wanted bernie to run as an independent or to create a new party the seething anger at the democrats made possible dsa s 2017 convention break with the socialist international and the other progressive resolutions passed at that meetingâ but it didn t lead to a break with the democrats and as we will see the old dsa strategy based on an orientation to the democratic party remained a powerful and attractive current but first let s look at dsa s social movement activism which constitutes most of the organization s actual work because we want to consider the relationship between social movement activism and politics dsa at work with its new members dsa has over the last two years been able to launch more campaigns enter into more coalitions and simply do vastly more work dsa s national health care campaignâ we need medicare for allâ gives the lie to theoretical debates about an irrepressible conflict between economic reductionism and concern for particularly oppressed groups by proposing a broad economic change that would particularly improve the conditions for women and people of color while medicare for all would be good for all it will be especially good for the working poor for low wage workers for the precariat for african americans latinos and women in new york city the socialist feminist working group has played a leading role in the health care campaign canvassing neighborhoods and phone banking for the new york health act today the fight for health care for all stands at the center of dsa s political program the immigrant justice working groups around the country have been fighting the role of the immigration and customs enforcement ice agents who frequently arrest people showing up in court for their immigration hearings as witnesses in criminal cases or simply as standers by who fit the profile of immigrants whatever that is some dsa members have been arrested in protests against these practices in new york dsa s ijwg protests have been accompanied by the presentation of a petition with thousands of signature demanding an end to ice in the courts to new york state chief judge janet difiore who has permitted their presence nyc dsa has worked with groups such as the new sanctuary coalition to educate immigrant communities about their rights and how to protect themselves from unlawful ice actions the dsa ijwg activists have also mobilized to show solidarity with the recent immigrant caravans some traveling across the country to welcome those seeking refuge and asylum at the border some dsa members from various chapters are now in tijuana and san diego to offer assistance to the migrants the fight against gentrification and rising housing costs as well as the protection of public housing also constitutes an important part of dsa s activism in many cities almost everywhere this is a struggle against powerful banks realtors and construction companies by working class and poor communities often made up largely of low income people of color dsa joins with these housing activists and with community organizations to educate renters about their rights sometimes creating tenant unions and organizing neighborhood meetings protest demonstrations and testifying at public hearings sometimes dsa s work in this area involves lobbying and legislation these fights may pit dsa socialists against supposed progressive local politicians in brooklyn dsa joined with the crown heights tenant s union to oppose the transformation of the city owned huge block square bedford union armory into luxury housing the coalition took the fight to the democrats progressive city council where while it didn t win all it asked for did win many more affordable housing units dsa also works on housing legislation in california dsa s housing group supported proposition 10 the affordable housing act would allow communities to expand and strengthen tenant protections legalizing rent control for every california renter regardless of what kind of home they live in the legislation was defeated 6 3 to 4 2 million votes but the defeats on these issues in new york and california are only battles in a much longer war and the question to which we turn below is what lessons are being taken from these experiences into the labor movement dsa has made labor a focus of its activity and in a way different than it did in the past harrington and the old dsa had had an alliance with the liberal wing of the labor bureaucracy most importantly walter reuther of the united auto workers reuther and his successor leonard woodcock both former socialists who supported the most liberal democrats fought for higher wages and benefits for workers but neglected rank and file workers demands for more a more human workplace those leaders also neglected the issues of black autoworkers and when the black autoworker rebellion took place in the late 1960s with the organization of the dodge revolutionary union movement drum walter reuther called the black workers racist while another uaw official called them black fascists the alliance with the uaw officials and other union leaders put the dsa at odds with activists in the unions organizing a rank and file movement in opposition to both the auto companies and the union leadership of course dsa also always had some dedicated worker activists and local union officials who tried to fight the good fight even when their leaders failed to but by the 2010s there weren t many labor activists left today the democratic socialist labor commission has nearly 700 members nationwide described as union members and stewards union staff workers center activists union officers labor journalists union retirees students in labor solidarity groups labor oriented intellectuals or in any other kind of role in the movement dsa s monthly newspaper the democratic left recently published a special labor issue that made clear the group s commitment to more democratic and militant labor unions dsa s labor work has been strengthened by several members of solidarity who joined dsa many of whom who have years of experience in the unions and have played an important role in helping to organize and to orient dsa s labor work the solidarity members and many other dsa s are committed to a rank and file approach described by kim moody decades ago and as laid out succinctly in an article jane slaughter wrote for the democratic left rank and file organizing by workers on the job and at the unions grassroots is intended to fight the bosses and when necessary to fight union officials who stand in the way it is meant both to build the labor movement and to recruit workers to socialism and to the dsa while some dsa labor activists may have other approaches this seems to be the dominant trend at the moment dsa members are now working with labor notes the labor education center that has helped rank and file labor activists come together in various unions to build a more militant and democratic labor movement while in the 1970s many young leftists went to work in the mines in steel mills auto plants at the telephone company or as truck drivers and dockworkers among many others today dsa members look to other industries as slaughter wrote to build this fight from below some dsaers are getting jobs in multiracial workplaces that show potential for ferment these include teaching healthcare and logistics dsa has on its website an article titled why socialists should become teachers which talks about the role that a few dsa members played in the recent west virginia teachers strike a few dsa members that were teachers in west virginia public schools began having conversations about new austerity measures facing public employees our wages had been stagnant for yearsâ unlike our healthcare costs which were climbing we formed a reading group held brainstorming sessions and quickly agreed that winning our demands would require militant action we had no idea that we were laying the groundwork for what would culminate in a historic successful nine day strike that spread like wildfire to oklahoma kentucky arizona colorado and beyond the article goes on to make a compelling case for dsa members to take up a career in the field of teaching a number already have and not only in west virginia other dsa members have salted that is taken jobs to support union organizing campaigns in unorganized warehouses all of this suggests that dsa stands poised to play a role in the labor movements of the coming decade and if successfulâ and this is the hopeâ could begin the process of transformation into a largely working class organization the issue of race given the long history of racism in america from slavery and jim crow to pervasive discrimination throughout the last century and the phenomenon of contemporary color blind racism it is not surprising that dsa like every other institution in america would also have challenges in dealing with the race issue we in dsa find ourselves dealing with a debate over economic reductionism on the one hand and identity politics on the other a false dichotomy in my view but also with tensions between members of various ethnicities and various politics over the handling of race issues a recent article in the new republic do america s socialists have a race problem suggested that dsa and in particular its momentum the call an important national group that plays a leading role in the east bay and philadelphia chapters had dealt disastrously with racial issue the article painted a false picture of an organization about to be torn about by racial issues in response nearly a dozen dsa members of color responded with an article in the call criticizing the author s method and distortions in the article the authors write contrary to what salazar s piece implies all political tendencies within dsa agree on the importance of fighting racial oppression all agree that it s a problem that dsa is largely white and all agree that dsa must be a democratically run socialist organization the main point of disagreement that remains is how to most effectively address these issues and concerns absolutely true the collective article in the call suggested that dsa would in the long run overcome its most important race problemsâ the small percentage of members of color and particularly black members and a lack of a base in communities of colorâ through it work in the social movements in the unions and in political campaigns that would bring about new recruits and closer community ties while there is some truth there involvement in movements and growth in members of color will have an impact but the organization most also grapple with theories and attitudes with internal structures and political processes the new republic piece focused as it was on the issue of racial tensions in dsa made it seem as if dsa was afflicted with race problems while the article in the call does not appear to recognize the depth of feeling and deep concern among many dsa members about the group s theory and practice in confronting racism we might note that adolph reed jr who is not a dsa member enters into this debate within and about dsa with the worst possible and least useful termsâ which side are you on â demanding that the left choose between a social democratic program and the politics of racial identity politics once again the false dichotomy dsa is not the organization portrayed by salazar but the call s defensive response doesn t address the issue adequately either momentum the call tends to emphasize a universal economic program while other membersâ while not necessarily interested in promoting identity politicsâ want more emphasis on the issues of racial and gender oppression and on the need for the self organization of oppressed groups we need a political approach that understands that capitalism leads to both the exploitation of workers and the oppression of blacks and latinos and women and lgbt people and so we need the self organization of and the relative autonomy of those groups and their struggles within the broader fight for socialism politics socialists and the democratic party while dsa is and does many things electoral politics has probably galvanized and mobilized more members than any other activity this is not surprising given the fear that president donald j trump s authoritarian white nationalist government is perceived by many as the first step to something worse and even to fascism electoral politics offers the hope of actually changing the people and the parties that dominate government as well as altering governmental policies and the work is rewarding political campaigns provide opportunities for many to contribute creating databases developing and designing campaign materials canvassing neighborhoods identifying voters and in the end getting out the vote electoral work knocking on doors and talking with people in their homes can be interesting and fun a real learning experience for young people especially about who lives in the neighborhood and what those people are thinking in some areas such as new york city dsa has been able to mobilize hundreds of members and in one as many as 2 000 in local campaigns the sense of having worked in a common activity is also important to dsa in creating a common sense of identity the work has been so successful that today most people probably know of dsa as the group that elected two of its members alexandria ocasio cortez and rashida harbi tlaib to the u s congress as well as another the controversial julia salazar to the new york state legislature other dsa candidates also won election to their state legislatures mike sylvester in maine gabriel acevero and vaughn stewart in maryland and summer lee sarah innamorato and elizabeth fiedler in pennsylvania many other socialists won municipal elections or were elected to democratic party positions socialist organizations have seen nothing like this since the socialist party of america of the 1900sâ though the strategy is quite different than it was then the socialist party of that era ran candidates on its own ballot line not in another party eugene debs the perennial presidential candidate and most prominent leader of the spa told the voters it is for me to say to the thinking workingman that he has no choice between these two capitalist parties that they are both pledged to the same system and that whether the one or the other succeeds he will still remain the wage working slave he is today dsa on the other hand has decided to run most of its candidates as democrats and though the long term strategy remains somewhat vague it may encourage illusions that the democratic party can be reformed or taken over does dsa like the old harringtonites have such a strategy or is it using the democratic party simply to build its own organization and its own electoral machines there are many views of this question within dsa including some dsaers who don t support running in the democratic party at all one can see the problems with work inside the democratic party when one looks at the record of alexandria ocasio cortez a dsa member whose victory in a democratic party congressional primary election in new york stunned the country and thrilled dsa members today ocasio cortez is an exemplar progressive participating in an illegal demonstration in nancy pelosi s office to demand a serious democratic party position on global warming calling for a green new deal opposing the amazon deal in new york city and supporting laid off workers but ocasio cortez also caused consternation in dsa when she came out in support for all democrats thereby including andrew cuomo early in september 2018 dsa members by and large loathe cuomo and her support for him shocked many the new york city dsa leadership criticized ocasio cortez for her endorsement of cuomo and other democrats writing we reject the illusion that the democratic party is or will become an institution serving the interests of the u s working class she also shocked many dsa members with her twitter message upon learning of the death of senator john mccain john mccain s legacy represents an unparalleled example of human decency and american service as an intern i learned a lot about the power of humanity in government through his deep friendship with sen kennedy that a socialist and presumably an anti imperialist and an internationalist could praise as an example of human decency a man who bombed vietnam supported the invasion of iraq in 2003 called for bombing iran and ran a racist campaign against obama was unacceptable to many in dsa incidents like these have raised questions not just about ocasio cortez but about the democratic party strategy so what next some in dsa have already come out for bernie in 2020 arguing that early involvement in his campaign will once again present progressive economic and social program popularize socialism and perhaps recruit tens of thousands more to dsa whether or not the bernie phenomenon can repeat itself remains in question there is no evil hillary clinton as a foil in the primary he will have competition from a host of other progressive democrats he will have to deal with charges of sexism in his 2016 campaign his platform will not be unique since the other candidates who will be his rivals have now adopted many of his ideas in fact the whole party may adopt them for 2020â in diluted and sometimes corrupted form having spent two years campaigning for democrats he does not have the reputation as an independent that he once had and the presence of a socialist candidate in a presidential election will no longer be a novelty then too bernie will be 79 an age many believe is too advanced for a president he would then be 83 at the end of his first term and 87 at the end of a second which is always a calculation in presidential elections such issues must affect people like ocasio cortez and many other progressives who have hesitated to endorse sanders at least so far while dsa likes sanders it is not clear that sanders values dsa sanders after all has his own electoral organization our revolution and while some dsa members work on its staff and are active within it it does not seem that they any significant political role at the sanders institute s inaugural gathering in vermont in november and december dsa members were not prominent the only dsa member among the speakers was cornel west a major black intellectual but a nominal dsa member who plays no role within the organization and is not associated with it in the public s mind so some in dsa would like to use the sanders campaign to boost its organization though it is not at all clear that sanders sees any special role for the group in his operation the context at the moment as we turn to dsa s future we should consider the state of the country today the united states despite what economists the media and politicians call a booming economy remains in turbulent political times as it has been since the 2008 great recession trump speaking to some victims of the economic crisis and to those who feared losing their social status created a new populist political force based on the conditions created by rightwing republicans and the failures of barack obama hillary clinton and the democrats trump and the republicans have since 2016 succeeded in hollowing out political democracy through gerrymandering and voter suppression in a variety of forms they have attacked and undercut social programs undermined environmental policies and regulations criminalized immigration and terrorized immigrants while at the same time encouraging racism and contributed to the growth of a far right that includes white nationalists and neo nazis the country has for two years verged on a constitutional crisis as trump has striven to create a unitary government with the republican control of all three branches tending toward one party rule and presidential domination a situation attenuated but not resolved by the democratic party s gains in the mid term elections of 2018 when thwarted by the courts trump has attempted to rule by decree returning to the economic situation the stock market has been erratic and there are fears of a coming economic crisis in many quarters throughout all of this trump who remains in contact by twitter with his 55 million followers has held on to the 35 percent of the american population that approves of him and his policies it remains altogether possible for him to win the next presidential election given this situation as we now go into the political campaign for the presidency in 2020 with the democrats deeply divided and an array of twenty some liberal and progressive contenders vying to become the party candidate tremendous political and popular pressure will build to support first in the primary a candidate who can win and then in the election to back any democrat against trump and similar forces will come to bear all down the ballot lineâ senators representatives governors mayors and city council membersâ with democratic party progressives playing the key role in attempting to pull those on the left into the vortex into the maelstrom of what an older generation called bourgeois politics and behind this will be in fact the bourgeoisie with its control of finance and industry of the media and much of the social media pouring billions of dollars into the coffers of pacs and buying up politicians wholesale toward the 2019 convention what does dsa propose to do in these times dsa of course being political and being made up of that most mercurial of elements ordinary human beings is not united within dsa various currents of opinion vague political tendencies and organized caucuses discuss sometimes debate and at the convention to be held in august 2019 will vote on the organization s leadership and policies vote on its future formally that is constitutionally dsa is a genuinely democratic organization though the rapid growth of the organization the increasingly dense proliferation of chapters working groups and committees the adoption all over the country of scores of local by laws and regulations and the large proportion of new members with only a year two or three in the group means that real democratic decision making has sometimes been hard to achieve consequently some leaders held over from the old harrington dsa staff members whose focus is on maintaining the organization and the attractions of political campaigns in the democratic party as well as the relatively low level of struggle in the labor and social movements in the country have meant that dsa has continued to move along its historic social democratic trajectory despite the influx of thousands of new young and often radical members the dsa ship wobbles in its orbit but so far has not reached escape velocity that would allow it to head towards an independent political perspective the old dsa that is before the sanders campaign had already defined itself as a big tent and constitutionally permitted the existence of organized political caucuses within the group though at that time there were none even now most dsa members don t affiliate with or even identify with national caucuses and the caucuses that exist don t capture or reflect the diversity of views of all dsa members most dsa members have formed political connections through friendship networks coming out of the chapters or working groups in small cities towns and rural areas dsa members may have strong ties because they feel themselves to be part of a beleaguered radical minority some dsa members feel more comfortable with lose networks and a publication such as build that tends to emphasize local community base building rather than with political caucuses organized caucuses however are likely to play the strongest role at the coming convention while the first real caucuses began to appear just before 2017 convention when a few caucuses developed today there are several some claiming several hundred members until a few months ago dsa has slew of caucuses from the the self proclaimed marxist momentum the call to the anarchist libertarian socialist caucus from the more social democratic old guard of the north star caucus now with some new members to the process and identity oriented praxis caucus and the revolutionary socialist refoundation caucus surprisingly praxis and refoundation disbanded in 2018 while momentum the call is planning on holding a national meeting to formally launch its caucus in early 2019 and meanwhile a new communist caucus has made its debut let s turn to look at these various alternative leadership groups the north star caucus many of the signers of the north star caucus statement were members of dsoc or of nam and have been members of dsa for decades they represent the organizational and political continuity of of the group a number have been leaders in their communities in social movements and in the labor unions for just as long though they are now also joined by some younger members the first principle of the caucus is this the defeat of trumpism and the republican majorities in congress and the states is a strategic imperative for democratic socialists it is a position that by deduction commits the caucus to support of the democratic party the statement goes on to read to defeat trumpism and the republicans we must recognize that the democratic party s decades long acquiescence to neoliberal policiesâ austerity privatization deregulation and corporate dominated globalizationâ has played a role in the rise of racist far right populism the democratic party has been too passive as these neoliberal policies have led to the decimation of unions in the united states and to the socioeconomic devastation of large swaths of its working class what this ignores of course is that the democratic party was not simply acquiescing and being passive but that it played an active role in the adoption of neoliberal policies and austerity with the clintons and obama having a major part it is this view that sets north star apart from the other caucuses formed by younger members which take a far more critical view of the democrats the communist caucus the communist caucus which was previously simply a local group in the bay area has announced that it will now become a national caucus the core of the communist caucus comes from a group of bay area leftists who were inspired by the italian marxists of the 1970s and current left communist formations like endnotes they entered dsa s east bay chapter and became involved in housing organizing with the goal of building tenant collectives and disrupting capital flows today others come from a more ideological standpoint many of which are left communists syndicalists class struggle anarchists post trotskyist ish etc the communist caucus sees its role as combating the jacobin magazine sponsored reformist agenda of working within the democratic party see seth ackerman for an example as a spokesperson for the communist caucus said we want to help newly politicized members get involved in organizing efforts that may lead to actual disruptions of capital as it exists on an everyday level doing this type of organizing means moving away from a liberal model that makes reformist demands on the state by way of organizing potential voters they oppose within dsa other groupings that are in our view social democratic they say that they do not oppose participation in elections in theory but they offer no strategy for independent political action to the left of the democrats while the communist caucus puts its emphasis on organizing its only significant project so far is its housing work which may not be enough to convince others that it has a way forward whether or not the communist caucus can develop a national following and play a role at the dsa convention in 2019 remains to be seen the libertarian caucus ideologically similar to the communist caucus though less strident the libertarian socialist caucus which claims some 700 members nationally defines itself this way we take libertarian socialism to encompass those parts of the socialist movement including syndicalists council communists anarchists cooperativists and municipalists among many others which have historically seen the surest path to socialism as residing in the creation of independent institutions in civil society that give the working class and ordinary people direct power over their lives while the list of radical tendencies they incorporate includes people who hold a variety of views the libertarians can be thought of as opponents of centralism and believers in what an earlier generation called participatory democracy the caucus stands for things like community councils mutual aid and a strategy based on dual power by dual power they mean the construction of local anti capitalist institutions that can over time be federated into an alterative economic structure their dual power strategy document offers a number of examples from the spanish general confederation of labor to cooperation jackson though they do not discuss the dsa s actual role leaning more toward the historic models of anarchism than toward those of socialism still oddly enough the libertarian caucus has in general accepted dsa s electoralist strategy despite its reported numbers this caucus seems unlikely to have much influence on the dsa convention 2019 even though many members like things like community organizing and mutual aid programs momentum the call of all of the caucuses over the last two years momentum the call is the most serious best organized and most dynamic the momentum group with its new publication the call is laying the basis for building a national caucus with a coherent political program and a clear organizational strategy many of momentum the call leaders came first out of the young democratic socialist yds and then went to work with the leftist publication jacobin momentum the call s talented leaders take on leadership roles in important national committees and in local branches of the organization they are among the best organizers speakers and writers in dsa yet some dsa members perceive some of its leaders as arrogant its organization as overly aggressive and its behavior as insensitive on questions of race and gender momentum the call tends to emphasize centralism in a group many of whose members prefer decentralization and momentum has a national strategy when other members prefer an emphasis on local and particular issues momentum the call group s politics like jacobin s could be described as left social democratic one could say left kautskyist or something like the old communists popular front or the eurocommunism of the 1970s and 1980s momentum the call has in general been a strong supporter of the dsa s endorsements of democratic party candidates in favor of endorsing both open socialists like ocasio cortez and tlaib as well as progressives such as cynthia nixon and it supports the call for bernie sanders in 2020 momentum the call has also been a leading group in building dsa s labor work and advocating a rank and file strategy with its emphasis on institution building on labor unions and politics the call rejects the label revolutionary socialist the call writes that on the one hand we reject a strategy of gradually winning reforms which never seeks to break with the capitalist system and that on the other hand we also reject a strategy of insurrection which mistakenly seeks to adopt a model from vastly different historical conditions and apply it to our situation today their platform cites vivek chibber s essay our road to power which i have criticized elsewhere the condemnation of a strategy of insurrection is a red herring since no one in dsa and virtually none in the broader left advocates a putsch momentum the call defines itself this way we are marxists who believe in a democratic road to socialism historically the term democratic road implied a gradual peaceful electoral transition from capitalism to socialism as opposed to a revolutionary strategy the call s rejection of reformism is belied by the commitment to the democratic road as the authors know that phrase the democratic road is identified with the post war social democracies and with the parties of eurocommunism and the democratic road is identified with the disastrous experience of the chile s democratic road pursued by salvador allende and the popular unity government a leadership with a failed strategy that is celebrated in the pages of the call president salvador allende of chile committed to the democratic road consistently sought compromise with the bourgeoisie and the military used his party and labor union apparatuses to restrain the militant workers movement and when that failed called out the police to repress strikes the result was counterrevolution military dictatorship and the suppression of progressive forces for a generation another outcome might have been possible had there been party based in the working class with a revolutionary strategy not one of reformist reforms emphasizing the government s nationalization of industry at the expense of workers power the historic alternatives are not as suggested by the call insurrection versus the democratic road but reform versus revolution and that remains the fundamental underlying choice of a political perspective even when revolution is not on the agenda at the moment revolution as a slogan of the left embodies the notions of intransigence in the struggle against capitalism and the complete abolition of capitalist institutionsâ above all the stateâ to make way for a democratic socialism from below the other caucuses with their emphasis on building local bases of struggle to be knit together overtime have a point but they do not lay out a national strategy for an alternative politics an alternative to the left of the democratic party the left alternative at the moment the broad left of american politics is held together by opposition to trump but with the mid term victory and with the possibility of a democratic party president in 2020 there will be a tendency to divide over the question of what is desirable and necessary versus what is possible the division in the democratic party between sanders and other progressives and between progressives and standard issue democrats will also be reflected in dsa we could already see this in the debate over nyc dsa s endorsement of cynthia nixon who had supported barack obama and hillary clinton with their neoliberal policies but who underwent an overnight conversion and could suggest that she was herself a democratic socialist nyc dsa with moment folks playing a leading rule opted for nixon if you cannot already feel the undertow it is because you have not yet walked far enough into the water what then is the alternative the alternative is a revolutionary marxist perspective that while recognizing revolution is not on the agenda puts the emphasis on the dynamic of social and labor movements informed by the idea that if those movement become large enough and strong enough they will tend to demand an independent political expression either by splitting the democratic party or by launching an independent movement we should take much of inspiration our strategies and our fundamental political outlook from grassroots movement from below such as occupy wall street black lives matters and the west virginia teacher strikes we should also look attempts in the united states and abroad to build parties to the left of the democrats and the social democrats the reason for running candidates in the democratic party should be to represent those movements and forces that have the potential not to reform or capture the democratic party but to lead to its crack up for clearly a new left political party will have to come out of a combination of the movements and of the working class base of the democrats all of this should be inspired by the idea that the goal is the complete overthrow of the capitalist system the government we have can never represent the interests of working people and the oppressedâ it needs to be dismantled and replaced by a different more democratic kind of government while the level of community and worker struggles remains low those should be where we see our future some in dsa like to put these arguments in terms of the classical positions of the past if that is the case then we should see this as a moment for emphasizing rosa luxemburg certainly not the german social democrat karl kautsky or the italian eurocommunist enrico berlinguer or even the bolshevik vladimir lenin we certainly don t want to create today an organization that combines centralization plus reformist politics the heart of luxemburg s politics was the idea of the dynamic interaction between the economic and the political between the party and the self activity working class and popular movements the self activity of working people and the oppressed the notion of self emancipation should be for us as it was for luxemburg at the center of our politics at this stage of the movement and this moment in history at the same time of course luxemburg stood for a centralized party that could provide leadership to the working class even if she differed with both kautsky and lenin about how such a party should be organized and should operate dsa members have to decide that they want to both express the working class s needs and desires and basing themselves in the working class to lead the working class toward revolution dsa remains the most dynamic and exciting organization on the left as we head now into the unfolding crisis of the last years of the donald j trump administration we in dsa will have an opportunity to decide and then to test our strategies and to draw lessons from the experiences two years later the new dsa remains an exciting experiment one that opens up important possibilities for the future and we should take advantage of them january 3 2019 new politics
published tuesday 15 january 2019 print disqus my two cents andy sutton graham mehl liquidity is becoming of central importance once again it is frequently mentioned in mainstream media articles interviews and educational programs it was a central point of discussion during the financial market blowout in 2008 the killing off of a little known until it was dead data series earlier this year by the not so usfed has gotten the beehive buzzing once again about a liquidity crisis or the possible aversion of one in the short term it has also gotten things buzzing about the longer term as well what happened late in 2017 the st louis fed stopped publishing interbank loan data period just prior to that the amount of interbank loans on a weekly basis dropped to zero in typical fashion however the fine folks at the central bank have cleaned up the series and the chart but not totally see below ironically if you search for interbank loans and you pull up the aggregate chart for all us banks you will see that the data ends on 12 1 2017 but the data for small domestically chartered banks ends 1 3 2018 leaving the extremely small blip above is this another m3 deal where a rather important data series was killed off to save the taxpayers money the excuse given for the cessation of m3 or did something fundamentally change in the way banks secure temporary liquidity here s what we think if you look at the chart you can see that interbank loans were dropping pretty steadily one can interpret that as a return to normalcy of sorts after the financial catastrophe in 2008 that interpretation probably isn t that far off there were a couple of periods where loans spiked late 2012 and early 2017 in particular these roughly coincide with the eurozone debt crisis playing out and some of the goings on across the atlantic then all the rumors about deutschebank started we are of the opinion that the not so usfed launched a pre emptive strike on another credit lockup by changing the way that its member banks owners by definition met their temporary liquidity needs it has often been said that the fed is the lender of last resort we believe the us central bank became the lender of all resort that it decided that all interbank loans would go through it rather than banks going to each other this is an important distinction because while banks are certainly good at colluding they are also very much interested in self preservation if there s a rumor that some bank x was in trouble they d turn off the phones when bank x comes calling about a loan think of the cold shoulder lehman s dick fuld got in september 2008 when he spent an entire weekend calling everyone but elvis with regards to securing a venture saving loan he didn t get one not even from the not so usfed we are very sure there was much more to this than was or will ever be told if this is the case why wipe out the data series and trigger a bunch of questions why not just continue the series and plop in the numbers the central bank lends out and leave it at that or just make it up like is done with so many other economic and financial statistics these days the bigger question regardless of why this was handled the way it has been and we readily admit neither us nor anyone else will probably ever know why it was done this way it begs a bigger question which has started to emerge in the minds of many around the globe is it possible for the not so usfed to go broke these questions are being asked for some very good reasons a look at the usgovt debt is the first 22t the debt of the us population is another the total amount varies depending on what sources you use but according to usdebtclock org total consumer debt is almost 19 5t throw in the notional value of that quaking house of cards known as derivatives and that s a whopping 602t again according to usdebtclock org we could keep going but we think you get the point this massive mountain is serviced by an m2 money supply that is reportedly just shy of 14 4t it takes a bit of understanding to get to the fact that money supply is transactional only it is not involved in the storage of wealth a quick example tom buys 100 shares of company x from joe tom transfers the payment through the automated clearinghouse ach joe then takes the payment and buys groceries tom now has 100 shares of stock and joe has groceries but the money is in the hands of the grocer ergo the money supply is lubricant for the economy transactional in nature we don t need hyperinflation just because the national debt is 22t or because a pile of financial derivatives with a notional value of over 600t exists but what about that pile of derivatives certainly it is unrealistic to conjure up a scenario where they all trigger at once many of the derivatives are stacked against each other it s a binary situation this or that not this and that let s say just for kicks that 5 of that pile would trigger and money would have to be paid out now you ve got a problem the 14t worth of us m2 is spread throughout the economy as we described above some of it is cash and that lives in bank vaults people s safety deposit boxes and contrary to the times even in their wallets some of it is probably buried underground remember the dollar is not just currency it is also a unit of account things can be worth so many dollars the net worth of everything in the us is far far in excess of the money supply money is transactional it zips around the economy we economists even measure the velocity at which it zips around it is very non cleverly called velocity of circulation if a 30t transaction would have to take place because 5 of the derivatives pile triggered it simply couldn t non monetary assets would have to be thrown into the mix to settle it because there aren t enough dollars for a transaction that big or alternatively additional dollars would have to be created for the purpose of making that transaction possible this is the sort of thing that keeps central bankers awake in a runaway environment like the world locked into now everyone assumes that the not so usfed can backstop any eventuality it is a weighty assumption present in many economic models and scenarios where different outcomes are gamed by modelers in an attempt to quantitatively assess risk the fed stands out as the lender of last resort this assumption is made because the dollar is the world s reserve currency stay with us here everyone needs dollars and as such it wouldn t be that big of a deal if the fed had to suddenly ramp up the money supply for a single enormous transaction or even a wave of smaller but equally inexecutable transactions below we point out a slight oddity the bulk of monetary inflation is created when new loans are taken out given the propensity of americans and their government at all levels to borrow fresh money on a regular basis monetary growth has settled to a tepid 5 give or take a few basis points we ll get to this point in our next column it is a very dangerous assumption built into it is the assumption that the world not just people in the us doesn t mind being robbed of purchasing power as more money is created it also carries the assumption that the rest of the world wants to exist in an unholy and clearly imbalanced financial relationship with a predatory monetary authority based on the number and frequency of deals being cut to sidestep the dollar it is safe to conclude that at least some of the world s population is no longer comfortable with the prior arrangement lastly there is perception it is the only reason people will accept intrinsically worthless paper tickets or equally worthless digital facsimiles thereof in exchange for goods and services produced with scarce land labor and capital nobody really thinks about it watch a bank robbery in a movie sometime what happens you have a few people convinced that it is worth spending the rest of their life in jail for a bunch of paper why would anyone do that because they perceive it to have value they know they can trade it for a bunch of stuff that really does have value back to our movie some brave individual will often try to take on the robbers usually unsuccessfully in an attempt to stop the robbery why would anyone in their right mind be willing to die for a bunch of worthless paper same answer as before they perceive the paper to be of value and thus the cause is a noble one in the end it s a completely tilted economic arrangement the holders of the dollar assume all risk the issuing authority assumes none of the risk the not so usfed is a glorified paper mill it has paper and digital assets some have value some are completely illiquid think of maiden lane llc 1 2 and 3 at the end of the day the question isn t whether or not the fed can go broke it already is broke it continues to exist based on several factors 1 the cost of unwinding dollar denominated arrangements 2 the difficulty in setting up a new system when there is full awareness that attempts to do so will likely result in sanctions smear campaigns and even military action and 3 people tend to think in the short term while making decisions that impact the long term the path of least resistance is to continue to tolerate the broken system even if all actors are aware that it is predatory thereby ensnaring countless future actors and transactions in the same broken system as mentioned above some countries are starting to buck this trend though and that is the dangerous part every deal that cuts out the dollar makes the news never in the us of course but elsewhere in the world alliances are being made based on a growing resentment of the forced usdollar hegemony that the world has experienced keep in mind every country that has a fractional reserve fiat monetary system is in the same boat as the united states the big difference is the dollar despite all the recent scurrying for the exits is still the reserve currency that will change however and then people will finally realize that the real question that needed asking was not if the fed could go broke but could the fed become irrelevant as we enter 2019 the answer to that questions appears to be a resounding yes graham mehl is a pseudonym he is not an insider he is required to use a pseudonym by the policies of his firm when releasing

cautionary note to u s investors this news release includes mineral reserves and mineral resources classification terms that comply with reporting standards in canada and the mineral reserves and the mineral resources estimates are made in accordance with ni 43 101 ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects these standards differ significantly from the requirements of the sec set out in sec industry guide 7 consequently mineral reserves and mineral resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic u s reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec under sec standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made in addition the sec s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by u s standards in documents filed with the sec u s investors should understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility moreover the requirements of ni 43 101 for identification of reserves are also not the same as those of the sec and reserves reported by us in compliance with ni 43 101 may not qualify as reserves under sec standards accordingly information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance

the global economic order has been threatened like never before and because of that global growth won t crack 3 this year according to a t kearney s 2019 2023 global economic outlook report titled on thin ice released on tuesday shifting supply chains out of china promises to be disruptive but won t do much to stop asia from being the world s growth engine over the next five years higher tariffs on account of trump s trade war however will make those disruptions worse leading to declines in corporate profit margins lower growth is not only trump s fault however some of the deceleration is caused by the business cycle the u s will be in its tenth year of economic expansion starting june deceleration sometimes leads to more debt which in a higher interest rate environment could be problematic structural factors are also contributing to growth deceleration a t kearney report authors wrote demographics in china japan and europe in particular where the average age is now in the 40s means more retirees more retirees can be a strain on government pensions and state funded services like healthcare this is even more worrisome when there are not enough workers to be taxed at a rate sufficient to pay for those costs a t kearney warns that the trade war can undercut growth prospects throughout asia not just in china which faces the brunt of trump s tariffs the current truce between washington and beijing was set to expire in march but trump recently said they would need more time and should extend the ceasefire period a t kearney analysts said there was a lack of faith in the main multilateral institutions of global finance and economic order namely the world bank and the international monetary fund to improve confidence primarily among the masses moreover a general lack of connection between the ruling politicians and the populace has been most exemplified in brexit and the november 2016 surprise victory of trump over the globally preferred establishment candidate hillary clinton disdain for the imf world bank and business as usual in washington has been increasing since the 1990s in 1991 bill clinton was elected to the presidency thanks to the entrant of a wild card businessman ross perot who garnered around 19 of the popular vote even after dropping out of the race perot was critical of free trade deals like nafta fast forward to today and most voters across the political spectrum are more apt to be against those big trade deals than in favor also in the late 1990s activists targeted both the imf and world bank during their annual meeting in seattle the famous battle in seattle saw store windows smashed and tear gas fired into crowds of protesters who didn t trust either institution some 20 years ago a t kearney isn t forecasting a global recession anytime soon the outlook is just less positive than it was a year ago that s when the u s was still being fueled by a fresh bout of tax cuts none of that is expected in trump s last two years in office looking at the bigger picture the u s and indian economies did well heading into 2019 but china the eu led by germany and japan are stagnating the emerging markets are still expected to do better this year than last year with the one key exception being china russia brazil and india are all expected to grow their economies more in 2019 than in 2018 but a weaker germany and china lackluster growth in japan and a slowing u s economy have a t kearney forecasting global gdp growth at 2 9 and falling to 2 6 in 2023 will that be enough to keep the middle classes expanding it was the shrinking of the middle classes in europe and the u s that led to where were are today if the middle class only expands in asia where a t kearney suspects most of the future growth will be centered until 2023 and shrinks in the u s and western europe look for more of the same from anti establishment politics although the a t kearney report does not say this economic buckling in the old economic order which is still alive may require some serious political willpower to backstop the losses felt by middle and lower income citizens that may come at the cost of higher taxes down the road posing a greater challenge to anti order types who might see some of their biggest employers set up shop in lower tax nations
this article appears in the winter 2019 issue of the american prospect magazine subscribe here j d vance s hillbilly elegy has been on the new york times bestseller list for nearly two years and deservedly given how improbable the author s odyssey has been vance grew up with a drug addicted mom involved with an untold number of men in a world of broken marriages teen pregnancies alcoholism violence mistrust anger and fatalism he owes his life and survival to loving grandparents who taught him to value hard work and education after he graduated high school he went into the marine corps then to ohio state to yale for his law degree and on to silicon valley before moving back to columbus ohio where he wrote this memoir at age 31 the book is powerfully written and poignant and for a year i decided to give j d vance a pass it is important his story be told and respected the problem is that vance is wrong about the lessons we should take from his memoir liberals too are wrong to think they can do penance and better understand the trump voter if they read the book and conservatives are most certainly wrong to believe that this powerful personal story confirms their belief that poverty is invariably the result of bad personal choices and immune to any governmental solutions the book s cascading errors begin with its failure to appreciate how exceptional appalachian white history and culture actually are and how dangerous it is to equate vance s hillbillies with today s white working class yet that is the equation vance makes at the very beginning of his memoir you see i grew up poor in the rust belt in an ohio steel town that has been hemorrhaging jobs and hope for as long as i can remember vance s equation reinforces conservatives and president donald trump s mistaken conviction that coal mining and west virginia are the epicenter of america s working class life the pace of cascading errors grows with the classless and benign history vance presents one that erases from the appalachian landscape the powerful business actors who seized the timber and mineral rights fought the coal mining unions and created an economy of poverty outside companies had long since claimed the rights to the timber the land and the coal beneath it rendering the region s population all their resources owned by outsiders dependent on coal companies and shuttled into company towns expand al behrman ap photo the decline of the coal economy began well before vance was born employment in the coal mines stalled during the depression and crashed during the 1950s six decades before the current debate vance s story begins in breathitt county kentucky where between 1940 and 1960 one third of the population left along the hillbilly corridor which took people to chicago detroit and cincinnati but also to small riverbank industrial cities like middletown and hamilton that abut the great miami river wherever they went the migrants formed little kentuckys in the cities and towns of the industrial midwest including middletown where vance s family relocated but neither vance s family nor all the little kentuckys typify the midwestern working class that is the object of so much concern today they never did america s industrial infrastructure was built by and employed mostly catholic immigrants from ireland italy and eastern europe along with protestant immigrants from germany and scandinavia jews from russia s pale of settlement and chinese and japanese workers until the united states enacted chinese exclusion laws a more sweeping nativist law effectively ended immigration in 1924 during world war ii and the postwar boom america s industrial leaders found other sources of new workers recruiting southern blacks mexicans and appalachian whites on a massive scale from the poorest rural areas of north america vance s story pretty much ignores the working class battle to get its share of the pie and the racial turmoil riots and struggle for civil rights that would shape the politics of america s cities it bypasses how millions of white workers would enter america s middle class in the three decades after world war ii as the government invested in their education and subsidized their homeownership it misses how these workers legs were then kicked out from under them by foreign competition technology globalization and trade agreements like nafta that undercut american jobs indeed vance sympathizes with company executives who fought off unions writing i might have done the same remarkably his account makes no mention of the staggering loss of wealth homeownership and wages among working people in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which has been america s dominant reality during vance s entire adult life that is why his story gives you no insight into what is happening with the struggling white and nonwhite workers who populate the cities suburbs and smaller towns of the rust belt and they are struggling working class families are breaking down the opioid epidemic is unchecked the very lifespans of working class whites are shrinking but how much of this exceptional american problem is due as vance would have it to the attitudes and culture of the working class itself and how much is due to the loss of decently paid secure jobs and the failure of public policy to meet the needs of the modern working family vance shines his spotlight squarely on the destructive culture in families like his families that are a hub of misery vance s grandparents had married as teenagers and settled quickly in middletown because his grandfather got a good job at armco steel that enabled him to own a fairly big house in a part of the town with neighbors almost exclusively from back home the hillbillies were looked down on by those neighbors who were not comfortable with slaughtering chickens or toting guns quite so openly or the outbursts of drunken violence vance s grandparents felt guilty about leaving their kentucky home and routinely visited their extended families on weekends and holidays vance and his grandparents were always more comfortable there than in ohio that s one important difference between the midwest appalachian transplants and the other streams of migrants who came north to the cities during world wars i and ii the blacks who moved to chicago to flee a segregated south certainly didn t pine for or return to mississippi while extended family ties remained strong for african americans the culture of the black belt did not have the same kind of ongoing influence on chicago detroit and cleveland blacks that the culture of rural kentucky had on the white appalachian migrants that was the culture in which vance was raised his addict mother had a revolving door of men in her life she had violent fights with the kids was taken away handcuffed by the police and nearly got herself killed in an auto accident increasingly vance stayed with his grandparents they demanded he get good grades help grandma with her chores and get a job and he dutifully worked in a store and warehouse they believed in hard work and the american dream and made sure the kids had a stable place to live vance believes that a loving home accounts for everything good that follows for vance the world he was born into and from which his grandparents saved him is pessimistic and socially isolated he watched his neighbors abuse food stamps disability benefits and section 8 housing and he saw few of his friends from the warehouse willing to take more work even when the shifts were offered i have known many welfare queens he writes some were my neighbors and all were white what goes on in the lives of real people when the industrial economy goes south he continues is about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible it s about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it experience can be a difficult teacher and it taught me that this story of economic insecurity is at best incomplete maybe vance s hillbillies would not be helped by new and better job opportunities higher wages less outsourcing investment in building infrastructure expanded child tax credits and income supports housing vouchers nutrition programs unpolluted rivers and air consumer protections affordable child care paid family leave after bearing a child and universal health insurance before we assent to vance s indictment we d do well to try out such policies nonetheless nearly all the reviews of this powerful book with the exception of robert kuttner s in the prospect were sure it provided some insights for elites who needed a genteel way into these working class communities where trump had run up the score larry summers tweeted anyone who wants to understand trump s rise or american inequality should read it in the new yorker joshua rothman gave vance credit for putting the spotlight on family disintegration addiction and domestic violence in white working class communities and showing us how complex is the problem of poverty not surprisingly conservative reviewers loved the book it bolstered their conviction that almost no public policy can change life s trajectory writing in the federalist mark hemingway applauded vance s refusal to moralize or pretend there are pat solutions to the problems he and so many other people in his circumstances have faced conservatives applauded vance s assertion that problems of family faith and culture aren t like a rubik s cube and i don t think that solutions as most people understand them really exist conservatives couldn t have agreed more rothman s new yorker review pointed out that americans have had this discussion before debating whether poverty is rooted in culture and norms or a function of economic and social conditions that government can address in 1965 the moynihan report on urban black families set off a debate over whether poverty is determined mainly by culture or by economics a choice most scholars ultimately rejected concluding that both factors had entwined and equal power as events would have it i became a graduate student and professor in the midst of that debate and examined this very question i conducted surveys and in depth interviews in five poor neighborhoods including a poor appalachian community called belmont in hamilton ohio just a few miles down the great miami river from middletown at about the time one middletown resident vance s mother was entering her teenage years i also conducted similar research in three very different poor and black neighborhoods in detroit philadelphia and atlanta and in a mexican american neighborhood in san jose what i discovered was that belmont was the only community i studied where a culture of poverty played a major role in explaining attitudes and civic behavior there is an ascendant fatalism personal impotence limited time perspective disorganization and apathy that combine to suppress any collective political urge i wrote in politics and poverty a book i based on my dissertation vance s description of hillbilly culture was painfully accurate but it didn t extend to the other poor communities i studied it was very different from the dominant culture and attitudes in the poor black neighborhoods of atlanta philadelphia and detroit and poor mexican american neighborhoods of san jose and importantly it would be very different from the thinking and politics in the non appalachian rust belt white working class communities that i would study a decade later expand ap photo how did it happen that i researched and observed these neighborhoods between 1970 and 1973 when i did the fieldwork that led to my first book i grew up acutely conscious of race and the battle for civil rights when my family moved to washington d c for my father to take a job we lived in an all black neighborhood then a mostly jewish neighborhood before d c schools were required to integrate my junior class trip took us by bus across the south to new orleans where we witnessed separate water fountains and argued with our tour guide the summer before going away to college i worked at a factory with white workers from west virginia while blacks were segregated in the shipping department at night i volunteered at the naacp office on u street and watched martin luther king s speech at the lincoln memorial from the organizing tent that i ended up as a pollster was hardly foretold for my senior project as a government major at miami university in 1967 i conducted a mail survey with undergraduates and based on that i was hired the following summer before starting graduate school by mit professor ithiel de sola pool to analyze a survey on student housing using new technology that allowed you to produce cross tabulations on your desktop based on that and even more improbably i was hired by a private research firm in cambridge to lead a project that engaged with the poor themselves in a national evaluation of the war on poverty for the office of economic opportunity it included an innovative leadership survey in 100 poor neighborhoods and a survey of the poor themselves in five of them that ended up as my harvard phd thesis and first book i conducted this research in a period after the urban riots had convulsed most american cities and i was looking to see whether a more radical anti systemic black politics was now dominant rather than the culture of poverty implied in the work of edward banfield herbert gans and james q wilson all of whom i studied with at harvard in fact i was rooting for a more developed class consciousness given the half century of rural impoverishment mass migration to cities and industrialization that shaped these communities all these hypotheses perished before the diversity of political consciousness in these neighborhoods my hope for a developed class consciousness fared worst of all as black auto workers thanked ford for their pay which was equal to that paid white workers and kentuckians thanked champion paper for their parks but the very different consciousness and mostly empowering politics in the black and mexican american neighborhoods left the culture of poverty theory in disrepute as well however that culture was a very large part of the story in belmont near where vance grew up he just did not realize how exceptional it was by locating in belmont the kentucky migrants had moved into the neighborhood with some of the lowest priced housing in hamilton where chicken coops were converted into one room houses the better houses had enough land for a corn patch starting in world war ii the kentuckians had come for jobs at champion paper fisher body and beckett paper migration had stopped by 1970 as manufacturing employment began to decline throughout belmont one could hear barely a murmur of politics only 12 percent indicated membership in any organization the hamilton journal news found only one instance where the community had joined together toward a common cause the only visible organization was o tuck kentuckians in ohio providing entertainment and relief for flood and mine victims back home but few residents of belmont got involved one of the leaders of o tuck said what they have is in hand they don t try to build up anything the mayor was from kentucky and operated a store in belmont though he lived on hamilton s richer west side he may have had a house but his home was in harlan county once he made his fortune he went back home on trusting people in the neighborhood the belmont residents scored the lowest by far of those in the five communities i surveyed on the question of whether the wise person lives for today and lets tomorrow take care of itself they scored at least 20 points higher than any other neighborhood that is why the mayor took for granted how much they suspected him of corruption and how apathetic they were about it in san jose s mexican american community residents were among the most organizationally engaged 6 percent belonged to three organizations a level six times that in belmont these included mutual benefit societies electoral organizations political pressure and civil rights groups and government funded advisory groups one in five belonged to fractious organizations with very different views of how to relate to the anglo american mainstream the poor neighborhood of detroit s east side was a more stable community due partly to ford s ongoing presence and its history of recruiting blacks and giving them equal pay to whites its organizations and elected leaders were suspicious of the intentions of whites suspicious of city government and the unions and looked out for the community s interests the east side was the womb for black political careers a neighborhood in which three quarters of the adult population was registered 45 percent of whom voted in congressional elections and 50 percent in local ones no other community i studied came close to this level of political participation the funeral homes baptist churches and indigenous and independent black organizations advocated for black interests even within the united auto workers that was very different from the summerhill area of atlanta where black organizations and people lent support to the progressive business alliance that helped prod atlanta to offer a more accommodating response to civil rights than other southern cities there were few institutions and no ymca or political clubs in the neighborhood their voter turnout was modest but residents scored very high on receptivity to politics and their sense of personal efficacy expand david coates detroit news via ap photo north central philadelphia was characterized by its frenetic politics as i wrote at the time fully 22 percent in that poor neighborhood belonged to an organization the highest in the communities studied it had vital tenant and welfare rights organizations big churches and church sponsored social welfare programs a large naacp chapter and a model city program it had strong citywide party electoral organizations that delivered patronage for votes this poor community had high electoral turnout and scored highest on my receptivity to politics scale and what of the non appalachian white working class all the cities of the industrial midwest had been shaped by the influx of irish german scandinavian italian polish slavic and jewish immigrants they lived in largely homogenous neighborhoods usually working their way from the poorest and most crowded inner cities to the inner suburbs the triumph of the unions in manufacturing after world war ii allowed many to climb into the middle class in detroit america s fourth largest city in the first half of the 20th century catholic immigrants from ukraine poland hungary romania and italy as well as the slavic states worked in the auto plants they were passionately pro union and after violent strikes the united automobile workers won recognition by the big three auto companies by 1941 in the years between 1970 and 1985 these workers moved heavily to white suburbs most especially macomb county which became home to the reagan democrats poor people from kentucky tennessee and west virginia had begun moving to midwestern cities like detroit during the hiring frenzy of world war ii and kept coming until the early 1960s some moved into urban neighborhoods like briggs and corktown which had been home to prior waves of immigrants while others moved to nearby rural communities like taylor and hazel park which soon came to be called taylortucky and hazeltucky there s abundant contemporaneous evidence that the culture of these appalachian white communities was not only distinctive but viewed as distinctive by other ethnic and working class americans at the time their very migration had distinctive roots henry ford had bought coal mines in appalachia and recruited the appalachian whites to come to detroit because they were safe that is much less likely to join a union just as vance s grandfather appreciated armco steel his employer so in detroit many appalachian whites memorialized henry ford and since many viewed their work in detroit as seasonal or temporary they were content to accept lower wages and competed with uaw supporters for jobs in ford s factories before the uaw unionized the company in 1941 even thereafter they resisted putting down roots and continued sending money back to their families in kentucky commentators wrote about the detroit southerners like the hamilton southerners having their trucks jam packed to head back to kentucky when their shift ended expand michelle patterson lexington herald leader via ap photo in 1934 a wayne state university survey asked detroit residents what people in detroit are undesirable the respondents ranked poor southern whites hillbillies etc as the second most undesirable behind criminals who topped the list given detroit s fractious black white history it s notable that negroes ranked fourth everywhere they resided the southerners were marginalized with others labeling them as crackers white trash red neck and hillbillies terms that created very real cultural boundaries in briggs and corktown neighborhoods within a mile of downtown detroit many rented rooms in victorian era homes that had been converted into rooming houses others lived in overcrowded basements and garages about the same time that i was conducting interviews in hamilton similar interviews with detroit residents revealed an appalachian white community in the 1960s that was clannish and religious landlords reported the tenants always having plumbing problems residents were seen as rude and violent and like blacks were discriminated against in getting rentals or even being allowed inside bars a quarter century later when john hartigan interviewed the southern residents of the briggs neighborhood in 1992 and 1993 he found only a meager sense of solidarity in this white haven the hillbillies were renters in a city where most strived to be homeowners they struggled to find work and half lived in poverty the white underclass in briggs hartigan wrote lives side by side with somewhat more financially secure working class neighbors while vance and his reviewers readily equate hillbillies with the white working class detroit makes clear that that equation could not be more off base i conducted my research with the white working class reagan democrats in the detroit suburb of macomb county in the mid 1980s when vance was born the white working class i researched and wrote about believed in hard work being rewarded taking personal and family responsibility owning a home with a yard and being engaged in church civic groups and unions it welcomed government that balanced corporate power with initiatives that gave working people greater security opportunity and mobility the workers there benefited when government was supportive of unions and created a system of social insurance that allowed them to retire with security the next generation climbed up the social and economic ladder when all had access to education but some of their certitudes had begun to collapse in july 1967 detroit s inner city erupted into five days of rioting and looting that took 43 lives and required the national guard and u s paratroopers to reassert order detroit was the most segregated metropolitan area in the country and in 1971 a federal judge ordered the use of school busing to integrate the suburbs macomb was the center of the anti busing protests and organization george wallace got 67 percent of the democratic primary vote in macomb in 1972 and reagan won 66 percent of the macomb vote in 1984 against walter mondale the candidate of organized labor the world of the unionized detroit auto workers had begun to crumble unemployment rose above 15 percent in macomb county in march 1981 as the local industry contracted in the face of foreign competition and relocation to the non union south companies demanded givebacks of wages and benefits from the workers in their negotiations with the uaw as the workers in macomb saw it democrats seemed to care more about blacks in detroit and protesters on campus more about equal rights and abortions than about their ability to pay their mortgages or for their kids future robert f kennedy whom i worked for in 1968 advanced a formula to win both black and ethnic catholic voters but the formula died with him until bill clinton whom i also worked for resurrected it in his 1992 campaign clinton was embraced early by black voters in detroit and elsewhere in the primary and nearly won macomb s white voters in the general he attacked the 1980s as a gilded age of greed selfishness irresponsibility excess and neglect and said i want the jetsetters and featherbedders of corporate america to know that if you sell your companies and your workers and your country down the river you ll get called on the carpet all the while millions of decent ordinary people who worked hard played by the rules and took responsibility for their own actions were falling behind clinton declared those at the top must pay their fair share of taxes but also that hardworking americans were right to be upset about welfare when clinton announced his candidacy for president he promised to end welfare as we know it that meant new work requirements but also major government initiatives to make work pay including big investments in education a higher minimum wage a greatly expanded earned income tax credit and health insurance for all clinton s offer was both responsibility and opportunity and that is what both white and black working people wanted and voted for in 1992 both groups were dealing with the accelerating retrenchment of manufacturing jobs from 1970 to the 1990s the crisis only deepened after congress ratified the north american free trade agreement nafta in 1993 and established permanent normal trade relations with china in 2000 both supported by clinton the united states had lost 1 5 million manufacturing jobs during the decade of the 1980s when many of these voters turned to reagan but in the quarter century since nafta took effect a further 4 5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost including 182 288 in michigan when macomb county voters were deciding whether to support barack obama in the summer of 2008 he never brought up detroit or black people and he wasn t running on black issues as jesse jackson had in 1984 my surveys showed that only one third of macomb residents thought obama would put the interests of blacks ahead of other americans and only a small minority believed affirmative action and blacks not taking responsibility posed a threat to the middle class by contrast they were nearly venomous in their critique of corporate ceos politicians and elites of both parties who promoted global trade at the expense of american jobs by a large majority they said that outsourcing of jobs to other countries and nafta and international trade agreements were the biggest economic problems they embraced the message that the middle class today is threatened by global trade ceos who care more about their companies than their own country and politicians who support free trade agreements backed by corporate special interests the financial crisis of 2008 and the great recession took a huge and enduring toll on working people black and white but so did policies that benefited the elites and did little or nothing for working americans bonuses for bailed out bankers none of whom went to jail continued to be paid while home foreclosures continued unabated middle income hispanic and black households lost more than 40 percent of their wealth the new jobs after the crash paid 17 percent less than the ones that had been lost and median income did not return to its pre crash level for an entire decade today we worry about the deaths of despair the suicide rate the breakdown of marriage and the spread of drugs throughout much of white working class america middle size cities and small towns have lost big companies stores and new investment many white residents in those terrains expressed their anger at the political and economic elites by voting for donald trump when conservatives and republican leaders think about these abandoned and beleaguered white workers they see people who have grown dependent on government for whom the war on poverty unemployment and disability benefits food stamps housing vouchers and medicaid have all failed to address their problems paul ryan has termed these policies a hammock that allows people to comfortably drop out of the labor market vance s book suggests a dysfunctional culture has left these people and communities disabled and our medicine cabinet of governmental remedies empty the problem with those judgments is that you have to erase a lot of history and a lot of experience with policy outcomes to get there working class families and communities are indeed in trouble but a lot of factors contributed to it the culprit was not bad choices it was not lack of personal responsibility or a government that was clueless about how to get to a better economy and society we are not powerless to address these ills with the full republican takeover of the u s government in 2016 however the gop got the opportunity to address the problems facing the white working class that had played such a big role in donald trump s victory in response republicans devoted 2018 to building in work requirements before the able bodied could receive welfare benefits food stamps or be covered by medicaid they paid no attention to the evidence that prior imposition of work requirements had no long term effect on the poverty rate or on people staying in the labor force they ignored the fact that half of snaprecipients worked when they got food stamps and three quarters worked in the year afterward they ignored that most of the beneficiaries are children and the reason conservatives have embraced work requirements is to keep lower income and working class americans from becoming indolent an idiocy with the cruelest of consequences they d learned or relearned from vance is that really all they have to offer working people what an insult the republicans lost dramatically in the anti trump wave election of 2018 but most of all they lost across the industrial midwest and rust belt stretching from pennsylvania to michigan and wisconsin to kansas compared with the 2016 vote republicans faced some of their biggest losses among white working class men and women working people showed they had wearied of republicans anti government slogans and that they didn t believe that food stamps and medicaid led to people swinging idly in hammocks voters have stripped republicans of their congressional majority paul ryan has retired to his hammock and republicans would do well to unlearn the lessons of hillbilly elegy
reading time 4 minutes the current situation cannot continue the news of oil sinking to around 60 dollars per barrel combined with venezuela s large fiscal deficit and deteriorating economy makes the country s annual 8 billion oil subsidy to petrocaribe nations increasingly unsustainable the question is what will replace it fortunately the 17 member countries of petrocaribe don t have to look far to find a viable alternative aruba s successful energy policies have demonstrated that life without petrocaribe is possible aruba s government resisted the temptation to join petrocaribe instead it planned to achieve a zero carbon footprint and energy independence exclusively using renewable sources by 2020 driven by public private partnerships like those with arizona state university asu and byd company ltd aruba is using byd green technologies to electrify public transportation and is transitioning its energy generation platform to incorporate wind and solar resources for example by doubling its wind farms and installing solar panels on school buildings it is also making its energy storage systems more sustainable by updating the grid system and connecting it to the generation chain as part of a sustainability education partnership asu held two professional workshops on systems design and installation of photovoltaic resources small scale liquified natural gas lng plants or low sulfur coal could also be viable alternatives but aruba s solar and wind based model provides the caribbean with the most sustainable long term energy platform capable of replacing petrocaribe the good news for aruba is that by foregoing venezuelan patronage the country has established the foundation for sustainable long term growth meanwhile for petrocaribe members the incentives for developing sustainable alternatives have been depressed by bolivarian largesse but renewable energy while important can t provide the full answer for countries post petrocaribe especially in the short term fully exploiting renewable energy sources will require restructuring the current model of regional cooperation that in turn will require the involvement of north american free trade agreement nafta member states canada the u s and mexico and their engagement in providing access to more sustainable energy sources beyond the sheer fiscal irresponsibility of petrocaribe as an enterprise economic pressures are mounting for venezuela to curtail its shipments to the caribbean venezuelan oil production has fallen and a series of loan deals between china and venezuela at very favorable terms to china has meant that venezuela has to divert an increasing share of its petroleum exports to china to pay its debts the flip side of the coin is equally troubling the cost of petrocaribe s petroleum imports represents according to the royal bank of canada on average between 7 and 12 percent of the participating countries gdps yet in spite of this massive subsidy economic growth in the caribbean remains fragile all the participating countries except suriname are running a balance of payments deficit despite only having to make a percentage of the payment up front about 50 percent of the cost when oil prices are between 51 and 100 per barrel the balance being payable as a loan with 25 years maturity at 1 percent interest per year provided oil prices are above 40 per barrel some even have the privilege of being able to pay off the loan with products instead of cash as of 2012 the principal debtors are the dominican republic 11 billion jamaica 7 billion and the bahamas 3 billion together with nicaragua they represent the bulk of the 12 billion owed by petrocaribe members which venezuela is unlikely to recover for decades indeed venezuela recently sold part of its dominican republic petrocaribe debt to goldman sachs at a 60 percent discount not only have these countries staved off economic crisis by becoming addicted to cheap oil they have dug themselves into a credit hole the question of what will happen when venezuela pulls the plug and the entire system collapses has become a regional concern the answer may lie to the west and north since the start of petrocaribe the u s has become a net energy exporter canada has increased production and mexico is expected to follow suit following recent energy reforms with the uptick in production the nafta states have a unique opportunity to revamp the hemisphere s energy production and supply chains indeed u s vice president joe biden announced this year the caribbean energy security initiative involving a portfolio of programs to help transform the electricity sector the first step of a potential new cooperation plan involving regional energy exporting countries would be to move beneficiary nations out of petrocaribe s unsustainable and risky subsidy system a more rational model would resemble the san josé agreement the 1980 precursor to petrocaribe under that arrangement discounted or subsidized venezuelan oil exports required the beneficiary countries to import engineering services from venezuelan companies to build infrastructure or to purchase venezuelan manufactured goods in an updated model energy savings from the discounted or subsidized oil would be invested in joint ventures with the private sector from the cooperating countries venezuela and the recipient to develop alternative energy sources and infrastructure the second step is two pronged to resolve its financial problem venezuela would have to almost entirely refinance the debt accumulated by petrocaribe beneficiaries that would mean exploring available alternative energy sources one option is to build power plants fueled by lng by ethane or propane gas from the u s or by low sulfur colombian coal trinidad and tobago has plentiful gas resources and an lng plant that sends some supplies to puerto rico and the dominican republic but scaling this up requires pipelines which in addition to representing a huge financial commitment do not facilitate a bridge to renewable energy platforms the kind of small scale lng plants pursued in jamaica may be a better answer in terms of alternative but non renewable energy sources with sustainable cooperation caribbean nations can not only free themselves from oil dependence but also escape the subsidy and debt cycle that petrocaribe created by cushioning the blow of the collapse of easy cheap oil nafta countries can help lay the groundwork and incentives for the construction of a more sustainable healthy renewable energy system in the caribbean
in her book economic philosophy first published in 1962 eminent cambridge economist joan robinson called economics partly a vehicle for the dominant ideology of the period and partly a method of scientific investigation the neoliberal version of capitalism has been the dominant ideology for the last four decades governments not markets fail therefore governments should be limited in their economic ambitions market prices not elected representatives should allocate resources under neoliberalism a government s main role is to assist business investors to provide employment incomes and prosperity urged on by economists governments have cut tax rates for wealthy individuals and businesses and granted income from investment a more favourable treatment than salary and wage income a core belief of neoliberal capitalists is that government budgets must be balanced to prevent the accumulation of public debt government borrowing is discouraged because it crowds out private investment and drives up interest rates for corporations in his recent presidential address to the american economics association olivier blanchard a former chief economist of the international monetary fund imf questioned the idea that public debt was necessarily bad pointing to the low interest rates prevailing in the u s blanchard argued that as long as the rate of economic growth is greater than the rate of interest on u s treasury bills the capacity to grow the economy outstrips the growth of public debt why think there is such a thing as the burden of the debt when as blanchard argues economic growth allows debt to be paid down blanchard cites economists brad delong and lawrence summers whose research shows that increased government spending grew the economy faster covering the cost of borrowing money to finance the spending rather than thinking of debt as a charge on future generations something to be paid forever blanchard points out that in a low interest environment governments roll over debt and are able to undertake new borrowing to replace the debt being retired thanks to economic growth while economists have taught that government borrowing lowers overall welfare blanchard argues that welfare benefits outweigh costs the key of course is for governments to make wise investments with the borrowed money in that respect blanchard could have pointed to the bloated u s warfare state and its huge cost in foregone social expenditures under blanchard s direction the imf produced research that showed the failings of fiscal austerity programs promoted by the imf itself in the wake of the great financial crisis of 2007 2008 in an updated assessment the imf concluded that government spending had a far greater impact on employment creation than its economic model had projected blanchard a french citizen suggested in an interview with la croix that capitalist ideology itself must be questioned notably the commitment to free circulation of capital worldwide and to free trade while he supports increases in minimum wages and inheritance taxes blanchard no radical also encourages subsidizing market wages and keeping taxes on wealth low in his presidential address blanchard by using the scientific method of economics to question the current dominant ideology has brought together the two parts of economics identified by joan robinson his research won t be enough to convince american republicans or canadian conservative party leader andrew scheer who rant about too much government spending to change their minds but blanchard has another objective to make the american economics association membership rethink its support for neoliberal thinking about public debt duncan cameron is president emeritus of rabble ca and writes a weekly column on politics and current affairs photo international monetary fund flickr help make rabble sustainable please consider supporting our work with a monthly donation support rabble ca today for as little as 1 per month

stelling kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thank you steve and good morning to everyone welcome to our third fourth quarter earnings call i m joined this morning by our synovus leadership team as usual i ll walk through the earnings presentation and will open the line for questions i ll start with the earnings deck on slide 3 which provides a summary of our fourth quarter results diluted eps was 0 87 for the quarter on an adjusted basis diluted eps was 0 92 down 3 1 from the previous quarter and up 28 1 from the same period a year ago the adjustments this quarter to reported eps are largely due to merger related expenses the 3 4 million associated with the florida community bank merger and a 1 6 million decrease in the fair value of private equity investments net of tax fourth quarter results were positively impacted by a broad based loan growth strong growth in deposits due in part to seasonal inflows of state county and municipal deposits and an additional 3 basis points of margin expansion however these benefits were offset by higher effective tax rate during the quarter due primarily to refinements of year end provision estimates for the full year our effective tax rate was 21 7 in line with the revised range we provided last quarter return on average assets during the quarter was 1 29 on a reported basis on an adjusted basis return on average assets was 1 36 down 11 basis points sequentially and up 24 basis points from a year ago total adjusted revenues increased 8 5 versus the same period last year while adjusted expenses increased 2 5 though we experienced a slight increase in our expense run rate due to seasonality in the fourth quarter we remain very focused on managing expenses in line with our objective to maintain strong positive operating leverage on the balance sheet side average loans for the quarter grew 303 7 million or 4 8 sequentially and just over 1 billion or 4 1 versus a year ago on the other side of the balance sheet average deposits grew 532 8 million or 8 sequentially and 634 million or 2 4 versus a year ago total deposits in the prior year prior quarter were elevated due to broker deposits received as part of the transaction with cabela s and world s foremost bank we continue to benefit from a relatively stable credit environment with a nonperforming assets ratio improving further to 0 44 a 2 basis point improvement from the previous quarter and a 9 basis point improvement from a year ago lastly in terms of capital management and returns we continue to see improvement in overall capital efficiency with an adjusted roe of 14 99 up 303 basis points from a year ago adjusted return on average tangible common equity improved to 15 36 up 310 basis points from a year ago moving to slide 4 total loans of 26 billion grew 369 5 million sequentially or 5 7 annualized and 4 7 from a year ago we were pleased to see steady loan growth again this quarter with c i up 278 million and consumer loans up 240 million somewhat offset by commercial real estate loans which declined 148 million declines in the cre were spread across multi family shopping center hotel and non strategic land and development portfolios c i loan growth was driven primarily by our general commercial banking teams across the footprint and was aided somewhat by seasonal growth and line utilization additionally our interest premium finance business global one grew 80 million during the fourth quarter and our asset based lending vertical grew 41 million similar to last quarter our consumer portfolio experienced growth across all categories including mortgage heloc lending partnerships and credit card from a geographic standpoint our metro markets continue to drive a large share of overall loan growth total average loans grew 304 million sequentially compared to the same quarter a year ago average loans grew 1 01 billion or 4 1 we continue to be pleased with the balanced loan composition and diversification of our balance sheet c i loans now represent 49 of total loans with consumer loans increasing to 26 of the portfolio while cre loans have now declined to 25 of outstanding balances we continue to be selective in our approach to cre monitoring our markets and asset classes very closely and maintaining very strong discipline around price and structure moving to slide 5 and deposits total average deposits of 26 92 billion increased 533 million sequentially and have increased 634 million or 2 4 versus a year ago as i mentioned earlier the year over year growth was muted due to the expected decline in broker deposits that were acquired in the fourth quarter 2017 in a transaction with world s foremost bank today just under 400 million or one third of the original 1 1 billion broker deposits associated with world s foremost bank had matured as a result average broker deposits declined to just 6 of total deposits in the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding broker deposits average deposits increased 681 million versus the third quarter of 2018 with strong growth in non interest bearing deposits up 342 8 million from the prior quarter as well as 114 billion growth in money market accounts and 205 million in time deposits while a significant portion of the growth in non interest bearing deposits were due to seasonal state county municipal inflows growth in other non interest bearing continues to be strong resulting from account growth as well as balance augmentation as expected we experienced seasonal inflows of state and county municipal deposits during the quarter of approximately 313 million we expect these deposits will return to more normalized levels during the first quarter of 2019 moving to slide 6 net interest income was 298 million increasing 6 3 million or 2 2 versus the previous quarter compared to the same period a year ago net interest income increased 28 million or 10 5 the net interest margin for the quarter was 3 92 up an other 3 basis points from the previous quarter and up 27 basis points from a year ago the net interest margin improvement for the quarter was driven by 12 basis point increase in loan yields due to the september and december short term rate hikes and resulting higher average libor rate the increase in cost of funds during the fourth quarter was consistent with the third quarter as the effective cost of funds increased 8 basis points sequentially to 81 basis points and the cost of interest bearing deposits increased 14 basis points this quarter deposit betas actually declined this quarter with an incremental interest bearing deposit beta of 52 compared to 67 last quarter additionally our cycle to date beta of only 23 continues to demonstrate the value of our strong core deposit franchise turning to slide 7 and fee income total non interest income for the quarter was 68 million down 3 7 million versus the prior quarter and 1 4 million versus the same period a year ago as i mentioned earlier non interest income in the quarter included a decrease in the fair value of private equity investments of 2 1 million adjusted non interest income of 70 1 million decreased 1 2 million versus prior quarter and increased 822 000 or 1 2 versus the same period a year ago core banking fees of 36 8 million increased 1 1 million sequentially and were up 1 2 million or 3 5 compared to the prior year period the improvement in core banking fees quarter over quarter was largely due to better card fee income as well as sba gains on sale fiduciary asset management brokerage and interest revenues of 24 6 million increased slightly on a sequential basis and increased 2 8 million or 13 from a year ago assets under management declined in the fourth quarter due to the decline in equity markets but due to account growth is up slightly versus the same period last year that said for the full year revenues associated with these businesses increased 13 7 through our focused talent expansion efforts and we look forward to continued progress on these goals in 2019 mortgage revenues of 3 8 million were somewhat soft in the fourth quarter declining 1 5 million sequentially as result of lower secondary market production which was due to seasonality and continued pressure on refinance activity turning to slide 8 total non interest expense of 209 9 million decreased 10 4 million or 4 7 sequentially and decreased 16 6 million or 7 3 versus the same period a year ago the year over year decline as a result of a 23 million pre tax loss from early redemption of senior notes that was incurred in the fourth quarter last year is part of our balance sheet restructuring actions undertaken related to the cabela s transaction also as i noted earlier the current quarter included fcb merger related expenses of 3 4 million adjusted non interest expense of 206 1 million increased 4 5 million or 2 2 sequentially and increased 5 million or 2 5 from a year ago the sequential increase in expenses is a result of a 3 1 million increase in advertising expenses which were seasonally lower in the previous quarter and a 3 million increase in consulting fees incurred as we prepared to launch our new consumer online and mobile platform known as my synovus in the first quarter we re very excited about that these increases were partially offset by a 1 7 million reduction in fdic expense resulting from elimination of the dif surcharge we re pleased this year technical difficulty which was 55 98 in the fourth quarter and 56 33 for the full year improving 354 basis points from 2017 and exceeding our long term target of 57 turning to slide 9 you ll see continued excellent performance on our credit quality measures the npa and npl ratios both improved declining to 44 basis points and 41 basis points respectively past due to greater than 30 days decline at 22 points while past due is greater than 90 days were 1 basis point net charge offs ended the quarter at 20 basis points for the full year charge offs also came in at 20 basis points which was right in the middle of our stated range of 15 to 25 basis points the allowance for loan losses decline to modest 900 000 from the previous quarter with the ratio ending at 97 basis points down 1 basis point from the third quarter however the coverage ratios of reserve to npl remained strong improving slightly from the previous quarter to 235 or 298 excluding impaired loans for which the expected reserve has been charged off before i lead to credit slide i want to take a couple of minutes to reflect on the significant progress our company has made over the past few years as we have completely rebuilt our balance sheet structure and greatly strengthened our credit profile and reiterate our commitment to this conservative approach to credit as we move into a more uncertain 2019 post crisis the cre book has declined from 46 to 25 total loans with c i increasing to 49 and consumer increasing to 26 in addition to reducing our cre exposure significantly the mix within cre has shifted with investment properties now comprising 85 of the cre portfolio these loans have been originated under a conservative underwriting policy with appropriate loan to value and debt service requirements in place for each property type residential c d and land which once comprise almost 25 of the entire loan book now comprises only 1 7 of total loans this is now considered a non strategic portfolio with only a small volume of non speculative loans made to well established homebuilders under very strict underwriting guidelines we adhere a very comprehensive concentration policy where we limit our exposure to any asset class or individual borrower our appetite for each property type and industry is determined by senior credit leadership based on real time market intelligence and approve by our board level risk committee additionally we rigorously stress test our portfolio and results showing that even a severely adverse economic scenario would result in significantly lower credit losses than during the last recession with capital level remaining adequate throughout the period this is a direct result of our efforts since the last recession to restructure and derisk the balance sheet as i said earlier while the future economic outlook is less certain we believe we re well positioned from a credit quality standpoint regardless of the timing or the severity of the next downturn moving on to slide 10 to talk about capital where you ll see our ratios generally improved for the quarter all ratios remain well in excess of regulatory minimums and are at the upper end of our internal operating ranges our cet1 ratio increased to 10 04 during the quarter in december we announced an additional common share repurchase authorization of 25 million that was completed in the same month together with a 150 million our authorization announced in the first quarter of 2018 and completed in october our total common share repurchases in 2018 were 175 million this resulted in a reduction of 3 7 million shares a 3 1 reduction in our share count in the aggregate we returned 281 million to common shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends in 2018 just to give you a quick summary of the year slide 11 highlights a number of key metrics this show the broad based financial improvement that our team achieved in 2018 so i ll hit those very quickly generally our financial results were in line with our 2018 guidance we re well ahead of the long term targets for eps growth roa rotce and the adjusted efficiency ratio that we established just a year ago for the full year adjusted eps grew 43 8 adjusted roa improved to 1 41 return on average tangible common equity improved to 15 66 and the adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 56 33 additionally we achieve further growth and diversification of our balance sheet we maintain strong credit quality we enhanced our capital position and executing on a truly strategic merger with fcb that broadens our reach into one of the most compelling markets in the southeast in short our team delivered on our objectives in 2018 and we have a high degree of confidence as we move into 2019 before i give a brief merger update i d like to take just a minute and give an overview of fcb s fourth quarter financial performance with a summary of those results provided on slide 18 of the appendix we saw continued strong fundamental performance for the quarter with net income of 41 8 million and eps of 0 87 a share down 0 02 versus the third quarter primarily due to increased provision loan growth was sound during the quarter with average due loan growth of over 300 million during the quarter compared to loan growth lower due to elevated cre pay offs late in the quarter efficiency of operations continue to be a point of emphasis with non interest expense of third technical difficulty declining 4 1 million in the third quarter resulting in an efficiency ratio of 36 22 core down was 3 15 compared to 3 18 to prior quarter as a yield on earning assets increased 11 basis points while the effective cost of funds increased 14 basis points we continue to be very pleased with the quality of the loan portfolio the quarter did include 10 7 million in provision expense associated with the charge off of a syndicated c i loan which fcb had previously identified the loan was incorporated into our due diligence process as it was on non accrual status during our review the charge off this quarter represents for the migration on the credit we believe this fully covers the exposure this one off credit does not represent a systemic pattern as we ve stated before syndications represent about 3 of the fcb total loan portfolio the overall credit metrics continue to be strong with npa is of 25 basis points npls at 11 basis points and 60 day delinquency also at 11 basis points and with the aforementioned charge off net charge offs were only 14 basis points for the year kevin howard will give a little more color on credit for the combined company later on but again we ve been very pleased both with the performance of the existing book of fcb and certainly the loans we ve seen originated since we ve begun our association and kevin again will cover more on that later so we ve mentioned the fcb integration a number of times but before we talk about our 2019 outlook i wanted to just offer a few comments about the success of our legal day 1 conversion and why we re so confident as we prepare for the full conversion of our systems and branding by mid 2019 we were very pleased with the efficiency of the regulatory approval process and our own internal planning and organization which allowed us to close on january 1 2019 just 161 days after announcing the transaction our top priority in preparing to legal day 1 was carrying for the fcb team members and their customers we took important steps early in the process to assess talent and offer competitive packages for those we wanted to retain we also began introducing our culture we regularly share information and offer training that enable a smooth transition into our team on day 1 we re very pleased with the employee retention rate to date while also remaining aligned with our efficiency targets including headcount related expect savings we now expect merger related cost savings in 2019 to exceed 25 million well ahead of our original 2019 estimate of 20 million we we re also pleased with customer outrage and response so far on both account attrition and call volume into our customer care center have been low and we continue to equip our florida team to confidently promote the long term customer benefits of our combined bank to actively promote our brand in that region through multiple channels and to take steps to enhance the customer experience during the transition finally as we prepared for legal day 1 we were already planning for full brand and systems conversion which we expect to complete by mid year the timeline on the slide provides a very high level view of key activities and when they occur over the coming months our team is energized around the even more complex work ahead ready to move us to the next several months so we re able to fully execute as one team serving customers in our newest high growth markets movie to slide 13 and beginning to look forward you ll see that these five key opportunities we ve outlined for 2019 are in some ways very similar to those that enable our company to generate significant financial improvement over the last few years the mid single digit growth profile we ve demonstrated historically will be enhanced by fcb strong middle market banking award culture that has characterized both institutions in addition to growing our balance sheet interest income our expanded talent base and wealth management insurance and brokerage will further work to diversify our sources of revenue which makes our business more resilient over the long term the work we ve done to rebuild our consumer product offering will be invaluable in deepening our share of wallet with existing customers and acquiring new ones as we grow revenue ongoing rationalization of our core expense base is just a way right this will continue to be the case in 2019 and just as we have in the last few years you should expect to see us maintain positive operating leverage of 1 5 to 2 times as these financial results are delivered our expected earnings and capital optimization actions in 2019 will lead to an outsized opportunity to return excess capital to our shareholders and now that we ve completed the first phase of the merger we can begin to deliver on the cost savings associated with the acquisition again expected to exceed 25 million in the first year more importantly though we re eager to leverage the complementary strengths of our platforms and begin generating revenue synergies by deploying a best in class set of products services and capabilities to our collective customers so with that backdrop i d like to take you to slide 14 which will give you a view into our 2019 guidance then i ll talk more specifically about our capital plans and how we anticipate these results tying into these long range objectives we expect 2019 to be another solid year from a balance sheet perspective we expect loan and deposit growth of 5 5 to 7 5 on a period end basis with deposits beta supports our loan growth while maintaining an appropriate loan to deposit ratio consistent with under its operating range of 95 to 97 this expected growth is measure off of a pro forma combined baseline of 35 37 billion in loans and 37 6 billion on deposits based on preliminary consolidation of both balance sheets we also expect revenue growth of 5 5 to 7 5 2019 in line with our balance sheet growth expectation this outlook assumes no short term rate hikes in 2019 and we expect the post merger adjusted nim to compress slightly as a result of the flatness of the current yield curve in our plans to optimize the capital stack we also expect adjusted non interest expense in the range of 2 to 4 net of synergies tied with the fcb acquisition as i indicated earlier we fully expect to manage ongoing expenses in a prudent way while also realizing merger cost savings in an accelerated manner throughout the year our effective tax rate is expected to be 23 to 24 and we anticipate a net charge off ratio of 15 to 20 basis points which incorporates the impact of large acquired loan portfolio as well as an expectation of slight normalization of charge offs in 2019 relative to the historically low levels in 2018 and finally our capital actions for 2019 will include a 20 increase in our common dividend to a 1 20 per share and expected share repurchase of 300 million to 350 million which we largely supported by capital optimization strategies including expected capacity to issue tier 2 instruments on slide 15 you ll see some additional detail related to the 2019 capital actions i just mentioned which collectively are expected to return approximately 500 million to common shareholders over the next four quarters i ll walk through the components of this plan which include both the larger common dividend and an increase in common share repurchases as we ve shared many times before our capital prioritization strategy always begins with funding organic growth and investing an appropriate level of capital back into the business followed by pursuit of competitive dividend optimizing the capital stack and then finally evaluating the risk return trade off between share repurchase and m a we re pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a 20 increase in the common stock dividend for 2019 to 0 30 per share with a quarterly dividend payable effective with the dividend payable in april of 2019 as a result of our higher share count after the issuance of stock to acquire fcb the dollar in fact on an annual basis associated with the dividend is 190 million to 200 million including the current increase the dividend growth for synovus has been 30 on a compounded basis since 2014 in 2019 we ll also have an opportunity to optimize combined capital base of synovus after merging with fcb the chart at bottom left of the slide reflects our pro forma capital ratios post merger and reveals that one of our total risk based capital ratio will begin the year near the low end of our operating range we would have the capacity in our other capital ratios to issue 300 million to 350 million of tier 2 qualifying instruments for the purpose of repurchasing common stock while remaining well within our desired operating range on slide 16 as we ve said over the last few months that we provide updated long term targets having exceeded or on track to exceed all of our previously stated goals included 20 compounded eps growth to 1 35 roa 15 return on tangible to common equity and an adjusted efficiency ratio below 57 further by enhancing our growth and profitability profile for the merger with fcb we believe we re on track to deliver top quartile financial performance so we re resetting our long term targets accordingly as you ll see on slide 16 our team has defined key areas of focus around which we re building core strategies that will enhance the customer experience and solidify our value proposition of course by doing so we ll continually elevate our financial performance in the key areas of growth profitability and efficiency over the three year time horizon we ve divined from meeting these targets we believe will reach in our way at 1 45 and rotce of 17 and maintain a tangible efficiency ratio of around 50 so before we open the line for questions i just want to reiterate how proud i m of our combined teams for their contributions to a landmark 2018 a year that included a historic transition to a single brand among other milestone accomplishments as evidenced the priorities and opportunities we outlined during our call today you can see 2019 is already fast and furiously under way for our team we re very aware of the challenges ahead but that s really when our team is at its best as we ve demonstrated time and time again in addition to our intense focus on successfully completing the fcb integration and launching our new my synovus digital banking experience through the first half of the year our team is also aggressively positioning talent building synergies through our new go to market delivery model announced late last year as you ve already heard our new chief operating officer is kevin blair and under his model we ll combine our revenue generating businesses our technology and operations team for what we will believe will be much better alignment and execution of our growth strategy kevin and his team which includes kevin howard who as you know is transitioning out of his role as chief credit officer to lead our newly combined wholesale bank team wayne akins who s expanding his role from retail executive to chief community banking officer leading a combined retail community bank team bart singleton who continues serving as our financial management services president and and evp and zack bishop new to our team our it and operations executive all of whom who have made significant changes and reporting and named key talent to new or expanded roles in organization we re very excited about the way this team is going to market you ll hear again from kevin today in his last official day as i spoke to before our credit team and we ll have a search as we have said before under way today for a new cfo we really do believe this new models in a foster more full effective approach we re tracking way new business especially as we integrate the newest florida team members into our relationship centered sales and service culture and then finally as kevin kevin howard transitions with his new role we announced just yesterday bob derrick is our new chief credit officer bob with us today we won t have him speaking on the call we re really excited about bob and his role he is not new to credit he s not new to our company he s got more than 15 years in various credit supervision roles within synovus most recently as chief credit officer of the entire community bank bob s very natural choice to see kevin howard we appreciate his willingness to relocate to our headquarters here in columbus and to lead this critical function for our company again as i mentioned earlier we have an active search under way for our new cfo we believe we ll have that talent in place soon with that we look forward to reporting our progress to you throughout the year thank you for continued interest in our company operator we ll now open the floor to questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question today comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst great good morning kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer good morning ken ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst so i ll just start off on the buyback so obviously it s good to see the higher buyback amount could you just talk a little bit about the timing of how those the 300 million to 350 million could progress in terms of the buybacks over the course of the year but also throw in the tier 2 debt do you need to is it going to be a 1 1 issuance and what s the timing of when that might be issued thanks kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer okay so ken obviously the way in which we look at share repurchases they re situational based on the stock price our liquidity position the level of organic growth so you may want to model share repurchases happening across the entire 4 quarters but as it relates to the tier 2 issuance or the potential tier 2 issuance we re constantly looking at the markets to understand when they re constructive i would suggest that we would look to do if we were to go to market we would look at benchmark type transactions so you could look at a site that would be fairly correlated to the level of share repurchase but again it s hard to foreshadow when that opportunity would arise based on the markets and how constructive and what pricing we would receive on those instruments so not a specific answer we re in we re constantly looking at the markets and we re evaluating what s opportunistic for synovus and that s when we would go to market with any transaction ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got it understood okay and then just second question in terms of the fcb cost savings and in terms of the 25 million does most of that get realized after the full systems conversion in sort of second half of the year or could any of that be front loaded kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer some of it will be frontloaded as we get some expense saves upfront with certain personnel that we re able to get some savings from the reduction in the workforce there will be additional personnel savings as we go through the rest of the year but there are other items like contracts and one time expenses that would be reduced in the first half of the year so it s largely spread across the year ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst all right great perfect thank you very much kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks ken operator the next question comes from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari evercore analyst good morning guys kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning john john pancari evercore analyst if you could just give me give us a little bit more color on the fcb credit that you flagged kessel mainly just around the why they have confidence that it s not a one off or that it is a one off and not indicative of a trend what are they looking at that gives them that confidence and also could you just remind us of the size in the industry of the credit thanks kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer yes i ll let kevin delve into more detail there john but i ll just say as i said syndication s a very small part of their book it s a nonorganic piece of their book less 3 or less again this particular credit was identified by them and moved to nonperforming i don t know the exact timing but certainly when we did our due diligence it was already classified so this was not a surprise to them or to us and it s just in those nationally syndicated credits where we ve got a lot of banks there s just a process you go through but kevin let me not to steal your thunder i ll let you add anything else you want to kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer yes kessel pretty much covered that but i would just say this there were the reason we feel it s not a systemic issue again 14 other banks involved their exposure was around 15 million 16 million it was again in the syndication book i think there s just a handful of those credits that they re in it was identified as kessel said it s had some further migration during the year and to their credit they went ahead and dealt with it in the fourth quarter and charged it down to where out of luck there s any more exposure left so it s very one off ish and john kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer and john i ll just add again that we look at that entire syndicated book as part of the due diligence and again this was one that was npl at the time of due diligence so there s no surprises here at all to us kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer yes and since john asked i guess the industry was healthcare related john pancari evercore analyst got it okay all right that s helpful and then related to that on the credit side can you just talk about your charge off guidance that you re providing for 19 given where you came out in 18 it doesn t really imply an increase to the overall charge off level and then particularly even when you factor in the mark that you took on the fcb book so no real increase implied how do you look at that because more broadly the industry is going to see some incremental normalization of losses here and you would think that charge offs are going to be going higher and then lastly how do you still how do you feel about the mark the low mark that you took at this point thanks kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer i ll maybe start it i ll let kevin blair finish it but i mean we did if you look at if you just have the legacy part of synovus i think we were right around 20 basis points but if you look at the last two or three quarters we were probably more in the 24 25 range on average and that s kind of where we think the year will play out this coming year so if you just took our part if we re going into the year we would probably have guided somewhere in that 25 basis points range we don t see anything out there that gives us pause to maybe want to increase so we sort of stayed the same and then i think kevin maybe you can explain the purchase accounting better than me from there to kind of how we got the 15 to 20 kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer so john just our range is 20 to 30 and with the purchase accounting that we ll have on their portfolio with the credit mark as we ve said in the past based on the deal metrics it was 111 basis points would be right around the 105 million we ll obviously update that for the fair value of those loans when we this quarter and so when we appropriately mark those loans the expectation is there will not be any charge offs on those legacy fcb loans in 2019 so the only way that you could get a charge off in fcb would be any newly originated loan that would be through a payment default which would be highly unlikely so when you look at the math behind our 20 to 30 and their number largely coming in at 0 it would give you a rate that would come in between that 15 to 20 basis points john pancari evercore analyst okay thanks and then your thoughts on the mark kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer i think my thoughts on the mark are as we said we haven t seen any change or deterioration in the credit book itself there s been no change in the composition of the loans kessel mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks when you look at npa levels at 24 basis points delinquency levels at 11 basis points as well as the overall charge off level inclusive of this credit that we took this quarter at 14 basis points we still think that the math that we shared with the deal announcement makes sense but we ll be going through and updating that credit mark this quarter but i don t expect there to be any shift in what we thought from what we thought last time john pancari evercore analyst got it got it all right thanks kevin thanks guys kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks john operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst good morning guys kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst i guess i just wanted to hit up on the revenue growth guidance and i guess kevin give or take my sense is pro forma margin for 1q should be in the low 3 70s as we start off the year can you talk about one what happens with the margin where balance sheet growth turn outs to be lower than expected and what gives you confidence just in terms of loan growth like do you expect legacy synovus loan growth to be better in 19 versus 18 and where at fcb do you expect loan growth to come from in 19 given just this overall caution and i think kessel mentioned the high uncertainty would love any clarity on where you expect loan growth particularly fcb to come from kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer sure i ll start with nim and i ll try to walk ebrahim through the adjustments i mean the first two quarters are going to be a little messy with the margin and so let s just start with 3 92 where we ended this quarter what you should expect to see is roughly a 25 basis point decline in our margin that s a function of the math of the deal and so when you break that down it s 20 basis points just the combination of both companies margin plus an additional 5 basis points by losing the loan fees that are currently in the fcb margin that would be accounted for as part of the rate mark or as part of the mark on the loans so 25 basis points just due to the combination if we were to execute on a tier 2 issuance in the first or second quarter that would also dilute the margin by another 4 basis points based on a potential offering in addition to that there could be as much as 1 basis point that we would see in terms of margin compression associated with some modest restructuring of the fcb investment portfolio we re not going to make wholesale changes there but we may restructure a portion of that so that gives you roughly 30 basis points of decline to get you from the 3 92 to 3 62 from that point as kessel mentioned if you were to just look at today s forward curve and the interest rate environment there would be a bit of a headwind on our margin just due to the flatness of the yield curve the long end of the rates that have rallied it would make it more difficult to get margin expansion now we do include 5 basis points in our revenue guidelines associated with the scheduled paa with the rate mark on the loans as well as a small mark on our cd portfolio that will accrete in over the next 12 months we do not include any unscheduled yield accretion that would occur in 2019 so as you know the margin s going to be much more volatile with the purchase accounting side but we expect to see a margin post merger somewhere around 3 65 and so with all the puts and takes and our ability to restructure their liabilities the determination on whether there will be a rate hike in 2019 which we have not included that will be the deciding factors on where it moves from that level so moving over to loan growth in terms of the guidance as you ve mentioned we did guide 5 5 to 7 5 kessel mentioned that the legacy synovus portfolio would continue to grow in that mid single digit ranges of 4 to 6 so you would see more of a sustained growth level from the legacy synovus that would put the fcb portfolio in the high single digits into the 10 range and that s obviously much lower than what they ve done in the past and we feel very comfortable with both organizations ability to deliver the growth and as kessel mentioned the 2019 opportunities lie it comes in all asset classes and categories so we expect to see growth in c i in both organizations we have modest growth planned in cre and again that can come from both organizations and then we have consumer growth as we ve shared in the past fcb has not been as focused on the consumer lending asset class and although we will continue to get growth in legacy synovus we think there s opportunity to expand that into the fcb franchise so quite frankly we think there s going to be balanced growth and there s not any one big bet on any one asset class or category and then the last thing i ll mention to your question was what happens if we don t get loan growth one of the things that we ve tried to build as an organization is a much more dynamic revenue model so that if we do not get the level of loan growth the economy were to change we have other levers that we can pull to generate bottom line improvement that starts with the expense line item and we talked about kessel mentioned we will continue to deliver positive operating leverage again this year we had 2 6 times operating leverage in 2018 and so we think there s extra capacity there if you wouldn t get the growth on the revenue side we can manage the expense line item and then lastly from a share repurchase perspective if we re not getting organic growth as kessel mentioned that is the top priority we have additional capacity to repurchase shares which would also drive eps without getting the benefit of additional loan growth ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst so very helpful and i know there s a lot there in my question just one sort of follow up on the margin so the 3 65 starting point very clear should we not have any benefit from the december rate hike going into 1q to the particularly to the snv margin as we think about where 1q resets and is it and what level of deposit migration do you continue to expect either through time deposits or rising deposit betas as you think about your revenue guidance for the year kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer yes well i ll answer him quickly because he s cutting off but we ll get some benefits in probably the legacy synovus portfolio fcb largely mitigates that so it would be awash going from the december rate hike and as you look forward in terms of deposit migration we re actually seeing as rates pause we ll see less migration into higher cost deposits but as you ve noted both organizations over the last two quarters have had outsized sales in cds so the percentage of cds in terms of the total portfolio will increase in 2019 ebrahim poonawala bank of america analyst got it thanks for taking my questions kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey kbw analyst hi good morning guys steve adams senior director of investor relations good morning brady brady gailey kbw analyst so when you look at fcb i know you all talked about the cost savings in 2019 being 25 million or maybe even a little above that versus the initial expectation of 20 million but when you look longer term i mean i think 2020 is the first full year where you ll see full cost saves i know when you all announced the deal that number was around 26 of their expense base but what s the update for kind of the longer term kind of full cost save estimate for the deal kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer brady we haven t provided a 2020 view on that but i think you can read into our comments from the 25 million that we think there s additional opportunities in the long term cost savings similar to the last question with ebrahim if we get the level of revenue growth you may see the expenses staying more in line with the expectations if you re not getting it you may see additional expense savings but we feel very good about what we ve identified at this point we know where there are expenses in both organizations that are scalable and so we re going to be very mindful of the top line growth that we deliver and then we ll use the expense number to help mitigate any pressures we see on the revenue side so there s always opportunity there kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer and brady just to put an exclamation point on that i think the key takeaway today is that we found more sooner and that s a good thing is the 25 million versus the 20 million but before we update the longer term we d like to get a little further in get the systems conversion make sure that as we migrate customers we ve taken the appropriate care there and as we can give more guidance or more specific guidance in the long term we ll certainly do that brady gailey kbw analyst all right that s helpful and then my follow up is just about now that fcb is in the fold just an update on how you guys are positioned to rates i know historically synovus has been asset sensitive you ve all seen the net interest margin go up with these rate hikes if you look at the curve now and if you look with the fcb in there like i know you all used to provide the guidance of what plus 25 and plus 100 basis points would do maybe just an update on kind of where you consider synovus position related to rates with the fcb in there kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer great question brady we took that out this quarter just due to the fact that we didn t want to have a misleading slide in there that just included just the synovus asset sensitivity but what you should take away from that is that with the combination of fcb our asset sensitivity actually remains asset sensitive it actually mitigates or comes down just a little bit and that s solely based on the mix of cds that fcb has so our overall asset sensitivity is slightly less but we remain asset sensitive but what it does is and entering into a longer term view of rates and if we were to go into a declining rate environment in the foreseeable future it actually helps to mitigate some of the pressure that we would see on nii naturally without having to go out and do anything synthetically on terms of just a down 100 shock so it doesn t materially change our profile in the short term in terms of the plus 25 but it does give us an additional insurance for a down 25 or down 100 shock as we look at the long term brady gailey kbw analyst got it thanks guys kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks brady operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw wells fargo analyst hi good morning kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer good morning jared jared shaw wells fargo analyst just on the fcb charge off you said that that was included in the npl due diligence was that part of the credit mark the initial credit mark or was this in addition to the incremental credit mark kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer so great question jared it was partially included the credit mark what we do obviously in the credit market we would have taken that nonaccrual credit at the time and place some level of reserve what kevin howard said in his comments was that there s been additional migration on the credit since we did that july credit mark so we didn t have it fully marked in there but a large portion of it would have been considered in our initial credit mark jared shaw wells fargo analyst okay so with that charge off and then the incremental migration we shouldn t expect to see the actual final credit mark probably being too much different we shouldn t exclude that from the from the credit mark then at this point kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer i wouldn t because there could be other things that enter into the equation just with the growth that they ve had over the last several quarters but i think your math you re thinking about it the right way it was something that we had included there but not the full amount but it wouldn t have a material impact on the overall credit mark jared shaw wells fargo analyst okay thanks and for my follow up on the with the capital position now what s the appetite i guess for looking at additional m a as opposed to the buyback or should we expect that m a is completely off the table at this point kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer jared it s certainly off the table at this point as i ve said often our focus is on getting this one integrated and get the cost save we ve talked about get the revenue synergies that we really believe will come and truly begin operating as one company and you don t prove that out in 1 or 2 quarters maybe even 1 year or so yes it s completely off the table we certainly always evaluate m a you could look at as i ve told every investment banker out there find me another global one which is a non bank that s bolt on with an earnout and could that be attractive sure but for whole bank m a that s off the table we ve got both teams and when i say both teams really one team now but everybody s excited about the opportunities and it s going to take this year and i believe next year to prove that out to prove what we strongly believe today so our efforts are on execution i think our teams have done a great job by the way getting this from deal announcement to deal close in 161 days i think that speaks to our process to our ability to plan organize and execute i think it speaks to regulatory credibility i think it speaks to really good efficient operation we want to take that same energy now and move it toward systems conversion and then the real work begins as i told at dinner last week that s when the real work begins which is running the company in a way that provides the value to the combined customer base that we believe it does so that was a 5 minute answer to yes you can take m a off the table jared shaw wells fargo analyst great thank you operator the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire jefferies analyst yes thanks good morning kevin blair just a clarification question for you on the revenue outlook does the 5 5 to 7 5 is that bake in the cost of tier 2 instruments kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer it does include some level of tier 2 instruments in there casey haire jefferies analyst okay great so all right okay and then just following up on the cre and the loan growth guide it sounds like cre you guys that s been a soft category for you in 18 but you do expect growth just what s the underlying confidence with on the cre front given what sounds like a pretty competitive environment kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer yes i think a couple of things i think we had a good last couple of quarters of new construction loans that were originated that will start to fund up we think a little bit higher than maybe the pace has been in the last few quarters that s been primarily in the multifamily space in some of the owner occupied space as well and also and i probably said this too many times but we feel like the payoff velocity even really never seem to let up during the year and i just look our outlook is that the payoff velocity will be less next year than this year and then our construction fundings will be better next year going in plus we have better territory to lend in i mean we re better in the florida markets that we re now more deeply involved in should also give us a little bit there so you put those kind of 3 things together i m not saying cre s going to jump off the page it was negative i think 5 or so for the year in growth i think it gets at least probably low single digits which is a good improvement it is driven by those 3 components that we believe going into 19 operator next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jp morgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst hey good morning everybody kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst i wanted to start on the deposit cost so if we look interest bearing deposit costs were up 13 bps in the quarter which is the same as 3q how do you guys see that progressing through 2019 kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer it s a great question steven because this is kevin blair what you re going to see obviously the first quarter you re going to get a similar level of repricing off of the december rate hike the betas that we had in fourth quarter were much lower than what we saw in the third quarter for total interest bearing deposits we had a beta of 52 versus a 67 beta in the prior quarter we expect to see a similar impact in the first quarter it s going to be somewhere around the 60 beta based on that december rate hike now post first quarter and assuming no additional rate hikes what you re going to see is there s going to be a natural increase in our cost of interest bearing deposits just as we refund our maturing cds so to give you 2 data points there our portfolio cd portfolio today has a rate of 1 50 our new and renewing rate that we had in the same quarter was about 1 77 now those numbers are becoming much more aligned but if we look out into the first quarter of this year we can see that what s maturing is at a much lower rate as we look out into the second quarter and beyond what s maturing is carrying a higher rate but there s still a difference between what we re putting on new promotional cds or the average and what s rolling off so there will be a little bit of a headwind associated with time deposits but we think that we can help to mitigate that from a total margin perspective as we continue to see repricing fixed rate loans that will mature as well as some of our shorter duration loans that will renew and potentially at a higher rate so it will increase in 2019 but not at the same pace steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay that s helpful and then my follow up for kessel what are your plans for the deposit franchise at fcb i mean do you just run off all their higher cost funding they have quite a bit of that and do you need to actually invest in their deposit franchise to improve their mix they were known previously having a great deposit mix thanks kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer now we do invest there are plans right now with the existing physical locations that we think we can invest in and maybe some changes at our existing footprint our retail teams are very involved right now they were a part from day 1 in planning in terms of additional product offerings maybe take some pressure off in terms of when they re having to fund outsized loan growth in their own footprint there are only a couple of ways to do that quickly we can take some pressure off and really introduce more product a more disciplined sales approach we think that over time certainly allows us to change the mix but our retail teams are fast at work to do that right now our private wealth teams are energized there as well our small business teams again all things that products and services that come with more core deposits it s really certainly no criticism of their model but when your customer base is that middle market banking it s hard to fund dollar for dollar with your deposits we think that we think a more balanced approach will serve them well and serve us well steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst thanks for the color kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve operator the next question comes from tyler stafford with stephens inc please go ahead tyler stafford stephens inc analyst hi good morning guys kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning tyler tyler stafford stephens inc analyst i just wanted to clarify a few things on the revenue guide what s the total dollars of scheduled accretable yield that s in that revenue guide and then can you just confirm that the 3 65 margin you pointed to is that a gaap or a core nim kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer got it so tyler let me go back so the 3 65 i said included 5 basis points of accretable yield that was scheduled so that s about 27 million currently and that s just based on our math that we came off the deal metrics it s about 11 million on a 1 year cd accretion and then we have about 16 million in the first year for the rate mark on the loan books so about 27 million is included that s about 5 basis points in margin so if you were to back that out core margin would be somewhere around 3 62 tyler stafford stephens inc analyst okay and then i know in the 19 guide this year you folded in the fee growth into the revenue growth but i guess i m just trying to triangulate to the total revenue growth that you re looking at just given the loan growth and the margin commentary to me it implies a fairly sizable step up in fees so can you just talk about any color that the fee growth that s kind of embedded within the revenue growth for the year and how you re thinking about the fee growth kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer yes it s still going to be mid single digits and if you look at where we ve had the biggest headwind this year tyler it s been on mortgage and we think that we can change the trajectory of the year over year decline there we ve obviously been adding a lot of mortgage loan originators our production was down this year both on the secondary and portfolio mortgage side but on the secondary more so and so as we add these mortgage loan originators we think the market will continue to we ll be able to take share from the market and you will not see a year over year decline so just not having that will be a benefit but we also see continued growth in our fiduciary asset management brokers business we re optimistic on our capital markets business we have a strong fourth quarter in swaps we know that fcb is also a heavy user of customer derivatives so we re optimistic there and then we also continue to see good growth in our card fee businesses as you know we rebranded and relaunched our consumer credit card we also have a strong iso business there and the interchange on our debit card fees have generated somewhere around a 9 growth year over year so when you add up all the minor components we feel very optimistic that we ll get strong growth year over year and mostly it s different from this year in only that you won t have the abatement of the mortgage income unidentified participant analyst got it okay thanks kevin that s very helpful operator next question comes from brad milsaps with sandler o neill please go ahead brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst hey good morning guys kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning brad brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst kevin i just wanted to get some clarity on the additional clarity on the expense number the 2 to 4 guidance that doesn t include that includes the 25 million of cost saves but does not include the essentially offset number in goodwill amortization is that correct kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer yes so we did that and we footnoted hopefully you saw that brad and the only reason for that is in the past synovus has excluded the amortization of intangibles from its adjusted expense base and so mainly because it was not a large number so for this exercise we felt like we wanted to stay consistent with the categories and not confuse folks so just know that there is roughly 20 million in there that would be in total expenses that s not included in that line item that would be associated with the amortization of the core deposit intangible brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst and safe to assume the upper end of the expense guide would equate to the upper end of the revenue guide kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer that s right brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst okay and then just final follow up back to the tier 2 issuance how much of the buyback would you guys be willing to fund or could fund without any tier 2 issuance kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer i mean it s really dependent that number moves based on what the organic loan growth is so it s hard to give you an answer with that if you didn t if you hit your targets for loan growth there s still a modest capability to buy back shares if you exceed your loan growth it starts to diminish the ability to buy back shares so it s hard to answer that without going through each quarter and seeing what risk weighted asset growth looks like brad milsaps sandler o neill analyst great thank you very much kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks brad operator the next question is from jennifer demba with suntrust please go ahead jennifer demba suntrust robinson humphreys inc analyst thank you good morning could you talk about the enhancements you re making to your mobile and online platform that you discussed inflated the consulting fees in the fourth quarter and then my second question is there s been a lot of rhetoric in the industry about enhanced competition for leveraged loans just wondering if you have those outstanding kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer yes i ll let kevin take the leverage loans jennifer i ll take the enhancement we have spent a lot of time over the past 12 months investing in our new customer portal my synovus i personally have done the pilot for maybe 3 or 4 months we hit another great milestone this past thursday night when we added more and launched the enhanced pilot which we believe we will roll out to our customers in the first quarter it is state of the art it s sleek it is a great customer experience i don t like inflating consulting fees but when they deliver a product or service to the customers which we think will be as good as any out there they excite me the entire executive team actually had a demo yesterday of the new technical difficulty and so we re very excited about it we re excited about how our existing customer will view it and we re excited about how a potential customer will view it as it relates to the technology capabilities that come with a bank our size so first quarter launch very successful launch of the new pilot thursday night and there s still a couple of bugs because you always want to work out but i couldn t be more pleased with our progress and i think i speak for our entire team about their excitement about the mobile experience kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer yes i ll follow up on the kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer leverage lending kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer leverage lending this is kevin jennifer it s not a big part of what we do it s low single digits of our portfolio typically if we re in a leverage loan it s an existing relationship that may have made an acquisition short term related so it s a small part of our book a small part of our c i lending is in the leverage side jennifer demba suntrust robinson humphreys inc analyst and that low single digit is that off the c i portfolio or off total loans kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer it would be about 7 or so percent of our c i and about 3 3 5 of our total loans so it s and that s about where we re comfortable at jennifer demba suntrust robinson humphreys inc analyst okay thanks so much kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks jennifer operator the next question comes from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose raymond james analyst hi thanks for taking my questions just on the fcb side just trying to figure out why their margin was actually down when libor was up so much in the quarter it may have had to do with that credit that was mentioned earlier but i guess can you give us a sense for kind of what their margin expectations would be on a stand alone basis kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer michael the non accrual loan was 1 basis point of the decline the other 2 basis points had more to do with just the mix shift they continue to bring in cds and as you know that artificially increases the beta because of the mix shift into the fixed rate deposit so they got actually very similar to us their increase on the asset side was on top of ours so they ve got the same benefit that we saw on libor it s just that their mix shift drove the other drove the decline on a quarterly basis as you look out into the future it s hard to say what theirs would have looked like under their existing strategies but we think that we can as we combine them with our nim we ll be able to normalize their funding costs and get betas that are more in line with what we have so you d like to think that they would perform more similar to what we ve had in the past but it s hard to do that looking into the future knowing what that would look like michael rose raymond james analyst understood and then maybe just one follow up question on them specifically you mentioned paydowns on their side is that more episodic or is that somewhat of a structural change just given the proliferation of non bank lenders moving downstream thanks kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer it was episodic they noted three credits that paid out early and i think that that s just to your point it may be due to non bank competition people are out there moving their financing to permanent financing as soon as they can so they were episodic and for their portfolio given the size you can have one or two or three and it makes a big difference in their outstandings but it s not something that they ve seen over the last several quarters so these appear to be more episodic michael rose raymond james analyst okay and then maybe just one follow up just as you move forward you ve talked about lower hold limits for them can you give us any update there on kind of what that means kevin j howard executive vice president and chief wholesale banking officer talk about loan hold this is kevin i ll talk about loan hold limits they re similar with ours i don t think there ll be any change either way we noted that early on in the due diligence process they have a strong middle market lending team that lines up real similar to our corporate lending team and so i just i don t see a whole lot of that changing at all so if i stay we re real similar in those categories michael rose raymond james analyst okay thanks for taking my questions guys operator next question comes from christopher marinac with fig partners please go ahead christopher marinac fig partners analyst thanks just quickly guys the change in the wholesale or excuse me the change in the total funding coming from fcb to what extent are there new opportunities that you see now that you didn t see before and then also to what extent can you use the funding capacity of existing synovus franchise perhaps that you haven t done in previous years kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer chris we think there s tremendous opportunity there kessel highlighted some of that earlier from my perspective there s really three strategies one there are certain higher cost deposits that they have today that we ll be able to eliminate in the coming quarters if you look at our loan to deposit ratio this quarter we came in at 97 1 on a pro forma basis it takes us to 94 and so if we were to just look at some of their lower value deposits we feel very comfortable running some of those off and putting our loan to deposit ratio back to the level we re at today so that s the first opportunity the second opportunity is as kessel mentioned earlier some of the products and solutions that we currently offer through existing channels so selling our products and solutions to their branches making sure that we re using not only their capabilities but ours to have outsized growth i d give an example in the past if you re going to do a cd promotion if you re going to do it in south florida you re probably going to pay a 20 basis point premium to generate the volume we can do those and spread it out throughout our footprint and mitigate some of the increased costs of that funding and then the longer term opportunity as kessel mentioned was on the customer segment side as fcb has been mostly focused on that middle market corporate banking customer segment the cost of their deposits are generally higher because they re more sophisticated customer as we roll out our small business our private wealth management play there s going to be a lot of core deposit generation that comes with those and they won t happen in the first quarter but they ll start to occur over time and that provides a new funding base at a much lower cost that will allow us to pick and choose the wholesale funding that comes in at a much higher cost christopher marinac fig partners analyst and kevin my follow up is just related to kind of the funding differentials within the synovus footprint i mean if you look at your major metro areas versus your non metro areas you still have an advantage today that you can do more of to your point is that right kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer that s correct we have models that we look at that look at price elasticity by market and that s how we choose where to do our promotions and that s how we determine the ultimate market level price that we provide so yes there is an advantage to be in these rural markets we ve talked about in the past the legacy synovus portfolio has 60 of its deposits in non metro markets so that s a very stable funding base that generally has a lower funding cost christopher marinac fig partners analyst great thanks very much for this background guys kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer thanks chris operator the last question today comes from garrett holland with baird please go ahead garrett holland baird analyst good morning and thanks for taking the questions just following up on that last point to what extent are the potential revenue synergies with fcb or really the lower the marginal funding cost included in the 19 outlook kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer they re really not included at all and it s something that we ve said from day one garrett that as we continue to focus on improving the collective franchise that we re not going to come out and bid against ourselves and keep upping the ante to say how great this could be we re going to deliver on those results and so as we have the opportunity throughout 2019 and the reason that we haven t provided more detail around that is it largely depends on what the interest environment is to be able to tell you what sort of benefit we can achieve on the liability side and on the revenue synergy piece as kessel mentioned earlier our game plan there is we re going to start sharing with the investment community the benefits that we re able to achieve from the synergies as we start to achieve them so it doesn t become a goal but rather a scorecard on how well we re performing and generating those garrett holland baird analyst no that sounds good and just one quick follow up so with more anxiety broadly on the outlook for credit costs i m just curious what the charge off assumption is embedded in the updated financial targets and how that normalized loss rate may have changed with the addition of fcb thank you kevin blair senior executive vice president chief operating officer generally we keep for the three year targets we provide a similar economic forecast we re not trying to predict where the next recession is coming so you would expect to see charge offs continue in a similar pace but they would increase slightly each year as there s a larger portfolio that s not covered under purchase accounting so going back to the synovus guideline of 20 to 30 you probably could use that as a longer term guidance for the company s long term targets garrett holland baird analyst much appreciated operator this concludes our question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to kessel stelling for any closing remarks kessel d stelling jr chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and i ll be brief thanks for you all in staying with us through what s maybe one of the longer calls we ve done and we re happy to do that we really do appreciate everyone who s been on the call today including many of our retail shareholders our team members we know we get a lot of people on this call so i just want to really thank the team for the great job they ve done and getting us to this point for a great 2018 for just extraordinary effort both on the fcb and the synovus side over the last couple or three months during the holidays to again get to a legal day 1 closing which just sets up the next events in a really great way so stay tuned as kevin said as we get closer to conversion as we get our team working more closely together we certainly hope to capitalize on revenue synergies and we ll share those as we get them but in the meantime our focus will be on again core blocking and tackling with our core banking making sure that this extra merger of systems conversions and customers goes well so thank you very much for your interest again thanks to our team and we look forward to sharing more about our results on the next earnings call thank you very much operator this conference is now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect duration 78 minutes call participants steve adams senior director of investor relations kessel d stelling jr chairman

photo illustrations by julie moran and istock the 2019 economic forecast hosted by the lyons companies and the university of delaware s alfred lerner college of business and economics center for economic education and entrepreneurship ceee will bring together distinguished voices that influence determine and interpret u s economic policy to discuss the upcoming year s economic climate on tuesday feb 19 the goal of the event is to provide the local delaware financial community with a better understanding of how the upcoming year s economic climate will affect local business and registration is now open the keynote speaker will be loretta j mester president and chief executive officer of the federal reserve bank of cleveland mester was a voting member of the fed s open markets committee in 2018 joan k woodard president of travelers institute and and executive vice president for public policy with travelers companies inc will be one panelist for a discussion moderated by jon hilsenrath of the wall street journal joining woodward among the speakers will be michael k farr author cnbc contributor and president of investment advisory firm farr miller washington llc farr has been a dynamic thought provoking and engaging presenter at previous economic forecasts and will be back for the 11th time this year in advance of the event farr shared thoughts about monetary policy tax cuts the gross domestic product and their impacts on the average american q the federal reserve board s fed interest rate policy has been a focus of the news lately how do you think this will impact the conversation at the 2019 economic forecast farr the fed has never been as vital as it has been in the last 10 years to financial markets and economic growth both non financial corporate debt and government debt have exploded during the course of the economic recovery and this has been made possible by the fed s suppression of interest rates at close to 0 for an unprecedented eight years everybody has a stake in what the fed is doing right now the fed is affecting more than just borrowing costs for houses cars and other big ticket items the fed s monetary policy also affects stock and bond prices retirement plans corporate investment the labor market inflation and demand for many of the goods and services we buy every day everybody s a stakeholder based on what the fed is doing and that s a little bit different than the past this is not just a wall street thing the housing market is particularly sensitive to interest rate increases we ve seen mortgage rates go up significantly from a low of about 3 4 to about 5 0 before coming back down to about 4 5 the increase in rates has negatively affected affordability new construction turnover and prices because the housing sector contributes an estimated 15 18 of gdp per national association of home builders and including spending on housing services like rent and utilities housing can often be an early indicator of the economy s future trajectory q you say that everybody is a stakeholder in what the fed is doing what can people gain from participating in the economic forecast farr the opportunity to hear directly from loretta mester a federal reserve president who is in the room when policy is made and can share insights about the board s internal machinations is remarkable for businesses fed policy is of utmost importance as it can affect their cost of capital which is used to fund their growth the more affordable that capital is meaning the cost of borrowing the more sense it makes for them to take the chance to invest in growth they can invest in people they can invest in plants and equipment or they can invest in new technologies all of those things are based on how much money costs and what kind of returns are possible with that capital therefore lower interest rates have historically been supportive of growth in the economy at large in a growing economy you also expect the demand for workers to increase which leads to higher wage growth for the students coming to the economic forecast event right now as opposed to when i first started making presentations at the university of delaware 10 years ago it s a lot easier for them to land a job it s going to be even easier for them to get a job with a university of delaware degree and they re going to get paid more than they would have been paid five years ago they should also expect to see their incomes grow throughout their early years of being employed after they graduate q what is the value that you see in the 2019 economic forecast event that compelled you to participate farr i ve always been impressed by the lyons companies commitment to both the university of delaware and to economic and entrepreneurial education i feel that this event is a way for me to support those efforts the individual federal reserve banks have an educational mandate and they realize that ud provides a fabulous economic education and values entrepreneurship so they vote with their feet for over 10 years federal reserve presidents from different banks around the country have said i m going to travel to newark delaware they are coming to a place that they recognize as being important for economic education it is a great privilege to join various industry executives and fed presidents to learn from one another and to share our perspectives with both the academic and business community at one of the nation s finest universities q do you expect that much will change between now and the event in february that might be reflected in the conversation farr i think that the economy continues to be relatively strong but we saw a shift in 2018 there was a spike in economic growth that was fueled by not only continued low interest rates but also a big corporate tax cut it was a tax cut also for most individuals but the most significant part was a corporate tax cut there was also a big federal spending bill these two policy initiatives represented episodic infusions of cash into the economy fueled by debt that were supposed to have generated and ignited not only higher but also more sustainable rates of economic growth so far that really hasn t happened and we re returning to the 2 2 5 economic growth that we saw prior to the tax cut and the deficit spending bill that was passed last march however it can be argued that sometimes these things can take a while to percolate so we may see that growth still what i predict is what we re seeing now which is a return to 2 2 5 gdp growth and i don t think that s a bad thing

cent is needed this year and in 2020 to meet the ruling communist party s long standing goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020 and to turn china into a modestly prosperous nation china has lowered the level of reserves that commercial banks need to set aside for the fifth time in a year to spur lending particularly to small and medium sized firms beijing has also cut taxes and fees and stepped up infrastructure investment to shore up the economy this year china will step up fiscal expenditure and implement larger tax and fee cuts the cuts will focus on reducing burdens for small firms and manufacturers the finance ministry said in a statement on tuesday but government efforts to channel more funds to the struggling private sector are facing big hurdles banks are wary of more bad debts amid the long regulatory crackdown and many businesses are in no mood to make new investments in the face of faltering sales stabilising employment is the government s top priority ndrc vice chairman lian weiliang said at a news conference on tuesday briefing reporters on the measures that are in the works following december s economic work conference china will speed up investment projects and local government bond issuance but will not resort to flood like stimulus mr lian said the central bank in a separate statement issued at the press conference said it will maintain prudent monetary policy with appropriate tightness and looseness monetary policy will be made more forward looking flexible and targeted the people s bank of china pboc said but a prudent monetary policy does not mean that there will be no changes deputy governor zhu hexin said apart from cutting the reserve requirement ratios rrrs for commercial banks the central bank has also increasingly turned to open market operations in particular the medium term lending facility or mlf to maintain a generous pool of funding cutting benchmark interest rates may be the last resort as that could weigh on the yuan and fuel debt risks analysts have said when asked if the pboc should cut benchmark rates mr zhu said existing monetary policy measures should be improved regarding the question of interest rate cuts people are paying more attention to it our current monetary policy including overall policy rrr cuts and medium term lending facility helps us adapt to the overall economic environment and price levels he said chinese banks extended a record 16 17 trillion yuan in net new yuan loans last year the pboc said blowing past the previous high of

joão lourenço has been president of angola since 26 september 2017 about one year later he cemented his hold on power by taking over the chairmanship of the ruling movimento popular de libertação de angola mpla although he reshuffled the government for instance by replacing the transport minister and the vice president manuel vicente most other ministerial posts had not changed from the previous administration despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption which he has described as a scourge on society his actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions and declarations past and present lourenço inherited a dire economic situation characterised by serious shortages of foreign currency particularly of the u s dollar and the continual devaluation of the kwanza the currency depreciated 40 per cent against the greenback in 2018 in addition inflation has hovered around 30 per cent and is set to rise advertisement angola s economic troubles began in 2014 when global crude oil prices dipped and severely hampered the government s ability to generate revenue angola depends on oil for 75 per cent of its government revenue and 90 per cent of its exports this over dependency on the hydrocarbon sector left the country vulnerable to economic shocks potentially placing the country into an irrecoverable position diversification has long been the answer but execution of a strategy and plan never materialised in the previous administration lourenço s chief election campaign plank centered on reducing the dependency on angola s hydrocarbons sector and creating new revenue streams from existing resources or developing new ones diversification was also a key condition for the international monetary fund imf to agree to a three year extended fund facility for angola worth usd3 7 billion which the creditor announced on 7 december 2018 usd990 million would be immediately disbursed ending corruption including bribery and money laundering was another condition diversification an urgent priority angola is in desperate need of cash and therefore lourenço is pursuing an ambitious investment programme to develop the country s agricultural tourism and mining assets for instance the government is planning to invest usd230 million across the country over the next six years to support its proyectode desarrollodeagricultura comercial a development initiative launched last december which aims to commercialise the agricultural sector over usd77 million had already been invested in such projects countrywide at the end of 2018 oil majors such as the u k s bp france s total and u s oil giant exxonmobil have also signed memoranda of understanding with the state owned oil company sonangol to develop new ultra deep offshore oil operations however the amount of the investments has not yet been made public advertisement a lot of the money for the new investments appears guaranteed by the government against the backdrop of a poor economic outlook coupled with crude oil prices below the levels the government had counted on although brent crude prices rebounded early this year off the back of a production cut agreed by opec member states angola will have to resort to more borrowing thanks to reprofiling of its debt through the issuing of usd5 billion worth of euro and dollar denominated bonds likely explains the reduced fiscal deficit as maturities have been extended in the medium term however debt to gdp remained at a risky 90 per cent at the end of 2018 meaning that more commercial loans will be needed to finance the ambitious investment programme and will continue to damage economic growth prospects not least because china is angola s largest purchaser of oil meanwhile angola already owes beijing a lot of money official figures put this at usd23 billion last year but due to the lack of reliable data this number could be much higher furthermore as a lot of that debt with china has been guaranteed through oil swap deals increased volatility in crude oil prices is likely to again create more financial headaches for the government foreign investors are also likely to be concerned as a growing debt burden will hinder the government s ability to honour its debt repayments and ability to unlock financial resources for instance to pay for projects or salaries to its civil servants anti corruption lourenço also pledged to stamp out corruption which he has described as a scourge on society international observers were positively surprised when he sacked the children of ex president dos santos from key positions within the state owned oil company sonangol and angola s sovereign wealth fund fsdea josé filomeno a son of the former president and former head of fsdea and his business ally dual swiss angolan national jean claude bastos de morais were arrested in angola in september 2018 on charges they had conspired to defraud the state in multiple jurisdictions including in switzerland and the united kingdom both have denied wrongdoing authorities in mauritius switzerland and the u k froze their assets while investigations were ongoing however london s commercial court which is part of its high court lifted the freezing order due to what it said were serious procedural failings in the original complaint notwithstanding and based on a recognition that corruption was conducted with impunity under the previous administration lourenço s government in may last year adopted an amnesty bill for the voluntary repatriation of stolen state funds that had been moved offshore the true extent of angola s corruption problem is unclear but authorities both in angola and the u s have indicated that close to usd30 billion in illicitly obtained money from the state is being held in offshore accounts but the amnesty bill which expired in december appears to have attracted little interest according to legal practitioners on the ground and few actually repatriated any money the government has promised to now coercively go after those who have stolen public funds and hidden it abroad advertisement angola s ability to do this remains in doubt repatriation of financial assets will also depend on the willingness of banks abroad to transfer back the money tightening anti money laundering legislation across the world will make commercial banks especially those in oecd countries more averse to high risk jurisdictions like angola diminishing the effectiveness of the law since de risking of angola s banking sector took place after the collapse of portugal s banco espirito santo in part due to toxic credit at its angolan subsidiary hardly any western banks have resumed correspondent banking relationships for transacting in u s dollars which explains a lot of angola s current problems but because oil dependent angola s financial sector is highly dollarised such correspondent banking is also key to repatriate the stolen funds placing doubt about the likely success of lourenço s policies his advisors should be aware of that restoring trust depends on the government s ability to reform the financial sector which remains concentrated around a few politically exposed persons among angolan banks shareholders of the 27 commercial banks registered with banco nacional de angola the central bank and sector regulator five control over 80 per cent of total banking assets deposits and loans in addition the banking sector is highly centralised with the vast majority of angolans and small and medium sized enterprises unable to access formal credit instead the bulk of credit given by angolan banks goes to a few hundred chosen investors given that diversification is a priority of the lourenço presidency his ability to also restructure the financial sector will be critical from reformist to a return to old habits the government s new policies have indeed caught many media headlines but lourenço s own behavior during his first year in office also contradict his narrative it started with lavish spending during a state visit to europe where the angolan delegation signed several agricultural development projects with french financiers among others according to reports on the maka angola news website the angolan delegation went on a spending spree chartering at least three aircraft including a boeing 787 vip private airliner a boeing 737 and a gulfstream business jet according to the leasing company the boeing 787 cost usd74 000 an hour to charter it goes without saying that this sort of spending does not marry well with lourenço s promises and his narrative of being a modest person others have pointed to the lourenço family s real estate property in the town of bethesda maryland united states a report by u s newspaper the washington post citing public records said the property was purchased in 2013 for usd1 7 million by the lourenço family while it is not illegal for angolans to own property abroad as a primary residence such revelations will probably fuel suspicions about the president s true intentions advertisement more questions emerge over lourenço s positioning vis à vis the former vice president manuel vicente who portuguese prosecutors in 2017 charged with bribing that country s attorney general in 2011 lourenço refused to recognise the portuguese authorities competency to try vicente and lambasted the charges as interference by the former colonial power it was agreed that vicente would be tried in angola instead this never occurred although vicente has been sidelined from the mpla leadership he remains an influential businessman in both angola and abroad another worrying trend is potential nepotism and conflicts of interest including within the military in april 2018 the president promoted his brother general sequeira joão lourenço as deputy head of the president s intelligence bureau which oversees the military the police and the intelligence services two months prior he allegedly sold a state owned aircraft to his brother s aviation company sjl aeronáutica without a public tender and at an undisclosed price it does not end there his plans to expand the military budget should sound some alarm bells while already having among the largest military budgets on the continent lourenço is intent on expanding it further one reason raised has been to fight piracy as angola is looking to expand its offshore oil production operations and modernizing its naval capabilities would ensure security of such operations against such threats this is despite angola suffering hardly any such attacks in its waters over the past few years although official figures indicate that angola s military budget halved between 2014 and 2017 well respected sweden based think tank sipri has noted that estimates of real military spending are hard to come by across sub saharan africa despite the decline in september 2016 middle east based privinvest group announced on its website that it would provide naval vessels to the angolan navy and construct a ship building facility together with a london based partner around that same time it was revealed that privinvest had signed contracts to supply ships to mozambique which were never delivered the deal along with two others left mozambique with a massive bill of usd2 1 billion more than its total national debt at the time on 29 december south african police arrested manuel chang mozambique s finance minister when the deals with privinvest were signed on suspicion of fraud relating to the deal this followed an indictment by the u s district court of new york city which led to the arrest of jean boustani an executive of privinvest three former bankers of swiss bank credit suisse and a dozen more have also been indicted for their role in the scheme while privinvest was not the only company involved with inflating mozambique s debt to astronomical levels the company has faced resistance in other jurisdictions such as nigeria paris based the africa report revealed in june 2018 that the nigerian finance minister in 2014 had refused to accept a usd2 billion investment proposal from privinvest after it appeared clear that nigeria would have to provide most of the guarantees for the loans that would finance the joint venture privinvest had reportedly proposed to take control over a derelict shipyard from the nigerian navy and refurbish it that angola has signed a deal with privinest under lourenço s watch granted he was defence minister at the time may therefore also concern investors especially since the government never confirmed the investment furthermore in may 2018 credit suisse announced a usd700 million loan to angola advertisement conclusion napoleon walks if lourenço is serious about eradicating corruption he should be careful with who he deals with and how this may look to the outside so far his defence scorecard his lavish spending support for vicente and family appointments can only undermine his credibility that the highest ranks of the mpla and the broader governing elite in angola remain intact bar a few cosmetic changes to the political bureau the apex governing body of the mpla is also worrying adopting policies that indeed are likely conditions imposed by international financiers such as the imf but that in reality are unlikely to produce any change in behaviours not only puts his own track record at risk but also the reputation of the entire country furthermore the lack of criminal convictions of former senior officials not only of the former president s family but also other high ranking mpla cadres suggests that their behaviour will not change either the authorities are deliberately delaying the processes to get some initial goodwill from foreign investors or the system is so slow that no conviction will serve to deter future corrupt behaviour the end result is that foreign investors and financiers engaging in angola are setting themselves up to considerable compliance and legal risks giving the new president the benefit of the doubt may have been valid in his first year but the lack of progress should prompt them to adopt a more cautious approach just as napoleon in george orwell s animal farm promised a whole new way of governing once in power he quickly adopted the same habits as his former steward read more

can as u s president donald trump has suggested the united states devastate turkey economically probably economic sanctions are more powerful when targeted at allies than adversaries because there are more and more important economic ties between allies for example the united states is turkey s fourth largest source of imports and fifth largest source of exports just two measures of the links between the turkish and u s economies u s economic power was on full display last summer trump threatened via tweet large sanctions unless turkey released a u s clergyman implausibly accused of involvement in turkey s failed 2016 coup attempt immediately the turkish lira fell 4 5 percent against the dollar after the administration sanctioned two turkish cabinet ministers an unprecedented step against allied senior officials the lira fell another 10 percent what happened next was even weirder than sanctioning an ally rather than responding to a potential currency crisis with well developed tools to stabilize the situation and prevent the spread of financial instability to other emerging markets trump announced that the united states would double tariffs on turkish steel and aluminum again by tweet replete with gloating about the lira moving rapidly downward against our very strong dollar the lira s slide turned into a rout with the currency dropping more than 18 percent in a single day jarrett blanc jarrett blanc was a senior fellow in the geoeconomics and strategy program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more the united states did not push the issue further the u s clergyman was released and the lira stabilized in the meantime the cost of borrowing increased confidence decreased and growth slowed dramatically from 5 3 percent in the second quarter to 1 6 percent in the third why is turkey s economy so susceptible to u s sanctions this story reflects the fragility of turkey s economy turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan has become increasingly autocratic and eccentric he has grabbed power from turkey s nominally independent central bank and has insisted on keeping interest rates down despite increasing inflation a problem given the turkish private sector s dependence on foreign debt in foreign currencies his attacks on institutions after the failed 2016 coup ranging from the courts to the press to schools have reduced confidence in the country as a business partner and investment target appointing his forty year old son in law finance minister in july only aggravated the business community s fears under these conditions the united states could do damage with a couple of sanctions and a tariff announcement it has many more sanctions and other corrosive economic tools available should it choose to use them what would be the turkish response are there any negative economic or political consequences for the united states turkey can respond to u s pressure with a range of political steps anything from refusing to cooperate on policies toward syria iraq or iran to limiting operations at i̇ncirlik air base where the united states inexplicably stores nuclear weapons and there is always the unforeseen when the united states sanctioned the turkish ministers of justice and the interior in august washington could not have imagined that it would depend on turkish security and law enforcement agencies to understand saudi arabia s murder of journalist and u s resident jamal khashoggi in october more than this though there is the risk of overreach in u s sanctions policy forcing allies and partners to find ways to work around the u s banking system officials in europe and other global economic powers are already nervous that the united states is abusing its dominant banking position with capricious sanctions on iran russia and others targeting a nato ally will surely push partners and adversaries to look harder for financial structures that bypass the united states and minimize the risks associated with u s sanctions
business insider interviewed star china debt analyst charlene chu about the hottest debate in chinese economics right now whether the country s slowdown is due to its trade war with the us or structural factors she came down on the latter side and said if stimulus measures do work they will take around a year to make a positive impact on the economy chu also explained a five second indicator that will tell us when the slowdown is over in even the best case scenario china s economy will continue to slow precipitously until the first quarter of next year autonomous research analyst charlene chu told business insider in an interview the trade stuff is dominating the headlines so people make that connection but the reality is the tariffs aren t hitting that much she said when we talk to companies on the ground in china they say the tariffs have had a small impact partly because the move in currency has offset that the slowdown says chu is all because of the chinese government s crackdown on shadow banking the most important thing that drives growth in china is credit she added it s an economy that lives on new funding and last year that gas was down by about 40 relative to 2017 by our numbers and chu s numbers matter a great deal whether at fitch rating agency the new york federal reserve or her current posts at autonomous research she has been the go to china analyst for those at the highest levels of government and finance for almost two decades all of this is not to say that the trade war doesn t matter if the us were to increase its tariffs on chinese goods to 25 as they very well may if negotiators do not come to an agreement by march 1 the tariffs would start to take a big bite out of china s economy she says but they would only worsen the pain policymakers inflicted on the economy when they clamped down on shadow banking in the fourth quarter of 2017 that decision took time to trickle through the chinese economy and finally it started appearing in data in the fourth quarter of last year just when chu said it would what can i do the headlines have been coming fast and furious on monday a fresh batch of bad economic data was immediately followed by an announcement from china s policymakers they reiterated their commitment to stimulating the economy as much as possible and announced more tax cuts but as chu pointed out to business insider as we show total tax revenue in china is just cny16 trillion or 17 5 of gdp even something aggressive like cutting all taxes by a fifth yields just cny3 2 trillion there s also been talk of an auto stimulus which china also did last year and subsidies to buy home appliances like washers and dryers and of course there s always aggressive fiscal stimulus which chu says policymakers don t seem to be considering quite yet china is likely to hold its firepower until after trade talks are finished there are a few reasons for this according to chu for one policymakers will need to know what they re dealing with and for another a deal with the united states may come with certain stipulations that limit what china can do american negotiators will likely insist that china keep its currency stable for example which would rule out any action that would weaken the yuan for china a weaker currency could make exports more competitive and annoy the trump administration but it could also lead to currency outflows a problem that plagued china during its 2015 2016 slowdown it started to rear its ugly head a bit again in december when outflows reached 26 2 billion according to citigroup chu also believes policymakers will leave china s largest bubbliest sector untouched property that s why it has to return to big sectors like autos even though demand may be weak one of the thing that s striking on the ground in general is that there s weak sentiment in china chu said we are usually facing this situation where foreign investors are more negative than the chinese people we re in the opposite position at the moment they re worrying where their jobs are going and income are going over a 3 year horizon that s one reason why we re seeing weak consumption two ones are won not everyone in china has the same worries though when we break down the flow of credit we see that the collapse has occurred in shadow credit chu said traditional credit which is loans and bonds never pulled back and that goes to soes or state owned entities china s private companies are fairing far worse than those owned by the government policymakers have targeted some stimulus at these companies but private business owners haven t been shy about complaining that these measures have not been enough as soes gobble up struggling private businesses the difference in narratives coming out of the state sector and the private sector is very striking chu said if you were to go to china now and do meetings with soes particularly those involved infrastructure you would walk away from those meetings thinking what slowdown is there why is anyone talking about there being a problem everyone else in china will be waiting for a turnaround in credit conditions which if it does come in a few quarters you will be able to see in deposit data according to chu deposits of m1 the most liquid money supply which includes physical currency and coin demand deposits travelers checks and other checkable deposits increased by an all time low of 1 5 in november according to chu a good five second indicator of whether everything the authorities are doing to ease policy and stimulate credit is working is corporate deposits because every one rmb in credit shows up as a new deposit in a company s bank account until you see that feel free to join the worriers

joão lourenço has been president of angola since 26 september 2017 about one year later he cemented his hold on power by taking over the chairmanship of the ruling movimento popular de libertação de angola mpla although he reshuffled the government for instance by replacing the transport minister and the vice president manuel vicente most other ministerial posts had not changed from the previous administration despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption which he has described as a scourge on society his actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions and declarations past and present lourenço inherited a dire economic situation characterised by serious shortages of foreign currency particularly of the u s dollar and the continual devaluation of the kwanza the currency depreciated 40 per cent against the greenback in 2018 in addition inflation has hovered around 30 per cent and is set to rise angola s economic troubles began in 2014 when global crude oil prices dipped and severely hampered the government s ability to generate revenue angola depends on oil for 75 per cent of its government revenue and 90 per cent of its exports this over dependency on the hydrocarbon sector left the country vulnerable to economic shocks potentially placing the country into an irrecoverable position diversification has long been the answer but execution of a strategy and plan never materialised in the previous administration lourenço s chief election campaign plank centered on reducing the dependency on angola s hydrocarbons sector and creating new revenue streams from existing resources or developing new ones diversification was also a key condition for the international monetary fund imf to agree to a three year extended fund facility for angola worth usd3 7 billion which the creditor announced on 7 december 2018 usd990 million would be immediately disbursed ending corruption including bribery and money laundering was another condition diversification an urgent priority angola is in desperate need of cash and therefore lourenço is pursuing an ambitious investment programme to develop the country s agricultural tourism and mining assets for instance the government is planning to invest usd230 million across the country over the next six years to support its proyecto de desarrollo de agricultura comercial a development initiative launched last december which aims to commercialise the agricultural sector over usd77 million had already been invested in such projects countrywide at the end of 2018 oil majors such as the u k s bp france s total and u s oil giant exxonmobil have also signed memoranda of understanding with the state owned oil company sonangol to develop new ultra deep offshore oil operations however the amount of the investments has not yet been made public a lot of the money for the new investments appears guaranteed by the government against the backdrop of a poor economic outlook coupled with crude oil prices below the levels the government had counted on although brent crude prices rebounded early this year off the back of a production cut agreed by opec member states angola will have to resort to more borrowing thanks to reprofiling of its debt through the issuing of usd5 billion worth of euro and dollar denominated bonds likely explains the reduced fiscal deficit as maturities have been extended in the medium term however debt to gdp remained at a risky 90 per cent at the end of 2018 meaning that more commercial loans will be needed to finance the ambitious investment programme and will continue to damage economic growth prospects not least because china is angola s largest purchaser of oil meanwhile angola already owes beijing a lot of money official figures put this at usd23 billion last year but due to the lack of reliable data this number could be much higher furthermore as a lot of that debt with china has been guaranteed through oil swap deals increased volatility in crude oil prices is likely to again create more financial headaches for the government foreign investors are also likely to be concerned as a growing debt burden will hinder the government s ability to honour its debt repayments and ability to unlock financial resources for instance to pay for projects or salaries to its civil servants anti corruption lourenço also pledged to stamp out corruption which he has described as a scourge on society international observers were positively surprised when he sacked the children of ex president dos santos from key positions within the state owned oil company sonangol and angola s sovereign wealth fund fsdea josé filomeno a son of the former president and former head of fsdea and his business ally dual swiss angolan national jean claude bastos de morais were arrested in angola in september 2018 on charges they had conspired to defraud the state in multiple jurisdictions including in switzerland and the united kingdom both have denied wrongdoing authorities in mauritius switzerland and the u k froze their assets while investigations were ongoing however london s commercial court which is part of its high court lifted the freezing order due to what it said were serious procedural failings in the original complaint notwithstanding and based on a recognition that corruption was conducted with impunity under the previous administration lourenço s government in may last year adopted an amnesty bill for the voluntary repatriation of stolen state funds that had been moved offshore the true extent of angola s corruption problem is unclear but authorities both in angola and the u s have indicated that close to usd30 billion in illicitly obtained money from the state is being held in offshore accounts but the amnesty bill which expired in december appears to have attracted little interest according to legal practitioners on the ground and few actually repatriated any money the government has promised to now coercively go after those who have stolen public funds and hidden it abroad angola s ability to do this remains in doubt repatriation of financial assets will also depend on the willingness of banks abroad to transfer back the money tightening anti money laundering legislation across the world will make commercial banks especially those in oecd countries more averse to high risk jurisdictions like angola diminishing the effectiveness of the law since de risking of angola s banking sector took place after the collapse of portugal s banco espirito santo in part due to toxic credit at its angolan subsidiary hardly any western banks have resumed correspondent banking relationships for transacting in u s dollars which explains a lot of angola s current problems but because oil dependent angola s financial sector is highly dollarised such correspondent banking is also key to repatriate the stolen funds placing doubt about the likely success of lourenço s policies his advisors should be aware of that restoring trust depends on the government s ability to reform the financial sector which remains concentrated around a few politically exposed persons among angolan banks shareholders of the 27 commercial banks registered with banco nacional de angola the central bank and sector regulator five control over 80 per cent of total banking assets deposits and loans in addition the banking sector is highly centralised with the vast majority of angolans and small and medium sized enterprises unable to access formal credit instead the bulk of credit given by angolan banks goes to a few hundred chosen investors given that diversification is a priority of the lourenço presidency his ability to also restructure the financial sector will be critical from reformist to a return to old habits the government s new policies have indeed caught many media headlines but lourenço s own behavior during his first year in office also contradict his narrative it started with lavish spending during a state visit to europe where the angolan delegation signed several agricultural development projects with french financiers among others according to reports on the maka angola news website the angolan delegation went on a spending spree chartering at least three aircraft including a boeing 787 vip private airliner a boeing 737 and a gulfstream business jet according to the leasing company the boeing 787 cost usd74 000 an hour to charter it goes without saying that this sort of spending does not marry well with lourenço s promises and his narrative of being a modest person others have pointed to the lourenço family s real estate property in the town of bethesda maryland united states a report by u s newspaper the washington post citing public records said the property was purchased in 2013 for usd1 7 million by the lourenço family while it is not illegal for angolans to own property abroad as a primary residence such revelations will probably fuel suspicions about the president s true intentions more questions emerge over lourenço s positioning vis à vis the former vice president manuel vicente who portuguese prosecutors in 2017 charged with bribing that country s attorney general in 2011 lourenço refused to recognise the portuguese authorities competency to try vicente and lambasted the charges as interference by the former colonial power it was agreed that vicente would be tried in angola instead this never occurred although vicente has been sidelined from the mpla leadership he remains an influential businessman in both angola and abroad another worrying trend is potential nepotism and conflicts of interest including within the military in april 2018 the president promoted his brother general sequeira joão lourenço as deputy head of the president s intelligence bureau which oversees the military the police and the intelligence services two months prior he allegedly sold a state owned aircraft to his brother s aviation company sjl aeronáutica without a public tender and at an undisclosed price it does not end there his plans to expand the military budget should sound some alarm bells while already having among the largest military budgets on the continent lourenço is intent on expanding it further one reason raised has been to fight piracy as angola is looking to expand its offshore oil production operations and modernizing its naval capabilities would ensure security of such operations against such threats this is despite angola suffering hardly any such attacks in its waters over the past few years although official figures indicate that angola s military budget halved between 2014 and 2017 well respected sweden based think tank sipri has noted that estimates of real military spending are hard to come by across sub saharan africa despite the decline in september 2016 middle east based privinvest group announced on its website that it would provide naval vessels to the angolan navy and construct a ship building facility together with a london based partner around that same time it was revealed that privinvest had signed contracts to supply ships to mozambique which were never delivered the deal along with two others left mozambique with a massive bill of usd2 1 billion more than its total national debt at the time on 29 december south african police arrested manuel chang mozambique s finance minister when the deals with privinvest were signed on suspicion of fraud relating to the deal this followed an indictment by the u s district court of new york city which led to the arrest of jean boustani an executive of privinvest three former bankers of swiss bank credit suisse and a dozen more have also been indicted for their role in the scheme while privinvest was not the only company involved with inflating mozambique s debt to astronomical levels the company has faced resistance in other jurisdictions such as nigeria paris based the africa report revealed in june 2018 that the nigerian finance minister in 2014 had refused to accept a usd2 billion investment proposal from privinvest after it appeared clear that nigeria would have to provide most of the guarantees for the loans that would finance the joint venture privinvest had reportedly proposed to take control over a derelict shipyard from the nigerian navy and refurbish it that angola has signed a deal with privinest under lourenço s watch granted he was defence minister at the time may therefore also concern investors especially since the government never confirmed the investment furthermore in may 2018 credit suisse announced a usd700 million loan to angola conclusion napoleon walks if lourenço is serious about eradicating corruption he should be careful with who he deals with and how this may look to the outside so far his defence scorecard his lavish spending support for vicente and family appointments can only undermine his credibility that the highest ranks of the mpla and the broader governing elite in angola remain intact bar a few cosmetic changes to the political bureau the apex governing body of the mpla is also worrying adopting policies that indeed are likely conditions imposed by international financiers such as the imf but that in reality are unlikely to produce any change in behaviours not only puts his own track record at risk but also the reputation of the entire country furthermore the lack of criminal convictions of former senior officials not only of the former president s family but also other high ranking mpla cadres suggests that their behaviour will not change either the authorities are deliberately delaying the processes to get some initial goodwill from foreign investors or the system is so slow that no conviction will serve to deter future corrupt behaviour the end result is that foreign investors and financiers engaging in angola are setting themselves up to considerable compliance and legal risks giving the new president the benefit of the doubt may have been valid in his first year but the lack of progress should prompt them to adopt a more cautious approach just as napoleon in george orwell s animal farm promised a whole new way of governing once in power he quickly adopted the same habits as his former steward
yves here i ve been disappointed by the cheerleading over the green new deal its claim is that if we mobilize enough resources we can convert to a renewable energy based economy and arrest the rise in greenhouse gases soon enough to prevent the worst global warming outcomes that might have worked if we had started 20 years ago but as they say in maine you can t get there from here the fastest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is radical conservation there is no doubt a lot of low hanging fruit in terms of behavior change particularly by businesses but even if corporations embraced the notion that they need to do something the easy stuff is not likely to make enough difference the false promise of the green new deal is that we can keep our high consumptoin lifestyles a lot of oxen would need to be gored if the public were to cut way back on activities like air travel that do a lot of damage how many people are prepared to fly at most once a year or once every five years to deal with a real emergency and what would that do to jobs and investment portfolios while japan had enough social cohesion to embrace shared sacrifice in its post bubble era executives and top managers took permanent pay cuts to preserve employment that capacity is notably absent in the us by stan cox coxstan is an editor at green social thought he is the author of any way you slice it the past present and future of rationingand with paul cox of how the world breaks life in catastrophe s path from the caribbean to siberia originally published on and was produced by the independent media institute a burgeoning save the climate effort called the green new deal explains vox s david roberts has thrust climate change into the national conversation put house democrats on notice and created an intense and escalating bandwagon effect everyone involved in green politics is talking about the gnd but wtf is it roberts goes on to give a good summary but no one can fully answer that question until someone puts a complete plan down on paper we do know that the vision as it s being described by its fans and it seems to have nothing but fans in the climate movement explicitly draws its inspiration from the new deal that the roosevelt administration launched 85 years ago in an effort to end the great depression a tale of two deals the green new deal would emulate its predecessor s use of public investment and hiring improvement of wages and socioeconomic safety nets to accelerate economic growth and reduce unemployment that part of the vision should be pretty straightforward but in asking whether success in reaching those economic goals could also help head off ecological catastrophe we first need to take into account how the original new deal worked both as a civilian project and as it morphed into the war effort of the 1940s the massive public investment in the civilian economy that began in 1933 carried on through that decade and the war production and recruitment boom of the early 1940s should be seen as an extension of the new deal in part because that turned out to be the spending that finally ended the depression the diversion of money and physical resources into military production necessitated the creation of a war production board that allocated resources between the military and civilian sectors and limited production of specified civilian goods with supplies of consumer goods shrinking and demand steady or rising because thanks to the war people finally had more money to spend the government had to resort to price controls and fair shares rationing then once the war was over both pent up demand and civilian production were unleashed before long the economy was growing rapidly under the green new deal vision investment in renewable energy and infrastructure production would be the mechanism for revving up the economy but whatever shape it takes this new new deal would be born into a very different world from that of its predecessor a world that can t handle a big economic stimulus if we are to avoid climate catastrophe we have to simultaneously bring an end to fossil fuel burning and develop vast renewable energy capacity both starting right now and both on a crash schedule that means the everyday economy must find a way to run on much less available energy analyses purporting to demonstrate otherwise claiming that current and growing energy demand can be met by 100 percent renewable generation rely on overly optimistic technical and environmental assumptions and on the assumption that today s huge disparities in energy consumption among and within countries will remain in place research based on more realistic assumptions shows that neither the united states nor the world can satisfy 100 percent of current let alone projected energy consumption only with renewable sources and there s no way that even a more modest but still adequate introduction of renewable energy could be achieved within a decade or even two quickly phasing out fossil fuels at a time when renewable sources have not yet been phased in affluent nations and communities in particular will have to shrink their total energy consumptiondramatically while shelling out billions to help fund renewable energy in poor nations the green new dealers nevertheless are holding out the promise of prosperity and sustainability through growth without asking where the energy to fuel that growth will come from they predict that with heavy investment in renewable infrastructure the u s economy will expand rapidly so that lower income households can look forward to more better jobs and rising incomes unlike the world war ii stimulus this new green stimulus will not be accompanied by any planned allocation of resources or limits on production and consumption in the private sector but that is what s needed given the necessity for an immediate steep decline in greenhouse emissions and material throughput such planning and limits are needed even more now than they were during world war ii in the 1930s the u s and world economies were vastly smaller than they are today and greenhouse emissions were far lower earthlings all but a tiny handful were blissfully unaware that continued fossil fueled growth would one day become a mortal threat to civilization the original new deal could concern itself only with economic prosperity and justice then a second concern fascism emerged and the productive forces of the economy had to be temporarily transformed the new deal stimulus with its war spending extension brought back prosperity even if material abundance had to be put on pause until the war was over as far as i know no one complained at the time about the 65 percent increase in fossil energy consumption that occurred between 1935 and 1945 thanks to the growing economy even if there had been prophetic scientists within the growing federal bureaucracy of the 1930s sounding the alarm on future global warming that carbon would have had to be spent anyway in order to stop the march of fascism like war production in the 1940s green energy development is an absolute imperative it will also require us to spend emissions in the short run in order to prevent emissions over the long run but the short run the next decade or two is precisely the period when a steep decline in emissions is necessary to stay this side of the dreaded climatic tipping point during those years we won t yet have enough renewable energy capacity to substitute for all of the fossil energy capacity that we need to be eliminating sufficiency for all excess for none the green new deal would not achieve an economic transformation rather it would hitch its sustainable infrastructure investment and taxation reforms to the existing economy it would leave the private sector untethered free to produce for profit rather than for quality of life inevitably pressure would build to crank the dirty energy back up to avoid that disaster we need a strict national emissions ceiling that declines steeply year by year across the economy resources must be diverted by lawaway from destructive and superfluous production toward meeting human needs likewise abuse of land water and ecosystems must be outlawed no matter how much money pain it causes those who ve been enriched by that abuse such limits are what s missing from the green new deal s vision but because it s still a vision and not yet a plan there is still time to conceive a reworked version a new green deal that has a reasonable chance of delivering on both of its goals any effective strategy to drive emissions down to zero cannot also expect to spur aggregate growth it would in fact curtail and even reverse the growth of gdp fortunately well tended conventional wisdom notwithstanding degrowth in america would not necessarily bring on a great depression style social catastrophe the british scholar jason hickel writes that to the contrary ecology busting levels of income and consumption characteristic of rich nations are not necessary in order to maintain their strong social outcomes we can say this because there are a number of countries that are able to achieve equally strong social outcomes with vastly less income and consumption a big laudable goal of the green new deal is to reduce economic inequality we ll have to await the unveiling of the full plan to see the specifics of how that s to be achieved if as is likely its drafters follow the politically palatable well worn but rarely successful equality through growth route their plan will be incompatible with emissions limits tight enough to achieve sufficient emissions reductions what s needed instead is a direct cure for inequality expropriating the wealth of the 1 percenters would be a good start but the necessary transformation will need to go much deeper putting a floor under and a ceiling above individual wealth and income although it really is possible to scale back our economy in a way that improves life for all americans such an effort will face stiff opposition at the top of the economic pyramid the place where the fruits of gdp growth always tend to accumulate that doesn t mean just the 1 percent i have argued that it s the 33 percent of american households with highest incomes who would need to experience the steepest economic degrowth i m talking about adopting but also going way beyond the green new dealers excellent arguments for a more steeply progressive tax structure and their bad arguments for a carbon tax limitations on resources as well as mandatory production of the most necessary rather than the most profitable goods and services will have their greatest dollar impact among the 33 percent which comprises households earning more than about 90 000 annually and within that top one third the greater a household s wealth and income the greater will be the impact because as jesse james would say that s where the money is the impacts will come from several directions an effective climate equality strategy would reduce profits in industries not involved in green energy conversion or production of needed goods and services stock prices of companies not working toward the conversion would fall stockholders owners investors and upper managers the great majority of whom belong to the 33 percent would bear the brunt if shortages and inflation were to strike then allocation of resources could be adjusted and price controls subsidies fair shares rationing and other policies would have to be put in place when and where they are needed that would result in even greater shifts of income and wealth from the top toward the bottom of the economic scale meanwhile the conversion to green energy capacity and infrastructure the costs of which have been optimistically estimated at 15 trillion for the united states alone will be for decades to come a rapidly growing sector of a shrinking overall economy that money will have to come from slashing military appropriations and other wasteful spending as well as wealth financial transaction and inheritance taxes and the green buildout will have to be regulated so that it provides plenty of employment but no profiteering a growing segment of the climate movement rightly recognizes the link between capitalism and greenhouse warming and i think it s safe to say that policies like those i ve described here would be pure poison to a capitalist economy a socialist transformation is necessary but that in itself won t be sufficient to reverse earth s ecological degradation unlessit is also dedicated to drawing the human economy back within necessary ecological limits while ensuring sufficiency for all and excess for none notes in the mainstream climate movement the fundamental problem of falling energy supply during the conversion is generally dismissed by uttering the magic word decarbonization based on wholly unrealistic technological hopes the claim is that energy generation transportation and manufacturing can be accomplished with ever decreasing carbon emissions while sustaining rapid growth decarbonization would be a core principle of a house select committee on the green new deal proposed by alexandria ocasio cortez d ny but research suggesting the possibility of complete or near complete decarbonization at high levels of output has been shown to be highly deficient only a far more modest degree of decarbonization can be achieved within the narrow near future time window in which we must eliminate greenhouse emissions as if that weren t enough decarbonization of energy supplies has been shown to lead to increased energy demand which in turn would lead to a treadmill effect the carbon tax rates that would be required to drive emissions down rapidly enough would be much higher than any rates tried or proposed by anyone so far the tax would have to be brutally heavy even if there were a rebate to compensate low income households and the larger the rebate the more the tax s impact would diminish because people would use that money to pay the taxes necessary to create more emissions meanwhile the affluent would be able to unfairly buy their way out of reducing their own emissions even with a high tax they d whine but they would not give up any more energy than they had to given all that the majority would not stand for the unfairness and would not accept a tax rebate system that s strong enough to be effective

the world bank has added its voice to those warning of a worsening outlook for the global economy this year amid signs that some major economies could experience a recession in its global economic prospects report issued last week entitled darkening skies it stated that storm clouds are brewing for the global economy and contrasted the situation with that of a year ago at the beginning of 2018 the global economy was firing on all cylinders but it lost speed during the year and the ride could get even bumpier ahead the world bank chief executive kristalina georgieva said pointing to the main reasons for the slowdown the bank said international trade and investment had softened trade tensions remain elevated and several large emerging markets experienced substantial financial pressures last year growth in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to remain flat the pickup in economies that rely heavily on commodity exports is likely to be much slower than hoped for and growth in many other economies is anticipated to be decelerate the bank cut its june forecast for global growth of 3 percent this year to 2 9 percent and warned that the risks are growing that growth could be even weaker than anticipated it predicted that growth in world trade will slow to 3 6 percent this year down from 3 8 percent in 2018 and 5 7 percent in 2017 after downgrading its forecasts for global growth last november saying global expansion has peaked the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd issued a series of leading indicators yesterday pointing in the same direction in the united states and germany the tentative signs of easing growth momentum that were flagged in last month s assessment have been confirmed it stated for the third consecutive month the oecd s index for the us was below the 100 mark which points to steady growth and the index for germany was below 100 for the fourth straight month one of the clearest indications of economic weakening comes from europe data published last week showing that eurozone labour productivity had stopped growing for the first time in almost a decade since the financial crisis of 2008 eurozone productivity growth has been around half its previous levels but in the third quarter of last year it dropped to zero compared to the same period in 2017 in germany europe s leading economy it contracted at an annual rate of 0 3 percent the first decline since 2009 industrial production is falling in the main eurozone economies bringing warnings that germany and italy could record a technical recession with a second consecutive contraction in gross domestic production in the final quarter of last year in an editorial comment on saturday the financial times warned that after a staggered economic expansion a bout of nerves is now gripping the major economies in an unhelpfully synchronised wave with signs of trouble in china and the us accompanied by an ever extending period of weakness in the eurozone having chugged along for the past five years the eurozone economy seemed to hit some turbulence in the summer months but more recently data seem to suggest the blip is at risk of turning into a sustained downturn and eurozone growth ended the year very weakly the slowdown is centred in germany economic problems that started to emerge six months ago were initially attributed to the effect of new emissions regulations in the car industry the longer the weakness has continued however the more the slowdown has appeared more fundamental the editorial noted with the most recent data showing german industrial production falling sharply and imports and exports contracting in november another key area of concern is china the stock market fell by 25 percent last year and there are indications that growth rate of 6 5 percent could move down to 6 percent over the next year the china slowdown made a major impact earlier this month for the first time in 16 years apple was forced to cut its sales forecasts for the coming year citing the contracting chinese market and rising trade tensions with the us it led a 660 point fall in wall street s dow index the fall in the sales of iphones is only one indicator of the slowdown in chinese consumption spending which is impacting on all global brands when the final data for last year are issued they are expected to show that car sales in china fell in 2018 for the first time in 28 years the car sector represents about 5 percent of the country s gdp and around 30 percent of the global car market but the significance of china extends far beyond the auto market china accounted for around 16 percent of global gdp last year and over the decade since the global financial crisis has contributed around 30 percent of global growth this has been largely the result of the vast stimulus package initiated by the chinese government and financial authorities in the wake of the 2008 09 global financial crisis but now the government is seeking to rein in credit expansion in order to lower debt levels in the economy at the same time the economic problems to which this gives rise are being compounded by the trade war measures of the us anti china hawks in the trump administration are actively seeking to weaken the chinese economy in order to extract greater concessions in negotiations evidence of the impact of the us trade war measures emerged yesterday when government data revealed that exports had fallen 4 4 percent in december far below the predictions of a 3 percent increase from a poll of economists imports also shrank 7 6 percent against expectations of a 5 percent rise in the us the turbulence in financial markets is giving rise to concerns that a recession is in the making as the prospect of a yield inversion in bond markets draws closer an inversion which occurs when the yield on long term bonds fall below that on shorter term bonds is regarded as an indicator of recession as investors seek a safe haven inversion has not yet occurred but the gap between the yield on two year treasury bonds and of ten year bonds has been narrowing while growth in the rest of the world slowed in 2018 the us continued to advance largely because of the stimulus effect of the corporate tax cuts enacted by the trump administration at the end of the 2017 while trump promised this would boost investment and jobs most of the money went towards share buybacks in an effort to boost equity values and its effect will now start to wear off at least one major investor has countered claims by trump that he is presiding over a strong economy according to jeffrey gundlach the head of doubleline capital lp the us economy is floating on an ocean of debt i m not looking for a terrible economy but an artificially strong one due to stimulus spending he told a forum organised by the investment and financial news service barron s we have floated incremental debt when we should be doing the opposite if the economy is so strong short term economic data are not the only cause for concern a major issue is whether the long term increase in debt which has continued since the global financial crisis and rising geo political tensions will exacerbate the impact of any significant global slowdown in a comment published last week financial times economics correspondent martin wolf wrote that the economy appeared to be heading into what he called a mild cyclical downturn however this was taking place amid profound structural changes characterised by the growth of debt and major political shifts these included the rise of nationalism brexit the election of trump as well as a trade war between the world s two most important economies and an erosion of the liberal global economic order the worry was not over the short term cycle he wrote but rather the context in which such a slowdown might occur it is the political and policy instability combined with the exhaustion of safe options for credit expansion that would make handling even a limited and natural short term slowdown potentially so tricky but he concluded there were no simple mechanisms for reducing these deeply ingrained developments which were more likely to get worse than better

authorâ miguel sanz joã o lourenã o has been president of angola since 26 september 2017 about one year later he cemented his hold on power by taking over the chairmanship of the ruling movimento popular de libertaã ã o de angola mpla although he reshuffled the government for instance by replacing the transport minister and the vice president manuel vicente most other ministerial posts had not changed from the previous administration despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption which he has described as a scourge on society his actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions and declarations past and present lourenã o inherited a dire economic situation characterised by serious shortages of foreign currency particularly of the u s dollar and the continual devaluation of the kwanza the currency depreciated 40 per cent against the greenback in 2018 in addition inflation has hovered around 30 per cent and is set to rise angolaâ s economic troubles began in 2014 when global crude oil prices dipped and severely hampered the governmentâ s ability to generate revenue angola depends on oil for 75 per cent of its government revenue and 90 per cent of its exports this over dependency on the hydrocarbon sector left the country vulnerable to economic shocks potentially placing the country into an irrecoverable position diversification has long been the answer but execution of a strategy and plan never materialised in the previous administration lourenã oâ s chief election campaign plank centered on reducing the dependency on angolaâ s hydrocarbons sector and creating new revenue streams from existing resources or developing new ones diversification was also a key condition for the international monetary fund imf to agree to a three year extended fund facility for angola worth usd3 7 billion which the creditor announced on 7 december 2018 usd990 million would be immediately disbursed ending corruption including bribery and money laundering was another condition diversification an urgent priority angola is in â desperateâ need of cash and therefore lourenã o is pursuing an ambitious investment programme to develop the countryâ s agricultural tourism and mining assets for instance the government is planning to invest usd230 million across the country over the next six years to support its proyectoâ de desarrolloâ deâ agricultura comercial a development initiative launched last december which aims to commercialise the agricultural sector over usd77 million had already been invested in such projects countrywide at the end of 2018 oil majors such as the u k â s bp franceâ s total and u s oil giant exxonmobil have also signed memoranda of understanding with the state owned oil company sonangol to develop new ultra deep offshore oil operations however the amount of the investments has not yet been made public a lot of the money for the new investments appears guaranteed by the government against the backdrop of a poor economic outlook coupled with crude oil prices below the levels the government had counted on â although brent crude prices rebounded early this year off the back of a production cut agreed by opec member states â angola will have to resort to more borrowing thanks to reprofiling of its debt through the issuing of usd5 billion worth of euro and dollar denominated bonds likely explains the reduced fiscal deficit as maturities have been extended in the medium term however debt to gdp remained at a risky 90 per cent at the end of 2018 meaning that more commercial loans will be needed to finance the ambitious investment programme and will continue to damage economic growth prospects not least because china is angolaâ s largest purchaser of oil meanwhile angola already owes beijing a lot of money official figures put this at usd23 billion last year but due to the lack of reliable data this number could be much higher furthermore as a lot of that debt with china has been guaranteed through oil swap deals increased volatility in crude oil prices is likely to again create more financial headaches for the government foreign investors are also likely to be concerned as a growing debt burden will hinder the governmentâ s ability to honour its debt repayments and ability to unlock financial resources for instance to pay for projects or salaries to its civil servants anti corruption lourenã o also pledged to stamp out corruption which he has described as a â scourge on societyâ international observers were positively surprised when he sacked the children of ex president dos santos from key positions within the state owned oil company sonangol and angolaâ s sovereign wealth fund fsdea josã filomeno a son of the former president and former head of fsdea and his business ally dual swiss angolan national jean claude bastos de morais were arrested in angola in september 2018 on charges they had conspired to defraud the state in multiple jurisdictions including in switzerland and the united kingdom both have denied wrongdoing authorities in mauritius switzerland and the u k froze their assets while investigations were ongoing however londonâ s commercial court which is part of its high court lifted the freezing order due to what it said were serious procedural failings in the original complaint notwithstanding and based on a recognition that corruption was conducted with impunity under the previous administration lourenã oâ s government in may last year adopted an amnesty bill for the voluntary repatriation of stolen state funds that had been moved offshore the true extent of angolaâ s corruption problem is unclear but authorities both in angola and the u s have indicated that close to usd30 billion in illicitly obtained money from the state is being held in offshore accounts but the amnesty bill which expired in december appears to have attracted little interest according to legal practitioners on the ground and few actually repatriated any money the government has promised to now coercively go after those who have stolen public funds and hidden it abroad angolaâ s ability to do this remains in doubt repatriation of financial assets will also depend on the willingness of banks abroad to transfer back the money tightening anti money laundering legislation across the world will make commercial banks â especially those in oecd countries â more averse to high risk jurisdictions like angola diminishing the effectiveness of the law since â de riskingâ of angolaâ s banking sector took place after the collapse of portugalâ s banco espirito santo â in part due to toxic credit at its angolan subsidiary â hardly any western banks have resumed correspondent banking relationships for transacting in u s dollars which explains a lot of angolaâ s current problems but because oil dependent angolaâ s financial sector is highly dollarised such correspondent banking is also key to repatriate the stolen funds placing doubt about the likely success of lourenã oâ s policies his advisors should be aware of that restoring trust depends on the government s ability to reform the financial sector which remains concentrated around a few politically exposed persons among angolan banks shareholders of the 27 commercial banks registered with banco nacional de angola â the central bank and sector regulator â five control over 80 per cent of total banking assets deposits and loans in addition the banking sector is highly centralised with the vast majority of angolans and small and medium sized enterprises unable to access formal credit instead the bulk of credit given by angolan banks goes to a few hundred chosen investors given that diversification is a priority of the lourenã o presidency his ability to also restructure the financial sector will be critical from reformist to a return to old habits the governmentâ s new policies have indeed caught many media headlines but lourenã oâ s own behavior during his first year in office also contradict his narrative it started with lavish spending during a state visit to europe where the angolan delegation signed several agricultural development projects with french financiers among others according to reports on the maka angola news website the angolan delegation went on a spending spree chartering at least three aircraft including a boeing 787 vip private airliner a boeing 737 and a gulfstream business jet according to the leasing company the boeing 787 cost usd74 000 an hour to charter it goes without saying that this sort of spending does not marry well with lourenã oâ s promises and his narrative of being a modest person others have pointed to the lourenã o familyâ s real estate property in the town of bethesda maryland united states a report by u s newspaper the washington post citing public records said the property was purchased in 2013 for usd1 7 million by the lourenã o family while it is not illegal for angolans to own property abroad as a primary residence such revelations will probably fuel suspicions about the presidentâ s true intentions more questions emerge over lourenã oâ s positioning vis ã vis the former vice president manuel vicente who portuguese prosecutors in 2017 charged with bribing that countryâ s attorney general in 2011 lourenã o refused to recognise the portuguese authoritiesâ competency to try vicente and lambasted the charges as â interferenceâ by the former colonial power it was agreed that vicente would be tried in angola instead this never occurred although vicente has been sidelined from the mpla leadership he remains an influential businessman in both angola and abroad â another worrying trend is potential nepotism and conflicts of interest including within the military in april 2018 the president promoted his brother â general sequeira joã o lourenã o â as deputy head of the president s intelligence bureau which oversees the military the police and the intelligence services two months prior he allegedly sold a state owned aircraft to his brotherâ s aviation company â sjl aeronã utica â without a public tender and at an undisclosed price it does not end there his plans to expand the military budget should sound some alarm bells while already having among the largest military budgets on the continent lourenã o is intent on expanding it further one reason raised has been to fight piracy as angola is looking to expand its offshore oil production operations and modernizing its naval capabilities would ensure security of such operations against such threats this is despite angola suffering hardly any such attacks in its waters over the past few years although official figures indicate that angolaâ s military budget halved between 2014 and 2017 well respected sweden based think tank sipri has noted that estimates of real military spending are hard to come by across sub saharan africa despite the decline in september 2016 middle east based privinvest group announced on its website that it would provide naval vessels to the angolan navy and construct a ship building facility together with a london based partner around that same time it was revealed that privinvest had signed contracts to supply ships to mozambique which were never delivered the deal along with two others left mozambique with a massive bill of usd2 1 billion â more than its total national debt at the time on 29 december south african police arrested manuel chang mozambiqueâ s finance minister when the deals with privinvest were signed on suspicion of fraud relating to the deal this followed an indictment by the u s district court of new york city which led to the arrest of jean boustani an executive of privinvest three former bankers of swiss bank credit suisse and a dozen more have also been indicted for their role in the scheme while privinvest was not the only company involved with inflating mozambiqueâ s debt to astronomical levels the company has faced resistance in other jurisdictions such as nigeria paris based the africa report revealed in june 2018 that the nigerian finance minister in 2014 had refused to accept a usd2 billion investment proposal from privinvest after it appeared clear that nigeria would have to provide most of the guaranteesâ for the loans that would finance the joint venture privinvest had reportedly proposed to take control over a derelict shipyard from the nigerian navy and refurbish it that angola has signed a deal with privinest under lourenã oâ s watch â granted he was defence minister at the time â may therefore also concern investors especially since the government never confirmed the investment furthermore in may 2018 credit suisse announced a usd700 million loan to angola conclusion napoleon walks if lourenã o is serious about eradicating corruption he should be careful with who he deals with and how this may look to the outside so far his defence scorecard his lavish spending support for vicente and family appointments can only undermine his credibility that the highest ranks of the mpla and the broader governing elite in angola remain intact bar a few cosmetic changes to the political bureau â the apex governing body of the mpla â is also worrying adopting policies that indeed are likely conditions imposed by international financiers such as the imf but that in reality are unlikely to produce any change in behaviours not only puts his own track record at risk but also the reputation of the entire country furthermore the lack of criminal convictions of former senior officials â not only of the former presidentâ s family but also other high ranking mpla cadres â suggests that their behaviour will not change either the authorities are deliberately delaying the processes to get some initial goodwill from foreign investors or the system is so slow that no conviction will serve to deter future corrupt behaviour the end result is that foreign investors and financiers engaging in angola are setting themselves up to considerable compliance and legal risks giving the â newâ president the benefit of the doubt may have been valid in his first year but the lack of progress should prompt them to adopt a more cautious approach just as napoleon in george orwellâ s animal farm promised a whole new way of governing once in power he quickly adopted the same habits as his former steward read more on â
for a period of time from the 1980s to the early 2000s microloans were all the rage in international development the idea was simple enough by giving a very small loan to someone living in a poor country you could help them expand a small business which would lift their family out of poverty when they pay back the loan the money can be cycled to more borrowers getting more families out of poverty organizations offering microcredit to poor borrowers many living on 2 or less per day took off in those decades investors and donors poured money into microcredit hundreds of organizations offered loans and the number of borrowers worldwide skyrocketed to 211 million by 2013 the microcredit movement has been undeniably successful in opening up financial services to poor people across many countries but what has its track record been when it comes to lifting people out of poverty over the past decade this question has occupied researchers who have conducted randomized studies across a variety of countries and settings the findings have not supported the original hope for microcredit they can t find evidence that the loans have been lifting families out of poverty on average many concluded that the classic conception of microcredit was based much more on anecdotes than on robust evidence those results have in turn cooled the development community s enthusiasm for microcredit but does this mean that microcredit has been a failure hardly rather than see microcredit as it was portrayed in its heyday as a way to get people out of poverty we should see it through a different lens as a way to expand options for poor people by offering more reliable financial services extremely poor people need these services just like everyone else and the availability of capital to deal with irregular and at times unpredictable incomes is a huge help to them this benefit along with its impressive growth around the world arguably makes microcredit a success join the vox video lab go behind the scenes chat with creators support vox video become a member of the vox video lab on youtube today heads up you might be asked to sign in to google first while earlier claims about microcredit s benefits were overblown there is mounting evidence that it nonetheless plays a valuable role in improving the lives of people in need financial diaries of people living on 2 or less per day have shown that microcredit helps many families deal with emergencies make critical purchases that they couldn t otherwise afford and put food on the table in times of scarcity while the new story about microcredit isn t the one that propelled it to such heights it s much more grounded in evidence and in many ways it s still inspiring a brief history of microcredit lending money to the poor isn t a new idea in his book due diligence david roodman describes the long history of microcredit going back to jonathan swift yes the author of gulliver s travels who began to lend small amounts to poor people in ireland in the early 1700s even though microcredit isn t new it has long faced some core difficulties one basic issue with lending to extremely poor people is the cost because the loans are often small averaging a few hundred dollars the overhead costs are higher as a proportion of the loan and it s harder to make lending profitable another problem is predicting who will repay a loan in poor communities lending has long taken place locally between people who already knew each other local moneylenders and family friends with social ties that could help ensure repayment another extremely common form of lending has been credit cooperatives in which people often living in the same region and or affiliated through a particular trade could obtain loans but organizations from outside a given community don t have access to information that could help them judge who to lend to on top of that those living on 2 or less per day often do not have collateral to put up as a guarantee for the loan in light of these difficulties lending to the poor wasn t widely seen as promising however that changed in the late 1970s and early 1980s with a new vision of how to offer microcredit to the poor and what it could do for them economist muhammad yunus played a big role in shaping this new perspective in his book banker to the poor yunus describes meeting a woman in bangladesh who was making stools out of bamboo and earned only two cents per day because she had to repay so much money to her bamboo supplier if she had a dependable source of credit yunus thought she and others in similar situations could make their way out of poverty that idea along with his conviction that all human beings are born entrepreneurs led him to found grameen meaning village bank in 1983 he also took the crucial step of convincing outside funders such as the ford foundation that it was a good idea to invest in loans for the very poor the original grameen bank model included a few core elements the first is that after a loan for a microenterprise is granted repayment starts immediately with frequent regular payments over the course of a year or so the second is group loans in which a small group of borrowers from different households receive loans together which then puts pressure on the members to help each other repay finally the model cuts overhead costs by having loan officers hold weekly meetings in villages to collect and disburse payments obviating the need for physical bank branches grameen bank played a big role as a catalyst for microcredit s huge expansion which some called a revolution a huge number of organizations all over the world entered the scene over the next two decades more than 3 000 as reported in 2015 though most borrowers are clustered in a few countries such as india and bangladesh borrowers repay loans to microcredit institutions at very high repayment rates upward of 96 percent on average grameen bank wasn t the first group to take on lending to the poor the nonprofit accion working independently in latin america in the 1970s also developed a similar idea and in bangladesh the nonprofit brac was an early pioneer but it played a critical role in creating a powerful example of how microcredit for the extremely poor can work as roodman writes other groups had done similar things but had never hit on a formula that combined such high repayment rates manageable costs and scalability to millions of people beyond the model for lending yunus also heavily promoted a vision for microcredit s promise that proved hugely influential tim ogden managing director of the financial access initiative says that before grameen bank there was a consensus that it was bad to lend to those living on only a dollar or two per day because it would only trap them in debt after yunus began to talk about loans helping people to exit poverty through micro enterprises there was a huge transformation in the perception of microcredit ogden describes this transformation you re loaning money to a woman who is earning a dollar a day how is that not going to trap her in debt oh she s starting a business and earning more money than i m charging her without this narrative microcredit might not have taken off as it did female empowerment also became integral to the story many microcredit institutions including grameen made it a priority to lend to groups of women about 80 percent of microcredit borrowers are now women investors and donors poured money into microfinance and in 2006 yunus won the nobel peace prize the inspiring narrative falters in the 2000s skepticism about the promise of microcredit started cropping up one concern critics raised was the possibility that some microcredit institutions were harming people in andhra pradesh a state in southeastern india the government issued an ordinance in 2010 essentially shutting down microcredit institutions pointing to over indebtedness the pressure to repay loans and widely reported suicides among borrowers there s also been a long running debate about what level of interest is acceptable versus exploitative on average institutions offer loans at annualized interest rates of around 20 30 percent though some rates are much higher while some people including yunus have argued interest rates above a certain level means that microcredit firms have turned into predatory loan sharks others counter that the rates sometimes have to be high to cover costs of sustainably lending to the poor beyond concern about potential harm researchers started to seriously and publicly question the narrative about microcredit allowing millions of people to get out of poverty from the beginning that story had rested largely on anecdotes from borrowers which might not necessarily be representative there was some more systematic research to back up the claim one of the main studies that supporters pointed to was a study published in 1998 by researchers mark pitt and shahid khandker which claimed that borrowers especially women were getting out of poverty at significant rates in bangladesh however when jonathan morduch and david roodman reanalyzed the study they found issues that made them question the reliability of the results morduch first commented on the original study which led to a series of replies and replies to the replies that continued for a period of more than 15 years this along with the lack of other rigorous studies meant that there was a big evidence gap for the first few decades of microcredit s expansion over the past decade there s been an influx of more systematic evidence on microcredit randomized controlled trials rcts are a particularly good method for gauging impact since they make it easier to distinguish causation from correlation the most recent six microcredit studies published in 2015 were conducted by economists working independently across six countries the studies found fairly consistent results none found evidence that income went up on average among those offered credit a few saw modest positive effects such as people choosing to spend more time on their small businesses and some changes in spending habits abhijit banerjee jonathan zinman and dean karlan sum up the studies concluding we note a consistent pattern of modestly positive but not transformative effects not the result that many people had hoped for but in some ways the findings were also good news for one thing they countered the backlash that had been brewing against microcredit some critics argued that microcredit hadn t just failed to lift people out of poverty it was in fact even systematically harming people by trapping them in debt but the rcts didn t find systematic evidence of this claim for another thing these results are only a disappointment if one thought that microcredit would get most participants out of poverty to be sure this was a common belief but many researchers say that that hope wasn t realistic to begin with in a recent discussion about the history of microcredit economist bruce wydick compared microcredit in poor countries to introducing credit cards in rich countries as a way of explaining why we shouldn t be surprised when they introduced credit cards in the us so that almost everybody had access to a credit line did that pull millions of people out of poverty no wydick says but just because it doesn t pull most borrowers out of poverty doesn t mean microcredit hasn t helped people for evidence of microcredit s value look at how it helps the poor live day to day so how does microcredit help people if not by raising their incomes on average research that looks closely at the financial lives of people living on 2 or less per day such as the work of researchers daryl collins jonathan morduch stuart rutherford and orlanda ruthven in portfolios of the poor shows that credit often plays a crucial role in borrowers lives part of that story is that people very often use microcredit for their day to day needs rather than for business loans as yunus had originally envisioned they may have a need for cash to meet emergencies or for a big purchase or even just to provide an inflow of money to put food on the table when income fluctuates and microcredit helps to meet that need in fact microcredit organizations are far from the only source of credit people often take small loans from friends and family or from local shopkeepers for example but a really valuable aspect of microcredit is its reliability people can depend on getting a loan at a certain time then commit to the small regular repayments so that they can get a further loan as jonathan morduch writes incomes are seldom steady and predictable needs vary as well families need to pay for schools medicines and food during slow periods evidence that microfinance loans are used to fund non business needs even if for education or health is sometimes used to criticize microfinance but that misses the point poor families like richer families need broad financial tools in fact the poor may need them more urgently there are also other potential benefits of increasing access to credit in due diligence roodman also points to nobel laureate economist amartya sen s view about the value of increased freedom in the sense of greater agency in one s life by giving the poor a greater number of options in how to navigate their financial lives roodman suggests microcredit can increase this kind of freedom roodman emphasizes that the details matter some ways of offering microcredit might offer more freedom than others for example he writes that group microcredit emerges in a surprisingly negative light when looking at financial diaries groups that are responsible for each other s loans can generate peer support in times of difficulty or peer pressure to pay no matter what there s also some evidence from a study in the philippines by economists xavier giné and dean karlan that group liability might not be necessary to achieve high repayment rates over time some institutions have moved toward individual loans instead while still keeping the group meetings finally there s evidence that suggests that microcredit may be playing a broader positive role for example economists emily breza and cynthia kinnan studied what happened in andhra pradesh india when microcredit institutions were shut down in 2010 they found that this was followed by a notable decrease in wages in rural areas they write that this result shows that microfinance despite its small loan sizes can have meaningful impacts on rural economies it also suggests that the full picture of microcredit isn t captured in studies that only look at individual borrowers now what about cost recent research from the world bank has shown that the vast majority of microfinance is subsidized in the sense that investors and donors are providing capital at below market rates to the extent that the classic story included the claim that a lot of microcredit institutions would eventually sustain themselves without subsidy it hasn t turned out to be true in that regard either however the subsidy isn t so expensive amounting to a median of around 25 per borrower so to sum it all up microcredit seems to be very important in the lives of the poor even if it s not transformative given that it comes at a relatively low cost it may be that microcredit is quite a cost effective way to help people comparing microcredit to other ways of helping people all this said some readers may want practical advice should they contribute to microcredit institutions this raises its own set of tough questions what is the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of microcredit compared to other potential ways to help extremely poor people including just giving cash how much should an investor or donor be worried about harm to some borrowers how much room for more funding do microcredit institutions now have and which ones are the most cost effective on the one hand it s useful to consult a review by nonprofit charity evaluator givewell which does not recommend microfinance institutions as among the best options for donors looking to accomplish as much good as possible givewell notes that microfinance is far from a failure but finds the evidence for the benefits of cash transfers to be clearer and expresses concern about potential harm to some microcredit borrowers full disclosure i have worked for givewell in the past on the other hand some researchers who have looked closely at microcredit and who have done work to compare the costs and benefits of microcredit compared to other programs to help the poor including economists jonathan morduch asli demirgüç kunt and robert cull argue that it could very still well be in the running when compared to other programs a big reason for this is the low cost of subsidies for microcredit which could make the program cost effective in spite of modest average benefits it s an open question morduch told me how microcredit fares when compared to other programs such as cash transfers adding that there should be more serious comparative cost benefit work it s also worth making a final point while rcts haven t found that microcredit raises incomes for average borrowers there is a small group of people who do achieve higher business profitability when they receive loans and sometimes these returns are really impressive far exceeding interest rates in one study researchers referred to this group as gung ho entrepreneurs as opposed to reluctant ones so an ongoing research question would be whether it s possible to find ways to better target people when offering loans for business or whether tweaking the terms of the loans might improve business profits whether or not one concludes that microcredit beats cash transfers or other ways to help the poor there s still reason to believe that microcredit has done and continues to do a lot of good at fairly low cost beyond that there s reason to believe that there may be ways to make small loans as well as broader financial services such as micro savings and micro insurance even more useful to those living on very low incomes to some the new vision of microcredit helping poor people to better face their financial challenges may not hold the simple allure of the old one but the researchers who wrote portfolios of the poor and looked closely at the lives of those living on 2 per day find the new narrative inspiring nonetheless whether or not the microfinance movement was right to stress loans for microenterprises or has been too slow to embrace savings and other services its greatest contribution is to us beyond dispute it represents a huge step in the process of bringing reliability to the financial lives of poor households the story of microcredit illustrates that even where a program doesn t live up to the hype it can still be

authorâ miguel sanz joã o lourenã o has been president of angola since 26 september 2017 about one year later he cemented his hold on power by taking over the chairmanship of the ruling movimento popular de libertaã ã o de angola mpla although he reshuffled the government for instance by replacing the transport minister and the vice president manuel vicente most other ministerial posts had not changed from the previous administration despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption which he has described as a scourge on society his actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions and declarations past and present lourenã o inherited a dire economic situation characterised by serious shortages of foreign currency particularly of the u s dollar and the continual devaluation of the kwanza the currency depreciated 40 per cent against the greenback in 2018 in addition inflation has hovered around 30 per cent and is set to rise angolaâ s economic troubles began in 2014 when global crude oil prices dipped and severely hampered the governmentâ s ability to generate revenue angola depends on oil for 75 per cent of its government revenue and 90 per cent of its exports this over dependency on the hydrocarbon sector left the country vulnerable to economic shocks potentially placing the country into an irrecoverable position diversification has long been the answer but execution of a strategy and plan never materialised in the previous administration lourenã oâ s chief election campaign plank centered on reducing the dependency on angolaâ s hydrocarbons sector and creating new revenue streams from existing resources or developing new ones diversification was also a key condition for the international monetary fund imf to agree to a three year extended fund facility for angola worth usd3 7 billion which the creditor announced on 7 december 2018 usd990 million would be immediately disbursed ending corruption including bribery and money laundering was another condition diversification an urgent priority angola is in â desperateâ need of cash and therefore lourenã o is pursuing an ambitious investment programme to develop the countryâ s agricultural tourism and mining assets for instance the government is planning to invest usd230 million across the country over the next six years to support its proyectoâ de desarrolloâ deâ agricultura comercial a development initiative launched last december which aims to commercialise the agricultural sector over usd77 million had already been invested in such projects countrywide at the end of 2018 oil majors such as the u k â s bp franceâ s total and u s oil giant exxonmobil have also signed memoranda of understanding with the state owned oil company sonangol to develop new ultra deep offshore oil operations however the amount of the investments has not yet been made public a lot of the money for the new investments appears guaranteed by the government against the backdrop of a poor economic outlook coupled with crude oil prices below the levels the government had counted on â although brent crude prices rebounded early this year off the back of a production cut agreed by opec member states â angola will have to resort to more borrowing thanks to reprofiling of its debt through the issuing of usd5 billion worth of euro and dollar denominated bonds likely explains the reduced fiscal deficit as maturities have been extended in the medium term however debt to gdp remained at a risky 90 per cent at the end of 2018 meaning that more commercial loans will be needed to finance the ambitious investment programme and will continue to damage economic growth prospects not least because china is angolaâ s largest purchaser of oil meanwhile angola already owes beijing a lot of money official figures put this at usd23 billion last year but due to the lack of reliable data this number could be much higher furthermore as a lot of that debt with china has been guaranteed through oil swap deals increased volatility in crude oil prices is likely to again create more financial headaches for the government foreign investors are also likely to be concerned as a growing debt burden will hinder the governmentâ s ability to honour its debt repayments and ability to unlock financial resources for instance to pay for projects or salaries to its civil servants anti corruption lourenã o also pledged to stamp out corruption which he has described as a â scourge on societyâ international observers were positively surprised when he sacked the children of ex president dos santos from key positions within the state owned oil company sonangol and angolaâ s sovereign wealth fund fsdea josã filomeno a son of the former president and former head of fsdea and his business ally dual swiss angolan national jean claude bastos de morais were arrested in angola in september 2018 on charges they had conspired to defraud the state in multiple jurisdictions including in switzerland and the united kingdom both have denied wrongdoing authorities in mauritius switzerland and the u k froze their assets while investigations were ongoing however londonâ s commercial court which is part of its high court lifted the freezing order due to what it said were serious procedural failings in the original complaint notwithstanding and based on a recognition that corruption was conducted with impunity under the previous administration lourenã oâ s government in may last year adopted an amnesty bill for the voluntary repatriation of stolen state funds that had been moved offshore the true extent of angolaâ s corruption problem is unclear but authorities both in angola and the u s have indicated that close to usd30 billion in illicitly obtained money from the state is being held in offshore accounts but the amnesty bill which expired in december appears to have attracted little interest according to legal practitioners on the ground and few actually repatriated any money the government has promised to now coercively go after those who have stolen public funds and hidden it abroad angolaâ s ability to do this remains in doubt repatriation of financial assets will also depend on the willingness of banks abroad to transfer back the money tightening anti money laundering legislation across the world will make commercial banks â especially those in oecd countries â more averse to high risk jurisdictions like angola diminishing the effectiveness of the law since â de riskingâ of angolaâ s banking sector took place after the collapse of portugalâ s banco espirito santo â in part due to toxic credit at its angolan subsidiary â hardly any western banks have resumed correspondent banking relationships for transacting in u s dollars which explains a lot of angolaâ s current problems but because oil dependent angolaâ s financial sector is highly dollarised such correspondent banking is also key to repatriate the stolen funds placing doubt about the likely success of lourenã oâ s policies his advisors should be aware of that restoring trust depends on the government s ability to reform the financial sector which remains concentrated around a few politically exposed persons among angolan banks shareholders of the 27 commercial banks registered with banco nacional de angola â the central bank and sector regulator â five control over 80 per cent of total banking assets deposits and loans in addition the banking sector is highly centralised with the vast majority of angolans and small and medium sized enterprises unable to access formal credit instead the bulk of credit given by angolan banks goes to a few hundred chosen investors given that diversification is a priority of the lourenã o presidency his ability to also restructure the financial sector will be critical from reformist to a return to old habits the governmentâ s new policies have indeed caught many media headlines but lourenã oâ s own behavior during his first year in office also contradict his narrative it started with lavish spending during a state visit to europe where the angolan delegation signed several agricultural development projects with french financiers among others according to reports on the maka angola news website the angolan delegation went on a spending spree chartering at least three aircraft including a boeing 787 vip private airliner a boeing 737 and a gulfstream business jet according to the leasing company the boeing 787 cost usd74 000 an hour to charter it goes without saying that this sort of spending does not marry well with lourenã oâ s promises and his narrative of being a modest person others have pointed to the lourenã o familyâ s real estate property in the town of bethesda maryland united states a report by u s newspaper the washington post citing public records said the property was purchased in 2013 for usd1 7 million by the lourenã o family while it is not illegal for angolans to own property abroad as a primary residence such revelations will probably fuel suspicions about the presidentâ s true intentions more questions emerge over lourenã oâ s positioning vis ã vis the former vice president manuel vicente who portuguese prosecutors in 2017 charged with bribing that countryâ s attorney general in 2011 lourenã o refused to recognise the portuguese authoritiesâ competency to try vicente and lambasted the charges as â interferenceâ by the former colonial power it was agreed that vicente would be tried in angola instead this never occurred although vicente has been sidelined from the mpla leadership he remains an influential businessman in both angola and abroad â another worrying trend is potential nepotism and conflicts of interest including within the military in april 2018 the president promoted his brother â general sequeira joã o lourenã o â as deputy head of the president s intelligence bureau which oversees the military the police and the intelligence services two months prior he allegedly sold a state owned aircraft to his brotherâ s aviation company â sjl aeronã utica â without a public tender and at an undisclosed price it does not end there his plans to expand the military budget should sound some alarm bells while already having among the largest military budgets on the continent lourenã o is intent on expanding it further one reason raised has been to fight piracy as angola is looking to expand its offshore oil production operations and modernizing its naval capabilities would ensure security of such operations against such threats this is despite angola suffering hardly any such attacks in its waters over the past few years although official figures indicate that angolaâ s military budget halved between 2014 and 2017 well respected sweden based think tank sipri has noted that estimates of real military spending are hard to come by across sub saharan africa despite the decline in september 2016 middle east based privinvest group announced on its website that it would provide naval vessels to the angolan navy and construct a ship building facility together with a london based partner around that same time it was revealed that privinvest had signed contracts to supply ships to mozambique which were never delivered the deal along with two others left mozambique with a massive bill of usd2 1 billion â more than its total national debt at the time on 29 december south african police arrested manuel chang mozambiqueâ s finance minister when the deals with privinvest were signed on suspicion of fraud relating to the deal this followed an indictment by the u s district court of new york city which led to the arrest of jean boustani an executive of privinvest three former bankers of swiss bank credit suisse and a dozen more have also been indicted for their role in the scheme while privinvest was not the only company involved with inflating mozambiqueâ s debt to astronomical levels the company has faced resistance in other jurisdictions such as nigeria paris based the africa report revealed in june 2018 that the nigerian finance minister in 2014 had refused to accept a usd2 billion investment proposal from privinvest after it appeared clear that nigeria would have to provide most of the guaranteesâ for the loans that would finance the joint venture privinvest had reportedly proposed to take control over a derelict shipyard from the nigerian navy and refurbish it that angola has signed a deal with privinest under lourenã oâ s watch â granted he was defence minister at the time â may therefore also concern investors especially since the government never confirmed the investment furthermore in may 2018 credit suisse announced a usd700 million loan to angola conclusion napoleon walks if lourenã o is serious about eradicating corruption he should be careful with who he deals with and how this may look to the outside so far his defence scorecard his lavish spending support for vicente and family appointments can only undermine his credibility that the highest ranks of the mpla and the broader governing elite in angola remain intact bar a few cosmetic changes to the political bureau â the apex governing body of the mpla â is also worrying adopting policies that indeed are likely conditions imposed by international financiers such as the imf but that in reality are unlikely to produce any change in behaviours not only puts his own track record at risk but also the reputation of the entire country furthermore the lack of criminal convictions of former senior officials â not only of the former presidentâ s family but also other high ranking mpla cadres â suggests that their behaviour will not change either the authorities are deliberately delaying the processes to get some initial goodwill from foreign investors or the system is so slow that no conviction will serve to deter future corrupt behaviour the end result is that foreign investors and financiers engaging in angola are setting themselves up to considerable compliance and legal risks giving the â newâ president the benefit of the doubt may have been valid in his first year but the lack of progress should prompt them to adopt a more cautious approach just as napoleon in george orwellâ s animal farm promised a whole new way of governing once in power he quickly adopted the same habits as his former steward read more on â
talk of separation is in the air in alberta triggered by the plight of the province s beleaguered oil sands industry the focus of the angst is the alleged indifference of prime minister justin trudeau s federal government to the industry s circumstances especially the failure to proceed with the trans mountain pipeline expansion to the british columbia coast that would diversify exports beyond the united states and help relieve the huge price differential undercutting the value of the resource columnist don braid claims it is an honest to goodness fact that trudeau wants to wind down fossil fuel production investor brett wilson believes alberta is being pushed out of confederation and declares current coffee shop polling is running 99 per cent in favour of getting out of canada freedom conservative party leader derek fildebrandt says his party will make equality or independence a focus of its platform for the next provincial election jack mintz former director of the university of calgary s school of public policy asserts that alberta s succession from canada would be easier to justify than the uk s attempt to exit the european union given the existential threat to the province s prosperity it is true that trudeau s ultimate aim is to phase out fossil fuels but that was also the professed goal of his predecessor stephen harper who joined other g7 members in 2015 in committing to halt use of non renewable energy by the end of the century trudeau sees natural resource development as a way to fund a gradual shift to a low carbon economy his government has spent 4 5 billion to buy the trans mountain expansion from kinder morgan the previous owner the current delay in proceeding with the project was brought about by the federal court of appeal which ruled that indigenous communities had not been adequately consulted and the national energy board had failed to consider the impact on west coast tanker traffic the federal government and the board are playing catch up on both fronts ottawa is also offering the oil industry 1 6 billion in short term assistance there is scant evidence that albertans want to separate from canada public opinion surveys put support for independence at 25 per cent about the same as it has been in recent years still mintz seems to think the idea makes sense whatever negatives alberta would face are easily swamped by the positives that would come with separation an independent alberta he says could choose its own policies on oil and gas the environment taxes health care and pensions and pursue its own trade relations with the rest of canada and the united states as it sees fit he allows that hard borders and canadian trade barriers would be a cost and that negotiating alberta s share of the national debt would be contentious but alberta would have a cushion in the form of a repatriated 20 billion in taxes it sends to ottawa each year over and above what ottawa spends in alberta mintz leaves a host of subjects off the list including such critical matters as diplomacy security and defence tristin hopper points out that an independent alberta would no longer have access to free trade agreements treaties alliances and membership in international organizations such as the world trade organization and the united nations in which canada participates in a nightmare scenario hopper adds alberta would celebrate its first independence day without trade agreements of any kind how would succession take place and how would an independent alberta fare in a world of sovereign states domestically any referendum on independence would be subject to the terms of the clarity act adopted in the wake of the failed 1995 quebec referendum which requires an unambiguous question and clear majority support followed by negotiations with the federal government and the other provinces bargaining would be tough and complicated the new responsibilities an independent alberta would be required to take on would increase the size and scope of government activity its public sector costs already the highest in canada would grow even higher an independent alberta would also have to be recognized by other countries none of which is more important than the united states the united states is alberta s most important external relationship starting with their shared 298 km border americans account for some 80 per cent of the province s international exports more than 65 per cent of its foreign imports over 65 per cent of its foreign investment and 60 per cent of its foreign tourists although relations have generally been positive there is no reason to assume americans would welcome an independent alberta as two quebec referenda demonstrated they have an inherent bias against succession based on their civil war experience and have repeatedly expressed their preference for a united canada this stance has been reinforced and magnified by the 9 11 terrorist attacks on the united states which have made border security a virtual obsession forcing canada to invest heavily in security measures to ensure the uninterrupted flow of trade and transit between the two countries an independent alberta would have to make similar investments a sovereign alberta would not automatically accede to nafta or other canada us arrangements to which canada is a party it would be forced to enter into its own negotiations with the united states the results of which would not be assured for example would montana cattle producers and their political allies press for a ban on canadian beef as they did in an attempt to capture the us market for themselves following alberta s mad cow disease scare how would an independent alberta fare in the ongoing softwood lumber dispute between the two countries the united states being alberta s biggest customer it is hard to see how achieving independence would make pipeline approvals easier though opposed by british columbia trans mountain has the support of the federal government and survived other court challenges before the setback in the federal court of appeal absent that support and recourse to the courts british columbia s leverage would likely grow neither canada nor alberta has any role in the us pipeline approval process in which washington sanctions international pipelines and state regulators authorize routes enbridge s line 3 replacement pipeline from alberta to wisconsin is currently under siege in minnesota where the state s department of commerce has joined environmental groups and native communities in challenging the public utilities commission s endorsement in the courts the keystone xl pipeline project from alberta to the us gulf coast was approved by the trump administration in 2017 but it is on hold in montana where a federal judge has blocked the project pending further environmental review an independent alberta would not change a thing albertans frustration with the lack of pipeline access is understandable alberta introduced strong environmental measures and won the previous british columbia government s support for trans mountain only to have the current government oppose it while pursuing new energy projects of its own the premier of quebec whose province is the main beneficiary of canada s equalization program to which alberta is a major contributor adds insult to injury commenting that he s not ashamed at all of refusing dirty energy ottawa s attempts to balance competing provincial interests with those of the energy industry environmentalists and indigenous communities have often been inept but even though the process is messy the odds are that trans mountain will be approved working within canada will yield bigger payoffs than going it alone donald barry is a professor emeritus of political science at the university of calgary he has written widely on canadian foreign policy
can as u s president donald trump has suggested the united states devastate turkey economically probably economic sanctions are more powerful when targeted at allies than adversaries because there are more and more important economic ties between allies for example the united states is turkey s fourth largest source of imports and fifth largest source of exports just two measures of the links between the turkish and u s economies u s economic power was on full display last summer trump threatened via tweet large sanctions unless turkey released a u s clergyman implausibly accused of involvement in turkey s failed 2016 coup attempt immediately the turkish lira fell 4 5 percent against the dollar after the administration sanctioned two turkish cabinet ministers an unprecedented step against allied senior officials the lira fell another 10 percent what happened next was even weirder than sanctioning an ally rather than responding to a potential currency crisis with well developed tools to stabilize the situation and prevent the spread of financial instability to other emerging markets trump announced that the united states would double tariffs on turkish steel and aluminum again by tweet replete with gloating about the lira moving rapidly downward against our very strong dollar the lira s slide turned into a rout with the currency dropping more than 18 percent in a single day jarrett blanc jarrett blanc was a senior fellow in the geoeconomics and strategy program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more the united states did not push the issue further the u s clergyman was released and the lira stabilized in the meantime the cost of borrowing increased confidence decreased and growth slowed dramatically from 5 3 percent in the second quarter to 1 6 percent in the third why is turkey s economy so susceptible to u s sanctions this story reflects the fragility of turkey s economy turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan has become increasingly autocratic and eccentric he has grabbed power from turkey s nominally independent central bank and has insisted on keeping interest rates down despite increasing inflation a problem given the turkish private sector s dependence on foreign debt in foreign currencies his attacks on institutions after the failed 2016 coup ranging from the courts to the press to schools have reduced confidence in the country as a business partner and investment target appointing his forty year old son in law finance minister in july only aggravated the business community s fears under these conditions the united states could do damage with a couple of sanctions and a tariff announcement it has many more sanctions and other corrosive economic tools available should it choose to use them what would be the turkish response are there any negative economic or political consequences for the united states turkey can respond to u s pressure with a range of political steps anything from refusing to cooperate on policies toward syria iraq or iran to limiting operations at i̇ncirlik air base where the united states inexplicably stores nuclear weapons and there is always the unforeseen when the united states sanctioned the turkish ministers of justice and the interior in august washington could not have imagined that it would depend on turkish security and law enforcement agencies to understand saudi arabia s murder of journalist and u s resident jamal khashoggi in october more than this though there is the risk of overreach in u s sanctions policy forcing allies and partners to find ways to work around the u s banking system officials in europe and other global economic powers are already nervous that the united states is abusing its dominant banking position with capricious sanctions on iran russia and others targeting a nato ally will surely push partners and adversaries to look harder for financial structures that bypass the united states and minimize the risks associated with u s sanctions
