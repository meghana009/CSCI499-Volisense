this chart book will not be updated with new data for economic growth and labor market developments beyond the period covered here see the tracking the recovery from the pandemic recession chart book note the business cycle dating committee of the national bureau of economic research nber the acknowledged arbiter of business cycle dating describes a recession as the period between a peak of economic activity and its subsequent trough or lowest point involv a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months an expansion is the period from a trough to its subsequent peak or highest point the committee announced on june 8 2020 that the economic expansion following the trough in june 2009 peaked in february 2020 on july 19 2021 it announced that the trough of the ensuing recession was in april 2020 while the recession was very deep it was the shortest on record at just two months the committee noted that this recession had different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions but nonetheless the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production and its broad reach across the economy warranted the designation of this episode as a recession even though the downturn was briefer than earlier contractions on a quarterly basis the nber dated the previous peak as the fourth quarter of 2019 and the latest trough as the second quarter of 2020 when president trump took office in january 2017 he inherited an economy in its 91st month of economic expansion following the end of the great recession in june 2009 that expansion continued into 2020 becoming the longest on record but peaked at 128 months in february 2020 the current expansion which began following the april 2020 trough reached 24 months in april while the post great recession expansion was long both the economy s average annual growth rate and the typical worker s earnings gains were relatively modest by the standards of earlier long expansions former president trump claimed that his policies would produce a substantial and sustained increase in economic growth and his council of economic advisers claimed that those policies would boost wages and employment substantially by contrast the congressional budget office cbo and many other non partisan analysts projected much slower economic growth and smaller increases in most workers earnings this chart book documents the 2009 2020 economic expansion and will continue to track the evolution of the economy it supplants its predecessor the legacy of the great recession which covers the decade from the start of the recession in december 2007 through december 2017 with a focus on the plunge into and recovery from the great recession part i covid 19 ended long recovery and expansion after the great recession economic growth from mid 2009 into early 2020 ended abruptly after contracting sharply in the great recession the economy began growing in mid 2009 following the enactment of the financial stabilization bill troubled asset relief program or tarp and the american recovery and reinvestment act economic growth averaged 2 3 percent per year from mid 2009 through 2019 the pattern of quarterly growth was uneven with the expansion including several quarters of growth well above 3 5 percent but also three quarters where it was negative the onset of covid 19 produced a sharp contraction in economic activity in march 2020 resulting in a decline in real gdp of 5 1 percent at an annual rate in the year s first quarter and 31 2 percent in the second quarter because gdp was so much lower in the second quarter than it was at the end of 2019 the dollar amount of the 33 8 annualized growth in the third quarter was much smaller than the dollar amount of the second quarter drop growth slowed to a 4 5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 a reopening of businesses and government relief and stimulus actions fueled the ongoing recovery in the first quarter of 2021 when gdp rose by 6 3 percent but was still 0 8 percent below its level at the peak of the last expansion in the fourth quarter of 2019 growth of 6 7 percent in the second quarter pushed gdp 0 9 percent above that previous peak after relatively weak growth in the third quarter gdp rose at a robust 6 9 percent annual rate in the fourth putting gdp 5 5 percent above its level a year earlier and 3 1 percent above its previous peak real gdp fell 1 4 percent in the first quarter of 2022 but for reasons that did not suggest a recession was underway gdp is a measure of current domestic production of goods and services imports are goods and services produced abroad and are subtracted from domestically produced consumption and investment in calculating gdp inventory accumulation when production exceeds sales adds to gdp which it did in the fourth quarter of 2021 inventory decumulation when sales exceed production reduces gdp which it did in the first quarter of 2022 in the first quarter real consumer purchases added 1 8 percentage points to gdp growth and business and residential investment added 1 3 points but the trade deficit the excess of imports over exports subtracted 3 2 points a decrease in inventories subtracted 0 8 points and a drop in government purchases subtracted 0 5 points with the 1 4 percent drop gdp in the first quarter of 2022 was 3 6 percent higher than it was a year earlier and 2 8 percent above its pre pandemic peak in the fourth quarter of 2019 employment growth has resumed after covid 19 losses wiped out large share of 2010 2019 gains through february 2020 total private and government payroll employment had risen for 113 straight months private employment had risen for 120 straight months but total government employment was barely above what it was at the start of the expansion large employment losses in march and april 2020 wiped out a large share of those gains total nonfarm employment fell by a staggering 20 7 million jobs in april 2020 largely erasing the gains from a decade of job growth job gains in every month except december 2020 have narrowed the deficit in april 2022 to 1 2 million jobs below the pre pandemic february 2020 level private employment rose by 406 000 jobs in april 2022 but remains 500 000 jobs below its february 2020 level federal government employment decreased by 6 000 state employment increased by 7 000 putting losses since february 2020 at 103 000 and local employment rose by 21 000 putting losses since february 2020 at 596 000 note every january the bureau of labor statistics publishes revised figures for payroll employment data based on a re benchmarking of the previous march s estimates using administrative data rather than a survey the revisions changed the pattern of monthly growth substantially and increased average monthly growth in 2021 from 537 000 per month to 555 000 per month job growth greater than in 2001 2007 expansion ended in march 2020 nonfarm payroll employment fell more sharply in the great recession than in the three prior recessions in contrast to the rapid bounce back in employment at the start of the 1980s expansion the turnaround in the labor market trailed the revival of economic activity marking the beginning of the three expansions prior to the 2020 recession job gains starting in may 2020 have been very large by historical standards but have not yet brought total employment back to its february 2020 level in the pandemic the drop in payroll employment in april 2020 was huge and the turnaround in payroll employment in the months since then reflected some lifting of pandemic restrictions in many states and some people returning to work in may and june 2020 but states facing outbreaks began re imposing restrictions and payroll job growth slowed for five straight months prior to falling by 227 000 jobs in december 2020 policymakers enacted relief measures at the end of december 2020 and the american rescue plan in march 2021 which together with some opening up of the economy produced job gains averaging 562 000 a month in 2021 although health and safety concerns arising from the delta and omicron variants were a barrier to job creation later in the year looking back at the 2009 2020 expansion the jobs deficit at the beginning was much larger than those at the start of the previous two expansions and it took a long time simply to get back to the level of payroll employment at the start of the recession that said payroll employment growth was somewhat better than in the 2001 2007 expansion and it continued much longer nonfarm payroll employment was 10 2 percent 14 1 million jobs higher in february 2020 than at the start of the great recession but due to the job losses since in april 2022 such employment was just 9 3 percent 12 9 million jobs higher than at the start of the great recession the rise in payroll employment over its peak in the expansion preceding the great recession was almost entirely due to private sector job gains government employment was 459 000 jobs 2 1 percent higher in february 2020 than in december 2007 accounting for only 3 2 percent of the total job gains in contrast government employment in the three expansions preceding the great recession accounted for 13 percent 1982 1990 10 percent 1991 2001 and 25 percent 2001 2007 of each expansion s employment gains over the level of employment at the peak of the previous expansion in each case state and local government job growth was the major contributor unemployment fell slowly in post great recession expansion but reached rates lower than in 1990s before spiking in covid 19 recession the relatively modest pace of job growth in the first years of the 2009 2020 expansion compared with the size of the job losses in the recession kept unemployment quite high for some time after economic activity picked up this initial persistence of high unemployment was similar to but more extreme than what happened at the start of the two previous expansions the pattern in all three however is quite different from the sharp decline in unemployment at the start of most earlier expansions including the expansion following the severe 1981 1982 recession nevertheless by late 2015 the unemployment rate had fallen to 5 percent its rate at the start of the recession and it began to fall further at the beginning of 2017 the unemployment rate was 4 percent or lower for the last 24 months of the expansion it was in the 3 5 percent to 3 7 percent range from april 2019 through february 2020 reaching rates even lower than in the long 1990s expansion rates that low were last seen in 1969 the rise in unemployment since february 2020 however pushed the unemployment rate well above the 10 8 percent rate reached in late 1982 which itself was the highest since the 1930s unemployment has come down sharply after peaking in april 2020 reaching 3 6 percent in april 2022 the bureau of labor statistics says the actual rate likely is somewhat higher due to misclassification of some workers in addition the unemployment rate does not take into account workers who have stopped looking for work and left the labor force unlike the unemployment rate labor force participation the share of the population age 16 and over either working or actively looking for work has only recently begun to edge up average hourly earnings growth since start of recession distorted by sharp decline and partial recovery in number of low wage jobs average hourly earnings of employees on private payrolls grew modestly through much of the recovery from the 2007 09 recession and through february 2020 wage growth averaged 2 4 percent annually inflation was modest as well but over much of the expansion real inflation adjusted wages failed to keep up with increases in workers productivity as we discuss below in part iii the pace of wage growth before adjusting for inflation quickened in 2015 and into 2016 but subsequently stalled below 3 percent until 2018 when it began edging up again the upward trend in earnings growth for all employees stalled in 2019 however despite very low unemployment low inflation led to solid real wage gains in 2015 and 2016 and to a lesser degree in 2019 average wage growth increased sharply after february 2020 but not because of widespread wage gains rather large numbers of lower wage workers bore the brunt of the job losses in the recession and the shift in the composition of total payroll employment toward higher paid jobs was large enough to temporarily raise the average wage substantially the partial recovery in low wage jobs had the opposite effect extraordinary circumstances in the pandemic recession have continued to distort recent 12 month changes but wages do seem to be on the rise the monthly average annual earnings data will be a poor guide to trends in worker pay however as long as the composition of the labor force is changing as the recovery in low wage job continues in april 2022 average hourly earnings of all employees on private payrolls were 5 5 percent higher than a year earlier earnings of non management employees were up 6 4 percent part ii federal reserve policy high employment and inflation as the 2009 recovery act s temporary fiscal stimulus measures expired with the economy still far short of full employment the primary responsibility for nurturing the economic recovery fell to the federal reserve the fed has a dual mandate from congress to pursue stable prices and maximum employment in normal times the fed does so primarily by trying to keep interest rates at a level that balances the demand for goods and services with the economy s ability to supply them lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity and employment when the economy falls short of maximum employment and raising interest rates to restrain economic activity and avoid unwanted inflation in an overheating economy from the early 1980s until the global financial crisis and the great recession the fed has primarily used changes in its target for the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans to influence economic activity changes in the federal funds rate induce changes in mortgage interest rates other consumer interest rates and the cost of business investment that influence households and businesses spending by the end of 2008 however the fed had cut the federal funds rate essentially to zero and turned to unconventional tools as described below to continue to provide the stimulus to spending needed to achieve its maximum employment mandate normally continuing to provide substantial monetary stimulus would be expected to push up inflation as the labor market became tighter but inflation fell short of the fed s target through much of the expansion even as standard indicators such as the unemployment rate and the share of the population with a job reached levels that historically indicated a tightening labor market in january 2012 the fed formally adopted a 2 percent inflation target as its goal for achieving low and stable prices using the 12 month change in the personal consumption expenditures pce price index as its preferred measure the fed subsequently made explicit that this was a symmetric target not a ceiling meaning that temporary deviations either below or above 2 percent would not necessarily elicit an immediate policy response in practice inflation was below the fed s target for most of the 2009 20 expansion leading many analysts to believe the fed was implicitly treating its inflation target as a ceiling in august 2020 however after a year long review of its operating procedures the fed issued a new statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy stating that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time the fed does not have a specific target for maximum employment while it takes into consideration a variety of labor market indicators besides the unemployment rate it periodically publishes projections by members of its monetary policymaking committee of what they expect the unemployment rate to be in the longer run under their policies as actual unemployment fell below those projections while inflation remained below target the committee members revised down their long term unemployment rate projections the median projection fell from 5 0 percent in 2015 to 4 1 percent in december 2019 and then to 4 0 percent in march 2021 although the actual unemployment rate at the peak of the expansion in february 2020 was 3 5 percent for most of the period from late 2008 through early 2021 inflation was lower than the fed s 2 percent target rate therefore the accommodative monetary policy for pursuing the fed s maximum employment goal using low interest rates and other measures to stimulate economic activity was also appropriate for raising inflation to the 2 percent target rate however the larger than expected burst of inflation that started in april 2021 requires the fed to address inflation without losing sight of its high employment dual mandate goal monetary policy at the zero lower bound raised employment but not inflation as the global financial crisis sent the economy plunging into a deep recession the fed cut its federal funds target from 5 25 percent in the late summer of 2007 to essentially zero by the end of 2008 where it remained until late 2015 with conventional rate cuts no longer possible at this zero lower bound but with the labor market still weak and inflation tame the fed turned to unconventional monetary policy tools to continue to provide stimulus and accommodate an economic recovery these tools included large scale purchases of longer term assets quantitative easing to put downward pressure on longer term interest rates and support the mortgage market and efforts to improve transparency in communicating with the public about the likely future course of monetary policy forward guidance the fed carried out three rounds of large scale purchases of treasury securities and other long term assets between 2008 and 2014 and then kept the stock of longer term assets large by reinvesting principal payments when these assets matured the fed maintained this reinvestment policy through september 2017 after which it began to taper the amount reinvested as the unemployment rate began to approach monetary policymakers projections of the longer run sustainable unemployment rate the fed also began to raise its target for the federal funds rate starting in december 2015 eventually raising it to between 2 25 and 2 5 percent in 2019 at the peak of the expansion in february 2020 the unemployment rate and other measures of labor market slack that is excess unemployment and underemployment were below their levels at the peak of the 2001 expansion for example the unemployment rate fell below the cbo s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment the rate expected to prevail when the economy is operating at full sustainable productive capacity yet inflation and wage growth were not signaling an overheating economy this situation gave the fed an opportunity to probe how low the unemployment rate could go without generating unacceptable inflation but such probing was thought to carry the risk that inflation might begin to rise fast enough that the fed would have to act more aggressively to cool an overheating economy nevertheless letting the economy run as hot as possible without triggering unacceptable inflation had many advantages including reducing long term unemployment drawing people who wanted to work but were no longer actively looking back into the labor force and reducing racial disparities in unemployment so long as businesses and households believed that the fed would act to rein in unacceptable inflation if it appeared the costs of prematurely cutting off possible additional employment gains deterred the fed from tightening monetary policy too aggressively that belief also gave the fed leeway to cut interest rates in 2019 when the post great recession expansion showed signs of faltering early in the covid 19 pandemic however the fed s task changed from continuing to support a high employment economy to doing all it could to limit the damage from the 2020 recession in the short term and to promote a robust recovery when economic activity began to revive in response to what it saw as evolving risks to economic activity posed by the pandemic the fed cut its target range to 1 00 to 1 25 percent on march 3 2020 and then to 0 to 0 25 percent the fed adopted additional unconventional measures on march 15 2020 in response to covid 19 s effects on economic activity and policy measures to contain the crisis the fed also launched substantial quantitative easing measures and measures to stabilize financial markets like those it used to address the 2008 financial crisis while the 12 month change in the pce price index remained below 2 percent from 2019 into early 2021 it jumped to 3 6 percent in april 2021 and was 6 3 percent in april 2022 the 12 month change in the more widely recognized cpi which tends to grow somewhat faster than the pce price index was 8 3 percent in april 2022 in september 2021 monetary policymakers decided to continue making large scale asset purchases of treasury and mortgage backed securities but they indicated that they could begin tapering these purchases soon in december fed policymakers also continued to believe that inflation while currently higher than they wanted was being driven by pandemic related factors that would gradually dissipate they also indicated that the fed was close to achieving its maximum employment goals with the unemployment rate below its longer term projections but labor force participation and the share of the population with a job still below pre recession levels the fed announced on november 3 2021 that it would begin to taper its large scale asset purchases slowing the pace of stimulus from quantitative easing in other words the total dollar amount of fed holdings would continue to grow but the rate of growth would slow the fed emphasized that it would continue to monitor economic conditions for any change in the economic outlook that would require adjustments to its monetary policy stance followed by a december announcement that it would be speeding up the pace at which it would be reducing its asset purchases then in march 2022 the fed announced that it was raising its target for the federal funds rate to a range between 0 25 and 0 50 percent in may it raised the rate again to a range between 0 75 and 1 00 percent the fed also has begun shrinking its stock of long term assets by not rolling over a portion of those assets when they mature together these rate hikes and quantitative tightening are intended to slow the growth of aggregate demand to reduce inflationary pressures broadest measure of slack employment fell below rate at start of post great recession expansion but spiked in pandemic the labor department s most comprehensive alternative unemployment rate measure which includes people classified as marginally attached to the labor force who want to work but have not looked for a job recently enough to be classified as unemployed and people working part time because they can t find full time jobs recorded its highest reading on record in november 2009 in data that go back to 1994 this measure known as u 6 fell steadily beginning in 2011 and was below 8 8 percent its rate at the start of the recession from february 2017 through february 2020 it jumped from 8 8 percent in march 2020 to 22 9 percent in april 2020 but has since fallen and was 7 0 percent in april 2022 employment gains in expansion wiped out by covid 19 the sharp rise in unemployment and discouragement over the prospects of finding a job in the great recession caused the labor force participation rate the percentage of the population either working or actively looking for work to fall sharply the combination of rising unemployment and falling labor force participation produced a historically steep decline in the percentage of the population with a job the employment to population ratio for both the prime working age population those aged 25 54 and for the entire population aged 16 and older the employment to population ratio of those aged 16 and older remained near its recession low until 2014 when it began to rise as labor force participation leveled off while unemployment continued to fall nevertheless in february 2020 it was still 2 6 percentage points below its rate at the start of the recession it fell in march and again in april to its lowest rate on record 51 3 percent a partial recovery brought it to 57 4 percent in october where it remained through december 2020 further increases in 2022 brought it to 60 0 percent in march 2022 which was still below the 61 2 percent rate at the start of the recession that population includes an increasing number of baby boomers near retirement or already retired thus some of the difference between their employment rate at the start of the recession and the rate more than a decade later reflected demographic trends rather than labor market weakness in contrast the employment to population ratio for those in their prime working years age 25 54 which fell 4 9 percentage points between the start of the recession and december 2009 recovered all of that loss and was 80 4 percent in february 2020 nevertheless it remained below the peak rates achieved in the 1990s expansion fell to a recent low of 69 6 percent in april 2020 and has subsequently risen to 79 9 percent in april 2022 the household survey used to estimate employment statistics is designed to distinguish between people who are unemployed actively looking and available for work and those who are not in the labor force not actively looking and in most cases not wanting a job marginally attached workers who are included in the u 6 measure of unemployment and underemployment are not in the labor force because even though they say they want a job they have not looked recently enough to be counted as unemployed these distinctions have become blurred in the pandemic because the number of people receiving unemployment insurance benefits which normally requires that one actively search for a job was expanded greatly under the cares act enacted in march 2020 how people answer the survey question of whether they are unemployed and looked for a job recently will determine whether they are classified as unemployed marginally attached or not in the labor force if lots of people who expect to be going back to work when it is safe and pandemic control measures are relaxed are recorded as not actively looking true unemployment could be undercounted and the rise in the unemployment rate could be muted the employment to population ratio might then more accurately reflect the extent of joblessness black unemployment rate reached historic low but is much higher than white rate black or african american unemployment is persistently higher roughly twice as high on average over time than white unemployment the difference between the two rates typically narrows when the economy is particularly strong and widens in recessions across data that go back to 1972 however black unemployment in the best of times is not much better than white unemployment in the worst of times black unemployment averaged 6 1 percent in 2019 and reached a historic low of 5 2 percent in august 2019 it jumped to 16 7 percent in april 2020 and was still a high 5 9 percent in april 2022 the white unemployment rate averaged 3 3 percent in 2019 and rose to 14 1 percent in april 2020 it was 3 2 percent in april 2022 hispanic latino unemployment rate reached historic low but remained higher than white rate historically the unemployment rate for hispanic latino workers has remained between the black and white unemployment rates in recessions and expansions but in april 2020 it rose above both it averaged 4 3 percent in 2019 reached an all time low of 3 9 percent in september 2019 in data that go back to 1973 and was 4 4 percent in february 2020 similar to the black and white unemployment rates it rose substantially in march and april 2020 reaching 18 9 percent in april it was 4 1 percent in april 2022 long term unemployment rate in pandemic below record high in last recession but share of unemployed still near record high set then long term unemployment the state of looking for work for 27 weeks or longer reached much higher levels and persisted much longer in the great recession and lingering jobs slump in the early stages of the expansion than in any previous period in data back to the late 1940s the worst previous episode was in the early 1980s when long term unemployment as a share of all unemployed workers peaked at 26 0 percent and the long term unemployment rate peaked at 2 6 percent in the earlier episode however a year after peaking at 2 6 percent the long term unemployment rate had dropped to 1 4 percent it took six years to fall back to that rate in the post great recession expansion which it did in june 2015 that rate was 0 9 percent in april 2022 as the number of newly unemployed swelled after february 2020 the share of all unemployed people who have been looking for work for 27 weeks or longer fell to 4 4 percent in april 2020 but as unemployment spells lengthened it rose and was 25 2 percent or 1 5 million people in april 2022 unemployed workers per job opening surged and voluntary quits rate plunged in covid 19 recession but have recovered since the number of people looking for work swelled in the great recession while the number of job openings shrank at the beginning of the last expansion there were nearly seven people looking for work for every job opening that ratio declined substantially over the expansion to the point where in february 2020 there were 5 7 million unemployed workers and 7 0 million job openings about 82 job seekers for every 100 job openings whether workers are happy or unhappy in their current job they are far less willing to quit to look for another one when job prospects are poor than when they are good the percentage of workers quitting their jobs fell sharply in the great recession but rose in the expansion surpassing the rate at the start of the recession it remained however below the rate at the peak of the 1990s expansion these favorable trends ended with the sharp contraction in economic activity and job openings in march and april 2020 when there were about five unemployed workers for every job opening that ratio has come down substantially since and in march 2022 there were 6 0 million unemployed workers and 11 5 million job openings in march there were 52 officially unemployed workers for every 100 job openings the share of employed workers quitting their jobs to look for another job fell sharply in the recession but has been rising since the quits rate which is an indicator of the confidence workers feel that they can quickly find a new job rose to the highest rate on record at 3 0 percent in november and december 2021 it was 3 0percent in march 2022 part iii prospects for economic growth and earnings great recession sharply reduced gdp and growth projections pandemic delivered another sharp blow for a half century prior to the great recession actual gdp which except in unusual circumstances such as the covid 19 pandemic is determined by the demand for goods and services fluctuated in a relatively narrow range around cbo s estimate of what the economy could supply on a sustainable non inflationary basis potential gdp actual gdp fell below potential in recessions and temporarily rose above it in booms the great recession created what at the time was an unusually large and long lasting gap between actual and potential gdp this output gap generated substantial excess unemployment and underemployment and underutilized productive capacity among businesses even as the economy began to recover the output gap gradually shrank however and late in the expansion actual gdp rose above potential gdp the major disruptions to normal economic activity in the pandemic produced a drop in gdp in 2020 that was much steeper than that of the great recession but quickly enacted relief and stimulus measures contributed to a strong partial recovery in the second quarter of 2020 cbo s july 2021 projections show the recovery continuing through 2021 and actual gdp rising above potential gdp from 2022 through 2026 that forecast was predicated on the effects of covid 19 related impacts diminishing much more than they did however although strong fourth quarter growth closed the output gap to just 0 5 percent of potential gdp at the end of 2021 part of the output gap closing in the expansion following the great recession reflected growth in actual gdp as the economy recovered from the recession a significant part however resulted from cbo s successive downward revisions after 2007 to its projections of potential gdp as a result cbo s estimates of both the level and growth rate of potential gdp in the post great recession expansion were much lower than projections made before the great recession the chart below is constructed so that a straight line represents a constant growth rate with a steeper slope representing a higher growth rate trump administration projections of return to 3 percent long term growth were unrealistic growth in potential gdp and hence in the limit on sustainable growth in actual gdp is determined by how fast the potential labor force and labor productivity grow the potential labor force in turn grows primarily through native population growth and immigration while labor productivity grows through business investment in physical capital machines factories offices and stores public investments in infrastructure and public and private investments in r d and other intellectual property improvements in labor quality through education and training can also boost productivity as can improvements in managerial efficiency or technology that enable businesses to produce more with the same amount of labor and capital short term changes in monetary and fiscal tax and spending policies aim to minimize bouts of excessive inflation or unemployment due to fluctuations in aggregate demand around potential gdp supply side policies such as well conceived tax regulatory and public investment measures can complement labor force growth and private investment in expanding potential gdp they can also produce public benefits that gdp does not necessarily capture such as distributional fairness and health and safety improvements poorly conceived policies however can impede growth and hurt national economic welfare the trump administration argued that its policies would return the economy to growth rates of 3 percent or more like those achieved in the second half of the last century cbo s more sober assessment at the time and its current assessment reflected the importance of demographic factors such as the retirement of the baby boom generation which without greater immigration will slow population and potential labor force growth substantially cbo also projected at the time and continues to project that potential gdp growth will be far short of the 3 1 percent average annual rate achieved over the entire period since 1950 which included 4 0 percent average annual growth in 1950 73 the path of potential gdp is highly uncertain at this point the deterioration in potential gdp growth in the great recession however is a cautionary tale about the risks to longer term growth when the economy undergoes a deep recession and slow recovery growth in purchasing power of workers wages and benefits has not kept pace with productivity growth productivity growth is the key to a rising material standard of living employers can afford to pay workers more without threatening their bottom line when their workers produce more per hour worked and when businesses can charge higher prices for the goods and services they sell workers enjoy a rising material standard of living when their earnings rise faster than the cost of the goods and services they buy from 1948 to 1973 productivity and the real inflation adjusted average hourly compensation wages and salaries plus fringe benefits of workers in the nonfarm business sector each nearly doubled irrespective of whether inflation is measured using producer prices or consumer prices from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s however productivity growth slowed at the same time compensation per hour adjusted for inflation in consumer prices grew much more slowly than productivity while compensation adjusted for inflation in producer prices grew at roughly the same rate as productivity that disparity arose because nonfarm business output includes not just consumer goods and services but also investment goods and exports and those output components prices rose more slowly than consumer prices because compensation adjusted for producer prices tracked productivity fairly closely during this period profit margins and hence the split in total income between the share going to workers and the share going to business owners and shareholders did not change much during this period but because consumer prices rose more than producer prices growth in the purchasing power of workers earnings fell short of growth in labor productivity productivity picked up considerably in the late 1990s and early 2000s but was disappointingly slow in the expansion following the great recession workers saw a brief spurt in their real compensation in the second half of the 1990s but have seen little progress since productivity has grown faster than compensation

world than they buy from us but the trade deficit in goods does not reflect the full scope of the united states balance of payments with the rest of the world and contrary to some recent rhetoric a trade deficit does not make the united states losers in international trade or justify a trade war the view of trade as a situation in which one country can only gain at the expense of other countries is at odds with the vast majority of economists broadly accepted understanding that trade makes each trading partner richer than it would be on its own trade expands the amount quality and variety of goods and services a country s residents can buy by allowing the country to expand production of goods and services for export that it can profitably trade for other goods and services that are cheaper to import than to produce domestically economists find that trade wars where countries impose tariffs or other restrictions on imports from one another and or subsidize their own exports can shrink those opportunities and make countries that engage in them worse off than they would be with more open trade while international trade can increase the overall size of the economy and provide net benefits to the country as a whole it also creates winners and losers within the country with the larger gains from trade spread broadly but thinly and the smaller losses concentrated in particular industries regions or groups of workers the united states needs better policies to cushion the blow for those most affected by economic shocks of all kinds including trade shocks and to ease the inevitable transition to new patterns of activity in a dynamic growing economy it is also important for the united states to be a party to negotiating multilateral international trade agreements that set the rules under which countries trade with one another and settle international trade disputes for the united states and its trading partners to enjoy the mutual benefits from trade while avoiding costly trade wars while trade policy can affect the composition of u s imports and exports and the trade balance with individual countries the overall size of the trade deficit is determined by a complex set of relationships among broader forces such as how fast the united states is growing relative to its trading partners households and domestic businesses saving and investment decisions multinational corporations decisions about where to invest which are influenced by tax policy and economic fundamentals and finally federal budget policy and foreign central banks and international investors willingness to hold u s debt when u s households businesses and governments collectively spend more than they produce excess spending must be met through net imports and foreigners must be willing to finance that excess spending incomes interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar adjust to bring the amount of excess spending the trade balance and foreign willingness to lend to the united states into alignment net borrowing from foreigners to finance current account deficit still well below mid 2000 s peak the united states sold 1 43 trillion worth of goods to the rest of the world in 2020 and bought 2 35 trillion worth of goods from the rest of the world resulting in a goods deficit of 922 billion equal to 4 4 percent of gdp the united states ran a surplus in services such as tourism education and financial services and received more investment income and other payments from abroad than it sent abroad as a result the current account the most comprehensive measure of trade and income flows between the united states and the rest of the world because it includes goods services and income earned in or paid to the rest of the world had a deficit of 616 billion equal to 2 9 percent of gdp in 2020 the united states balance of payments however includes not only the income flows recorded in the current account but also capital flows associated with borrowing lending and investment by the united states and its trading partners dollars flow in when the rest of the world lends to the united states by buying u s treasury securities and other u s financial assets or invests directly in the united states by acquiring establishing or expanding businesses here dollars flow out when the united states lends to the rest of the world by buying foreign financial assets or when u s companies invest abroad the united states is both the largest direct investor in other countries and the largest recipient of foreign direct investment the difference between new foreign direct investment in the united states and new u s direct investment abroad is relatively small in most years the united states is a large net borrower from the rest of the world however because sales of u s treasury debt and other financial assets to the rest of the world far exceed u s purchases of foreign financial assets the dollars that flow out to purchase imports must ultimately flow back in as export sales or as an increase in foreign holdings of u s assets net of u s holdings of foreign assets in other words net national borrowing is the mirror image of the current account deficit in the year those capital flows occur subsequently the interest and profits that foreigners receive by lending to or investing in the united states will be income payments to the rest of the world in future current accounts and the income the united states receives from foreign direct investment or purchases of foreign financial assets will be income payments from the rest of the world the united states has been a net borrower for much of the last four decades with borrowing peaking at 6 0 percent of gdp in 2006 u s net borrowing and its complement the current account deficit then shrank with the collapse of trade and capital flows worldwide in the financial crisis and great recession after hovering around 2 percent of gdp since 2013 net borrowing from abroad rose to 3 percent of gdp in 2020 as the deficit in the balance on goods edged up and the surplus in the balance of services and current income flows edged down data for the first half of 2021 indicate a further increase in net borrowing from abroad as a share of gdp but to a level still below the 2006 peak as a result of decades of net borrowing the difference between total u s assets held abroad and total foreign assets held in the united states known as its net international investment position was negative 14 trillion at the end of 2020 compared with negative 11 2 trillion at the end of 2019 nevertheless the rest of the world so far has been a willing lender to the united states moreover despite this large net debt the income the united states receives from its holdings of foreign assets has exceeded the income it pays to foreign holders of u s treasury debt and other u s assets historically the united states has enjoyed relatively low borrowing costs due in part to the dollar s role as a reserve currency that is in demand worldwide to facilitate international trade and settle international financial obligations whether or not they involve the united states since the 2008 09 global financial crisis worldwide demand for safe financial assets especially u s treasury securities has kept u s international borrowing costs particularly low relative to the income the united states earns on its investment abroad federal budget deficits are often but not always the major source of net national borrowing the united states has been a net international borrower every year but one since 1982 that s because in most of those years federal budget deficits were larger than net lending in the rest of the economy net lending or borrowing in a particular sector of the economy is the difference between that sector s aggregate saving and its aggregate investment in productive capital any surplus of saving over investment is available for lending any shortfall of saving relative to investment requires borrowing an economy wide surplus of saving over investment must be lent or invested abroad a shortfall must be offset by borrowing or attracting investment from the rest of the world in the early to mid 1980s a steep recession and policymakers decisions to lower tax rates and increase defense spending produced large federal budget deficits non federal saving consistently exceeded non federal investment but by less than federal borrowing hence the country was a net borrower in the international economy non federal lending or saving is the sum of such activity by households domestic businesses and state and local governments in the 1990s expansion by contrast a strong economy together with effective deficit reduction and budget enforcement policies produced declining budget deficits and eventually surpluses in 1998 2001 meanwhile foreign funding attracted by the strong economy and booming stock market flowed in to help fuel a surge in domestic investment that outstripped domestic saving these foreign capital inflows turned the non federal sector into a large enough net borrower to keep the country a net borrower despite the falling federal budget deficits and eventual surpluses the 2001 recession and deficit producing tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 ended the brief era of federal budget surpluses the federal government became a major borrower again but businesses and households also went on a borrowing binge in the housing boom preceding the great recession that combination led to record net national borrowing that reached 6 0percent of gdp in 2006 the great recession and policymakers enactment of temporary fiscal stimulus measures created large budget deficits in 2009 12 however the substantial rise in federal borrowing to fund these deficits was partly offset by a collapse in investment and sharp reduction in borrowing in the non federal sector as a result net national borrowing while still substantial actually was lower as a share of gdp over this period than it had been immediately prior to the recession tax cuts and spending increases in late 2017 and early 2018 led to increased federal borrowing in 2018 and 2019 that was partly offset by greater net lending the sharp fall in economic activity in early 2020 lowered government revenues while spending on relief and recovery measures increased sharply federal borrowing rose sharply but private saving increased sharply as well and u s net borrowing rose only to about 3 percent of gdp in 2020 methodological differences produce slightly different net borrowing in the balance of payments statistics described above from those in the national income accounts data for the first half of 2021 show an increase in federal borrowing and non federal lending resulting in a modest increase in net borrowing part v conclusion the economy was on solid footing in february 2020 it had been growing since mid 2009 and the huge job losses from the 2007 2009 great recession had been erased by 2014 the economic expansion continued into 2020 becoming the longest expansion on record before ending abruptly in the covid 19 pandemic growth in the long expansion averaged 2 3 percent per year below the rate the congressional budget office was projecting just prior to the great recession president trump made bold claims for how his policies would raise the economy s sustainable growth rate significantly above the 2 2 percent growth rate it had achieved prior to his inauguration and produce a significant increase in the typical worker s earnings those claims were much more optimistic than what the congressional budget office and most other outside analysts expected and were not borne out while the recovery from the great recession appeared to be faltering in 2015 it regained momentum in the second half of 2016 and economic growth trended upward with gdp 3 2 percent higher in the second quarter of 2018 than in the same quarter a year earlier the growth rate trended down thereafter however and gdp grew just 2 3 percent between the fourth quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2019 which turned out to be the peak of the longest expansion in u s history the 2020 recession turned out to be the deepest but shortest of all recessions in the post world war ii years substantial fiscal relief and recovery legislation together with a highly accommodative monetary policy allowed the economy to recover about half of the losses incurred in the recession relatively quickly but subsequent waves of the virus have contributed to an uneven pattern of gdp and employment growth in the post 2020 recession recovery and expansion

general of the china overseas development association coda he zhenwei who talked to ria novosti ahead of the st petersburg international economic forum spief trade between china and the us mainly relies on small and medium sized enterprises while china s bilateral trade with russia accounts for large state owned enterprises he said however many chinese export oriented small and medium sized enterprises are now facing difficulties the us has already raised its duties on chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent which is tantamount to closing its doors in case american consumers agree to pay more out of their pockets these companies will be able to raise prices on products by 25 percent which is hardly probable he said in such harsh conditions chinese companies are now struggling to maintain their existence they should think about moving production to russia he said he added chinese goods produced in russia could be further sold in the united states and even in europe trade

large portion of its u s treasury holdings last year and officials in europe put forward proposals to increase the use of the euro in regional transactions we aren t ditching the dollar the dollar is

overview the implications of president trump s assessment that there has not been nearly enough progress in negotiations with mexico that would avert the tariff on june 10 competing for investors attention which had been squarely today s ecb meeting minutes before trump spoke fitch cut its sovereign rating for mexico to bbb from bbb while moody s cut its outlook to negative from stable the risk off mood was seen in asia where most equity markets fell though hong kong korean and australian equities advanced indian stocks fell over 1 despite the central bank cutting the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 bp to 5 75 and 5 50 respectively the shanghai composite also fell by more than 1 it was the sixth consecutive decline european markets are faring better and the dow jones stoxx 600 is extending its advance into a fourth session benchmark 10 year yields are mostly lower italy is underperforming following the eu s warning on the country s debt the us 10 year yield is off around three basis points to 2 10 the dollar is softer against all of the major currencies but sterling central and eastern european currencies are firmer while the turkish lira south african rand and chinese yuan are lower the mexican peso is stabilizing at lower levels oil prices are stabilizing after yesterday s slide that was spurred by a surge in us inventories 22 mln barrels of crude and fuel gold is higher for the sixth consecutive session and it has risen for 10 of the past 11 sessions it approached 1345 yesterday just shy of the year s high seen in february asia pacific the trade tension with china is not deterring the us from pursuing policies that will antagonize china further reports suggest the us is close to striking a 2 bln arms deals with taiwan that include state of the art tanks anti aircraft and anti armor weapons it is not clear whether the f 16 fighter jets will be included in this or a subsequent deal china will protest this but there is little it can do even though the us recognizes that taiwan is a province of the prc aid to venezuela might be part of china s counter but the deteriorating economic prospects have led russia to scale back its military presence as the maduro government cannot afford to pay as much for protection the dollar is trading within yesterday s range against the yen jpy107 80 jpy 108 50 it is the first session this week that the greenback has not yet been below jpy108 00 where a 2 8 bln expiring option is struck there are 2 4 bln in options struck at jpy108 25 that also will be cut and 2 1 bln at jpy108 50 the dollar has fallen against the yen for six of the past seven weeks it closed last week near jpy108 30 the australian dollar reversed lower yesterday failing to establish a foothold above 0 7000 however buyers reemerged near 0 6965 but another run at 0 7000 may be difficult ahead of the us jobs report tomorrow europe the ecb cannot be happy external risks have not diminished indeed since it met last the risks of a no deal brexit and escalation in trade tensions have increased on top of this price pressures have eased and at 1 2 in may was the lowest in a year about a third of this increase is due to food and energy prices putting the core at 0 8 for all the effort the core rate bottomed at 0 6 in january 2015 the risks are to the downside and the staff forecasts may be tweaked lower the ecb is expected to provide more details about the new loan facility a negative rate associated with the targeted lending would be most beneficial to those banks who have used this facility the most in the past and that is understood to be in the south the market appears to be discounting the chances of a 10 bp rate cut in about a year s time and at least one european bank predicted a resumption of asset purchases next year under a new ecb president germany appears to be gradually improving yesterday the may composite pmi was confirmed at a three month high which was a bit better than the flash estimate today it reported an unexpected increase in april factory orders they were expected to be flat after a 0 6 increase in march instead they rose 0 3 and the march series was revised to show a 0 8 increase that said domestic orders actually fell 0 8 while foreign orders rose 1 1 the euro posted a key reversal yesterday after making new highs for the move trading above 1 13 briefly for the first time since mid april it reversed course and closed below the previous day s low a little below 1 1230 note that the 1 1210 area corresponds to a 50 retracement of the euro s bounce that began in the second half of last week the next retracement 61 8 is found near 1 1190 it languishes in yesterday s trough and has not been above 1 1250 ahead of the ecb meeting there is a roughly 950 mln option struck at 1 1200 that will be cut today and another 1 2 bln euros at 1 1220 the euro has typically fallen on days that the ecb has met since the beginning of last year last september and this past april have been exceptions to the rule sterling reversed lower after testing the 20 day moving average 1 2750 yesterday for the first time in since may 13 it slipped further today but found some bids by 1 2670 the broad dollar direction seems to be the most important consideration now america fitch seemed more concerned about the slowing of the mexican economy and pemex s debt than the us threat to levy escalating tariff on all imports from mexico fitch s move is important because it is to bring it to bbb moody s which cut its outlook to negative is at a3 a is at the high with s p in the middle at bbb negative outlook the peso which had stabilized in recent days was hit with this one two punch the dollar quickly jumped from around mxn19 58 to around mxn19 84 it is trading near mxn19 70 ahead of the open of the local markets recall the high set earlier this week was almost mxn19 61 it is almost as if trump is juggling the continental issues and china his tougher stand against mexico comes as one can expect niceties from mnuchin and the pboc governor who will meet at the g20 finance ministers meeting in japan over the weekend trump seemed more relaxed in the uk about huawei and seemed to offer reassurances that the intelligence relationship would continue the us position shares with its trade stance a desire to limit quantities the fact that mexico is apprehended nearly double the number of undocumented migrants last month from a year ago is not sufficient if the number of undocumented migrants trying to come into the us also rise a tariff on mexico hurts trump in three ways first like all tariffs is a tax that the buyer pays movement of goods within us companies whose operations are on both sides of the border account for as much as 60 of trade it would undermine support from part of his base second such a tariff on mexico would kill the usmca the threat alone is potent third it could lead to congress overruling the president on his use of emergency power and taking back some trade authority this would be the moral equivalent of a censure the us reports the april trade balance q1 productivity and unit labor costs figures and weekly jobless claims but the focus today is elsewhere ecb and tomorrow s employment report and mexico yesterday s news was mixed the adp disappointed with a lowly 27k increase in private sector jobs but it was offset by the unexpected strength of the non manufacturing ism which included a big rise in employment 58 1 from 53 7 and new orders 58 6 from 58 1 the beige book was also mostly upbeat with business outlook solidly positive on the other hand the distress of farmers has increased amid poor weather and lower prices for crops canada also reports april trade figures and non oil exports may be the key to the market s reaction after approaching last month s low cad1 3360 the us dollar popped back above cad1 34 yesterday it reached cad1 3430 earlier today but is coming off in line with the softer tone against the other majors it is difficult for short term participants to have much conviction the us dollar began the week north of cad1 35 the upper end of its recent range has frayed the lower end of the range the dollar index recovered yesterday after reaching its lowest level since april 12 95 75 however there has been no follow through buying today it is in a 15 tick range through the european morning as the market awaits the ecb meeting and press conference disclaimer
harish puppala rakesh sharma there was more than a bit of noise since the start of 2019 that macroeconomic indicators er indicated india s economy was slowing down not quite a doomsday scenario but a serious cause for concern nonetheless we were told even ex rbi governor raghuram rajan strode across the election landscape in about april and may to talk about the unhealthy state of affairs business news lamented what they called a missed opportunity in 2014 for serious changes that would have helped economic growth story continues below advertisement remove ad in fact mint reported that gdp numbers last october showed the indian economy growing at 8 2 percent in the april june quarter one year ago the fastest quarterly growth in over two years however that did not shield the government from criticism over its handling of the economy the falling rupee worsening current account deficit and stress in the banking sector raised questions over the sustainability of the recent economic recovery as it turned out none of that deterred voters from installing narendra modi in the prime minister s office once again so what were the wise men talking about or is it that common people on the street simply didn t care in this podcast we re looking at what macroeconomic indicator means and what such parameters looked like before modi resigned only to have a bigger swearing in ceremony of course what are macroeconomic indicators let s get the definitions right first macroeconomics according to trusty ol investopedia is a branch of economics that studies the way the aggregate economy behaves economy wide phenomena are examined such as inflation price levels rate of economic growth national income gross domestic product or gdp and changes in unemployment that s right the rudimentaries that constitute an economy to break that down into even simpler terms macroeconomics looks at the overall big picture scenario of the economy and then analyzes how different sectors of the economy relate to one another to understand how the economy functions this includes looking at variables like unemployment gdp and inflation macroeconomic models and the forecasts they produce are used by many organizations by government entities to aid in the construction and evaluation of economic policy by businesses to set strategy in domestic and global markets and by investors to predict and plan for movements in various asset markets microeconomics on the other hand looks at the behavior of individual actors in an economy like people households industries etc story continues below advertisement remove ad story continues below advertisement remove ad these macroindicators can be anything the investor chooses but specific pieces of data released by governments and non profit organizations have become widely followed the most up to date regularly published report covers the latest statistics on gdp inflation agricultural production employment savings investments core industries growth export import government securities yield monetary indicators etc applicable to the economy of these four important indicators are gdp interest rate consumer price index and industrial production gdp let s examine gdp for a minute in india gdp is one of the most recognized economic indicators used by financial advisors economists research analysts investors traders etc to trace recent economic developments gdp or gross domestic product is one of the most important economic indicators to measure a country s economic health it is the total economic production of the country the face of the economy as it were when gdp value increases it signals a strong or strengthening economy however it is one of the lagging indicators meaning it tells us what has already happened not what is going to happen many businesses adjust their payroll expenditures and inventory based on quarterly or annual gdp results india s economy grew at 6 6 percent in 2017 18 and according to the world bank at 7 3 percent in fy19 some remarkable improvement was seen in the april july quarter of 2018 19 in gdp when it grew by an impressive 8 2 percent interest rate then there is the interest rate decisions regarding interest rate and monetary policies are handled by the reserve bank of india in case you ve never followed financial news in india you should know that it is considered a major economic event in india when the rbi decides interest rates for businesses consumers investors and indeed india s economy it is again one of the lagging indicators that represents the money lent between banks in india monetary policies are determined by the monetary policy committee yes they re creative when it comes to naming committees here s how they work consider this instance when the monetary policy committee increases interest rates commercial banks or other lenders have to pay more interest to obtain money from the central bank which they make up for by lending money to borrowers at higher rates that make it difficult for borrowers to take out loans as a result borrowers or consumers are less enthused about taking loans and businesses are discouraged from expanding their operations as a result gdp growth is affected conversely if the interest rates are too low not too surprisingly it results in increased demand for money a rise in prices and eventually inflation therefore interest rates are crucial economic indicators that let us know if the economy is heating up cpi which brings us to the all important cpi we ll slide right by all the low hanging communist jokes and get to the point cpi is consumer price index or what we know as inflation before cpi wpi or wholesale price index was one of the prime economic indicators used to measure inflation india used this indicator for a fairly very long time before adopting the consumer price index to measure the rate of inflation why is cpi better it calculates inflation from the consumer s end includes services which account for nearly 60 percent of gdp and accounts for rural as well as urban regions it measures the change in prices of the total basket of goods and services like transportation medical care and food over a period of time that is why it is also known as the cost of living index we already know the deal with inflation increasing inflation usually indicates a decrease in purchasing power for people then it has been observed repeatedly that the average standard of living declines with a rise in inflation inflation also influences job growth gdp and employment rates on the other hand high inflation results in high interest rates which in turn encourages people to invest more and encourages financial institutions to provide loans to small firms and entrepreneurs another parameter that is scrutinized is industrial production investors who have put their money in manufacturing mining gas and utility sectors use the economic calendar for collecting reports on industrial production in india data on industrial production is put out every month this data includes figures based on the raw volume of goods produced by factories electric utilities mines etc industrial production is a key economic indicator that measures future inflation at the industrial level government authorities too keep an eye out for this data because it can indicate trends the drawback it only measures data for actual goods producing industries and firms what s happening in india india s fourth quarter gdp data was released on 31 may and showed the economy growing at 5 8 percent in the january march period the slowest pace in 17 quarters another set of government data showed that india s infrastructure output grew 2 6 percent in april compared to last year the government meanwhile has met the fiscal deficit target 3 4 percent of gdp for fy19 after sharply cutting spending towards the end of the financial year as revenue fell short of estimates a couple of weeks ago mint reported that after showing some signs of improvement in march their macro tracker indicated a deterioration in india s macroeconomy in april thanks to a sharp slowdown in the consumer economy and a widening of the trade deficit slowing vehicle sales and weak air traffic growth suggest demand in the economy continues to be weak price signals reinforce this picture it claimed the slowing down of inflation is a bright spot in an otherwise negative scenario but it also signals weak purchasing power among the masses even as retail inflation remains benign the underlying core inflation excluding volatile items such as food and fuel which was trending above average till february also eased in march and april mint claims low rural wage growth also points to weak demand conditions in rural india that weak consumer sentiment seems to be crimping demand in the industrial sector rail freight traffic growth and core sector growth which reflect growth in india s eight key infrastructure industries such as power coal etc are close to the red zone and currently flashing amber while the purchasing managers index or pmi for manufacturing still signals an expansion the momentum is slowing down as the reading declined for three consecutive months to 51 8 in april from 54 3 in february media reports indicated that fiscal deficit targets will be revised upwards and the union government may lean more on stimulating the economy and less on consolidating its finances while this could boost consumption demand and have ripple effects on industrial demand such a choice is fraught with risks and could also undo hard won gains in the fight against inflation and burgeoning public debt it could also make india more vulnerable to external shocks that s the state of affairs in may and june 2019 let s also take a quick look at the data for the last five years the narendra modi era business journalist vivek kaul wrote that the quality of india s economic data in general and gdp data in particular has come in for questioning in recent months those questions acquired more urgency in january when the gdp growth in 2016 17 was revised to 8 2 percent the highest in any year between 2011 12 and 2018 19 he claimed that in fy17 a large section of the informal economy which forms a significant portion of india s economy was severely hit by demonetisation so he asks how did the economy grow at 8 2 percent you probably recall the ruckus from january 2015 when the government recalibrated its gdp growth series data based on this the ministry of statistics and programme implementation revised past gdp numbers the data revealed that growth during the upa years term averaged 8 1 percent higher than the 7 3 percent in the first four years of the nda government that sparked moire than one political debate and the ministry later added a caveat saying the data wasn t final then in november the government think tank niti aayog and cso india s central statistics office downgraded growth during the upa years the first four years of modi showed higher average growth of 7 4 percent than during the upa s 6 7 percent the modi government disregarded the august numbers as experimental sparking opposition fury that questioned the sanctity of the numbers numbers that have been questioned ever since in any case indications are that lower consumer spending sluggish investments and slower growth in agriculture and manufacturing are adversely affecting growth sure there were blips it had to give its initial fiscal deficit target of 3 3 percent for the last financial year a miss in the interim budget presented earlier this year that number was revised to 3 4 percent however economists are not very sure even this target will be met and some have voiced concerns it may stay put at the current 3 5 percent levels the government achieved the current fiscal deficit thanks to the rs 28 000 crore that the rbi transferred as interim dividend for fy19 that move wasn t received happily by all economists opposition parties accused the government of accounting jugglery to meet disinvestment targets and keep fiscal deficit under check one an economist with a rating agency told quartz there have been farm loan waivers populist measures in the budget and a shortfall in revenue and still fiscal deficit is under check this is a wonder and just forces one to think how is the government actually managing to do it that said one wonders if that isn t true of most governments in india s history what about the much touted investments a report in quartz claimed that an important reason for faltering gdp growth is the sombre investment environment according to the centre for monitoring indian economy cmie a think tank that tracks economic data investments into new projects in the quarter ended dec 31 2018 stood at their lowest level since modi took charge that is a far cry from the bjp s promise of bringing in fresh investment and kick starting stalled projects to spur growth between october and december 2018 the value of stalled projects shot up to rs3 18 lakh crore the second highest in the modi government s tenure which brings us to a flagship programme of the modi government make in india while it made for a nice slogan it had a decidedly underwhelming outcome or first four years frankly speaking it showcases the failure of the government to implement its make in india programme which aimed to make the country a manufacturing hub and spur investments abheek barua chief economist of hdfc bank said it started off with a lot of fanfare but has not managed to take things off the ground we don t seem to have a comprehensible plan for local production of goods or services moving on in the list of economic indicators we come to one that s close to our hearts and wallets inflation as mentioned earlier slowing rural growth softening international commodity prices and erratic monsoons have taken a toll on indian farmers in certain regions some media reports claims farm income has slumped to a 14 year low and that non farm wage growth has slowed down painting an even bleaker picture of the state of the rural economy the opposition attempted to make farm distress an election issue but failed to communicate their point of view cogently that s probably because the modi government managed to keep inflation in check devendra kumar pant chief economist at india ratings said it is an achievement of the current government as prices of essential items have not shot through the roof and finally employment one side claims an unemployment crisis has exploded across india the other side says what crisis glancing back at modi s campaign in 2013 14 one of his main promises was adding 10 million new jobs if voted to office five years later it s safe to say that s not quite what transpired according to a government survey cited by business standard a few months ago unemployment had risen to a 45 year high of 6 1 percent in 2017 18 that s a serious concern for a country expected to add over 280 million people to the job market by 2050 a world bank report pointed out that india needs to create over 8 million jobs per year to maintain its current employment rate however it s not all doom and gloom for the india story while serious concerns have been expressed and are expected to be addressed it is also true that major financial institutions and trade organizations have expressed confidence in india s growth trajectory in march moody s announced that the indian economy is expected to grow at 7 3 percent in calendar year 2019 and 2020 the american rating agency said india is less exposed to a slowdown in global manufacturing trade growth compared to other major asian economies and emerging markets and is poised to grow at a relatively stable pace in the two years it also added government spending announced ahead of elections this year will support near term growth david m solomon ceo of goldman sachs said a few days ago if the reform programme accelerates there can be considerable upside in the gdp growth on a forward basis our growth will closely match that of the growth of the indian economy our base case on gdp growth is 7 5 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development more commonly known as oecd said in its economic outlook in may gdp growth in india is projected to strengthen to close to 7 25 percent in fy19 and close to 7 5 percent in fy20 the economic times reported that oecd highlighted india as the fastest growing economy among the g20 with export growth holding up well investment growth will accelerate as capacity utilisation rises interest rates decline and geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty are assumed to wane

excluding food and fuel down to 4 5 percent in april from 5 1 percent in march and a revision by the rbi on the gdp for fy20 from 7 2 percent to 7 percent indicates just that this is positive for the

anagha deodhar economist icici securities on rbi monetary policy the 25bps rate cut is in line with our expectation although inflation has started inching up it is still closer to the lower end of mpc s target range of 2 6 percent core inflation has also come down significantly indicating soft underlying inflation hence purely from inflation targeting perspective the mpc has enough room to cut rates moreover the recently released gdp numbers show that growth is faltering given the challenging domestic and global environment growth is likely to remain weak in h2fy20 although supporting growth is not the mpc s primary mandate in the current environment it has assumed greater significance given the lower growth and inflation expectations it was apt to change the stance to accommodative it indicates that more rate cuts are on the table possibly in the next policy itself suvodeep rakshit sr economist kotak institutional equities rbi reduced repo rate by 25 bps as expected the change in stance to accommodative was a bit of a surprise debt markets will take this as a significant positive move though most of the rate cut cycle is probably over the tone of the rbi policy was dovish and highlights the concerns on growth we maintain our call for another 25 bps rate cut in august factoring in the benign inflation trajectory and the growing concerns on growth however transmission of the rate cuts will be key and the rbi should aim to maintain the liquidity at least at neutral over the next few months garima kapoor economist elara capital drawing comfort from consistent softness in inflation trajectory mpc cut policy repo rate for the third time this year to support benign growth conditions a shift in the stance to accommodative is welcome as it will

illustration by melinda beck a version of this article appeared in the autumn 2019 issue of strategy business for the last 70 years the world has done remarkably well according to the world bank the number of people living in extreme poverty today is less than it was in 1820 even though the world population is seven times as large this is a truly remarkable achievement and it goes hand in hand with equally remarkable overall advances in wealth scientific progress human longevity and quality of life but the organizations that created these triumphs the most prominent businesses governments and multilateral institutions of the post world war ii era have failed to keep their implicit promises as a result today s leading organizations face a global crisis of legitimacy for the first time in decades their influence and even their right to exist are being questioned businesses are also being held accountable in new ways for the welfare prosperity and health of the communities around them and of the general public pwc s own global network of firms is among these businesses the accusations facing any individual enterprise may or may not be justified but the broader attitudes underlying them must be taken seriously the causes of this crisis of legitimacy have to do with five basic challenges affecting every part of the world asymmetry wealth disparity and the erosion of the middle class wealth disparity and the erosion of the middle class disruption abrupt technological changes and their destructive effects abrupt technological changes and their destructive effects age demographic pressures as the average life span of human beings increases and the birth rate falls demographic pressures as the average life span of human beings increases and the birth rate falls populism growing populism and rejection of the status quo with associated nationalism and global fracturing growing populism and rejection of the status quo with associated nationalism and global fracturing trust declining confidence in the prevailing institutions that make our systems work we use the acronym adapt to list these challenges because it evokes the inherent change in our time and the need for institutions to respond with new attitudes and behaviors a few other challenges such as climate change and human rights issues may occur to you as equally important they are not included in this list because they are not at the forefront of this particular crisis of legitimacy in the same way but they are affected by it if leading businesses and global institutions lose their perceived value it will be harder to address every other issue affecting the world today ignoring the crisis of legitimacy is not an option not even for business leaders who feel their primary responsibility is to their shareholders if we postpone solutions too long we could go past the point of no return the cost of solving these problems will be too high brexit could be a test case the costs and difficulties of withdrawal could be echoed in other political breakdowns around the world and if you don t believe that widespread economic and political disruption is possible right now then consider the other revolutions and abrupt dramatic changes in sovereignty that have occurred in the last 250 years often with technological shifts and widespread dissatisfaction as key factors what then would it take to rebuild the credibility of the important businesses of the world and other critical multilateral institutions so that they retain enough legitimacy to not just survive but participate as leaders in solving the world s urgent problems as business leaders we must accept our responsibility for helping to solve these problems we must recognize that the solutions are neither easy nor obvious and that they will require a fundamental shift in thinking we need to recognize the factors that generated the problems how they emerged as the unintended consequences of successful business and political practices why they have been ignored for so long and how to come to terms with addressing them asymmetry prosperity derailed the city of hamilton ontario gained its prosperity from steel mills opened in the early 1900s they were a constant source of good wages for industrial workers who could afford small houses nearby and who expected their children to attend college and live better lives than they had hamilton s two global steelmaking companies stelco and dofasco supported a vibrant community with a major university mcmaster and a renowned medical school if you don t believe that widespread economic and political disruption is possible right now then consider the revolutions that have occurred in the last 250 years but after the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 canada s steel industry collapsed mill workers had trouble finding new jobs and the work they found was often lower paid their neighborhoods have since become less desirable their children s prospects bleaker however today entrepreneurs in higher tech industries in hamilton are doing better than ever and the area s wine region is thriving hamilton is a microcosm of the economic challenges facing us not just in industrialized countries such as canada but everywhere wealth disparity is increasing the world s assets are now concentrated in the hands of a small number of people as the gap widens the average wealth and purchasing power of the middle class erodes this may be more obvious in the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development countries where the size of middle income groups those with a household net income that is between 0 75 and two times the median has consistently decreased since 1988 but it is also true of major emerging economies such as china and india where the urban middle class has not kept pace with those at the top of the pyramid and is even at risk of slipping back according to the crowdsourced cost of living database numbeo a number of cities in emerging economies have extremely high ratios of average housing price to average annual income these include algiers beijing caracas guangzhou kathmandu mumbai phnom penh shanghai shenzhen and tehran in the world as a whole less than 1 percent of the adults hold more than 45 percent of the wealth between 2008 and 2018 the number of billionaires more than doubled from 1 125 to 2 754 two main factors have driven economic asymmetry the shift of work from high wage to lower wage countries due to globalization and automation and the growing amount of wealth including that generated by productivity gains captured by shareholders instead of employees both factors have had a host of secondary effects often showing up as disparities between capital holders and wage earners analysis by the international labour organization pdf has found that in 52 high income countries average labor productivity and thus typically profits grew nearly 17 percent from 1999 to 2015 while real wages grew only about 13 percent over time wealthy investors have used their leverage to widen the gap still further for instance they have moved away from the public capital markets to private equity hedge funds and syndicates these vehicles tend to give better returns but are open only to accredited investors meanwhile the prevailing shift in pension funds from defined benefit schemes which feature a monthly payment to defined contribution systems in which employees accrue a lump sum to live on after retirement has left many middle class people dependent on the stock market for their old age which is less advantaged and thus less capable of supporting them other effects of asymmetry reinforce the trend exacerbating the damage it does for example rising house prices will prevent many middle class people currently under the age of 40 from buying homes in their lifetime they will thus lose one of the main middle class means of accumulating wealth in australia according to theconversation com a site that reports on academic research homeownership by 25 to 34 year olds fell from 61 percent to 44 percent between 1981 and 2016 wealth disparity also challenges the ability of many governments to collect tax revenues and provide services the three most widely used forms of individual taxation are disproportionately low for those with extreme wealth they receive less of their wealth in salaries income tax consume relatively little in proportion to their wealth consumption tax and often live in residences owned by corporations real estate tax in addition in recent years technological advances have made it easier for high net worth individuals to move their money to low tax regimes thus as wealth disparity grows the availability of tax revenue shrinks just when more is needed finally economic asymmetry makes the middle class more vulnerable to other threats if automation takes middle class workers jobs away they have less of a cushion to fall back on while looking for work or developing new skills if storms and other extreme weather events related to climate change threaten their homes and livelihoods they are less likely to have insurance and more likely to lose any savings they have people also become more vulnerable to emotional problems when quality of life for the middle class declines in a seemingly never ending cycle people respond by losing hope in the rural u s in the last few years for example rates of excessive drinking drug overdoses and suicide have increased enough to shorten average life expectancy in the united states although much has been written about the effects of asymmetry it does not receive the attention it deserves among global business leaders that s in part because of the way economic success is most often measured through shareholder value for organizations and gdp for countries reliance on these two metrics has distorted our understanding of economic value they provide high level views of average prosperity gains that mask the disparities beneath disruption technology unbound a few years ago one of the remarkable success stories of china was the midsized city of kunshan just outside shanghai as recently as the late 1970s many of its people had lived in huts subsisting on the land or lakes then it became a manufacturing center known as little taiwan its factories attracted many workers from central and western china typically women chosen for their skill at small parts assembly they lived in large communal housing and sent much of their salary home kunshan ultimately developed one of the world s great universities and is launching many technology based startups it is now a thriving modern city with many cultural activities high quality infrastructure trees and flowers everywhere and a reputation as a foodie town but it is no longer a magnet for factory employees its plants are converting to robots this leaves many of kunshan s migrant employees with few options beyond returning home to an existence similar to the one they left behind the impact of technological disruption is just now becoming apparent to be sure it does have an extremely positive side advances in medicine materials science energy production and information technology have improved life in ways that might have been unimaginable in the early 1900s entrepreneurs have abandoned old business models to create powerful startups that generate great wealth and prosperity and improve the quality of life but disruption is also having severe effects on workers who face potential job losses from automation on governments which have to manage many new stresses and especially on existing businesses according to credit suisse the average life span of a standard poor s company has decreased since the 1950s from more than 60 years then to less than 20 years today is nothing new noted the bank s 2018 report on this theme what s new is the speed complexity and global nature of it most industries are adapting business leaders know they have to embrace new forms of digital technology and new platforms are emerging to help them do this solutions are being found for the challenges of artificial intelligence ai automation cyber attack intellectual property theft and the misuse of consumer data nonetheless these problems are so pervasive and daunting that many mainstream institutions still find them hard to manage which has exacerbated the loss of their credibility the worst effects are felt by established institutions whose reputations depend to some degree on public trust banks and financial services firms the media regulators schools the legal system and the police these institutions have generally been in existence for a long time and they were designed to change slowly to be solid reliable entities that could provide a sustained service to society professional journalists long supported by stable media funded through advertising and subscriptions are replaced by clickbait vendors on social media platforms who attract attention by telling people what they want to hear education must keep up with the demands for new skills and major changes in the way people receive information police are grappling with the task of preventing new forms of crime while also having their own actions captured on video and distributed digitally regulators and tax authorities are trying to catch up with radical new businesses that operate across a broad range of countries and industries to address the impact of technological disruption we will need to invest far more money time attention and knowledge in building the skills of the global workforce this will involve identifying the capabilities that companies and governments need and creating a culture of lifelong learning including for people who have not been used to it in many cases this challenge will bring together government industry and academic groups that have not worked together before the challenge of re skilling the planet is immense but the stakes could not be higher without the right talent the world s institutions will simply not be able to fulfill their purpose age demographics unresolved at japan s ministry of education senior officials tell a tale of woe shrinking enrollment competition for revenues from a declining tax base and a lack of jobs for teachers and university professors the average age in japan will be 53 in 2050 a function of declining fertility rates and increasing average life expectancy unless there is a significant unforeseen change the country can look ahead to overtaxed healthcare systems inadequate pensions and retirement savings and a relatively small workforce supporting a huge base of retirees get the strategy business newsletter delivered to your inbox sample email email address then there s india s ministry of education it s hard to believe it exists in the same world as japan s indian officials have proposed building 500 000 new schools over the next decade including at least 1 000 new universities to accommodate the country s burgeoning youthful population but they ll never get the approval the task would consume several times the government s entire budget instead the country will try to create between 10 million and 18 million new jobs a year at a time when many of its newly formed technology jobs such as call center staffing are being threatened by technological disruption and ai most countries today fall into one of two groups defined by their demographic problems old population societies such as japan china russia and most western european countries have too many aging people to sustain current workforce policies and pension systems their challenges are exacerbated by the medical and lifestyle related challenges of a longer life even the healthiest people over 65 require higher levels of medical expenditure and increases in chronic disease and lifelong obesity add dramatically to these costs it s not surprising that healthcare expenses per capita are rising at alarming rates throughout the developed world on the opposite end of the spectrum are young population societies india indonesia saudi arabia thailand most of africa much of latin america and many other emerging economies if they don t each generate at least hundreds of thousands of jobs per year for the next 10 years they will face an immense population of unrooted unsupported people most of these countries already have difficulties providing education and jobs for their young citizens and the challenge will get even more difficult as companies adopt automated manufacturing systems embedded with ai these countries won t be able to jump start their manufacturing industries as south korea and china did with low wage factory jobs because those jobs will be replaced by robots the tension raised by these soaring old and young populations can be summed up in a metric known as the age dependency ratio this is the percentage of people who cannot work and thus need economic support the figure is already almost double what it was in 1950 and is rising at an unprecedented rate see global age dependency ratio 1950 2050 these demographic issues are even more daunting when added to the negative consequences of asymmetry and disruption there is no clear view of how to design or fund an effective response and few institutions are confronting them with the requisite speed and creativity older countries may soon lose their capacity to support themselves and young countries will probably be overwhelmed by people looking for any way to make a living populism consensus fractured the week before the brexit vote in may 2016 a liverpool taxi driver told his u s passenger that he was voting to leave the european union he had grown up in liverpool he said but he no longer recognized the town two of his friends had given up their fishing business because of the catch limits imposed by the e u violent crime was increasing the pubs and restaurants he liked were closing he blamed all these shifts on decisions made in brussels his life was being changed he said by people he did not know whom he could not influence and who felt no accountability toward him my brexit vote is the most important decision of my life he said adding that he d studied the issue for a year then he summed up his opposition to the e u it s taxation and regulation without representation you started a revolution over this in america did you not when asked if he recognized the economic consequences of an exit he mused will it be worse than the second world war we survived that one the populist movement around the world is fueled by attitudes like this it should not be understood as allegiance to authoritarianism it is a basic combination of fear of future uncertainty and concerns about fairness when wages are stagnant for years the quality of life is poorer and the future is uncertain anxiety grows in the middle class people naturally experience their status and relevance as diminished and they worry that their children will be even worse off when the accumulation of great wealth in the hands of a few is conspicuous people perceive a basic lack of fairness in society they believe that institutions and political leaders are biased against them when uncertainty and unfairness are perceived as the overarching state of affairs people tend to vote more for populists and nationalists these political candidates seem to be the only ones who hear them as they want to be heard populist movements can lead politicians to support policies that often unintentionally have a chaotic effect on business for example they may involve retreating from global agreements governance structures and standards investment and innovation which rely on the free flow of ideas goods and people across boundaries are more difficult in the kind of closed border world favored by populism protectionist tariffs make it more difficult for businesses to compete and populism makes it increasingly difficult for global enterprises to defend or continue the international supply chain operations that have sustained them for decades the nationalist challenge has placed a burden of proof on global institutions to show that they are capable of answering the genuine demands that people have for a visibly better future no matter where they are located or what kind of work they do this will require sustainable solutions for several significant issues such as the growing number of weather related disasters the emotionally charged issue of immigration policy and the challenge of skill building solutions must come first only when fundamental issues are credibly understood and addressed will trust in society s institutions return we no longer live in a world in which movement toward liberal democracy and capitalism can be taken for granted it is doubtful that the world will return to a relatively simple global multilateral order there will be several competing political and economic models each dominant in a few regions the most influential large nations will have different views on how to compete economically on who should write the rules as in trade climate and financial regulation on how to share resources and on how to organize the interoperable platforms of digitally driven commerce the models may vary widely but they will also need to function effectively alongside one another the smaller countries will try to preserve their independence while navigating between these larger powers in the end the competition of ideas brought on by populism may be a blessing in disguise the older models are no longer perceived as advancing the common good and with luck new models will emerge that do a better job trust institutions disrespected in november 2018 when the group of 20 international forum g20 held its annual summit in buenos aires argentina a corruption scandal was dominating local headlines former argentine president cristina kirchner had been formally accused of being one of the leaders of a massive bribery network which included many of the country s business leaders a raft of similar cases had recently come to light starting in brazil and moving throughout latin america highlighted by a wave of media attention and facilitated by reforms in the criminal justice system the revelations were generally treated as damaging but not surprising commentators warned of indifference and scandal fatigue the average citizen in the region has long regarded corruption as a way of life feels little trust in government or other related institutions and assumes that no sustainable solution is likely latin america is not unique at a time of electronic media saturation and partisan political rancor when email hacks and political leaks occur regularly mistrust of institutions has become a worldwide phenomenon this has taken more of a toll than people realize the edelman trust barometer which has tracked the perception of institutional credibility since 2001 presents a sobering picture in 2019 the firm found a record high trust gap between the informed public and everyone else the first group college educated people age 25 to 64 in the top quarter of household income in their market reported significant engagement with news media and tended to have a positive view of society s institutions the rest of the population in aggregate was far more skeptical overall only about 20 percent of the entire global population said they felt the system was working for them institutions that have lost credibility are government corporations media schools and universities and religious organizations worse still a significant amount of the loss of trust reflects institutional bad behavior the 2008 financial crisis institutional leaks and a wide range of public disclosures of egregious acts have all contributed the net result is a broad body of people who do not trust any institution charged with shepherding their future consider for example france s yellow vest protests which began in opposition to a green fuel tax in the fall of 2018 no solution was considered sufficient because no one was trusted to deliver results without some trustworthy institutions civilization cannot fully function the sources of disruption themselves technology and social media are also increasingly seen as untrustworthy people are becoming preoccupied with privacy and security they see their personal data being stolen from sites they thought were secure learn of the manipulation of people through social media and find out about algorithms that facilitate the purchase of bomb materials without traceability as occurred in recent terrorist attacks in the united kingdom it s difficult to see how trust can be broadly restored but data from the edelman barometer offers some clues globally 75 percent of respondents trusted the enterprise they worked for a much higher figure than that for trust in media 47 percent government 48 percent business in general 56 percent or nongovernmental organizations 57 percent many of these respondents said they look to business as a catalyst for social change 71 percent agreed for example that it s critically important for my ceo to respond to challenging times to regain trust institutions have to be seen as functionally competent and as working for the common good schools businesses and governments are gradually learning what this means it means not just providing value to everyone who interacts with them but doing so in an engaging way so that the experience of interacting with them is welcome many efforts to do this in the past have been simplistic or insincere this time the stakes are high and halfhearted efforts will not suffice the lack of trust in organizations today is a sign that full scale renewal is needed as is a shift to a broader sense of purpose a catalyst for change if leaders are serious about restoring trust in mainstream institutions they have to think freshly about legitimacy and leverage many institutions day to day practices and ways of thinking have contributed to this crisis building trust requires changing habitual practices often at a large scale what are the fresh ideas for effectively addressing 21st century challenges we think these are the places to start take responsibility the issues described here are vast and it s easy to become inured to them but business leaders have to care about the results we need to create alternatives to a system that sets up new college graduates with massive personal debt and little opportunity that lets people retire broke with almost no safety net and that lets people in midcareer lose their jobs to automation and with them their homes and hope for their children s future we have to care about the middle class around the world to prevent it from being hollowed out we have to balance that with care about the poorest regions the regions at risk of drought flooding and neglect if we don t want these results funded in the long run by wealth redistribution we have to foster them in the short run through genuine commitment more effective management and smarter solutions move with rapid speed and at massive scale recognize the urgency and scope of the issues we must address we cannot take up time debating and conferring before acting for example finding education and work for 442 million people in africa over the next 10 years cannot be accomplished at the current pace of existing multinational institutions be local first in democratic systems international and national policy debates have become so polarized that we are unlikely to find the answers we need there nor can we fully trust authoritarian systems which have their own agendas during the next few years the most important role of international societies and national governments may be to step back and create the conditions that will allow local communities to thrive by solving problems they need to be set up to experiment pay attention to the results offer transparency and learn from their own experience and one another there is a better chance to build social cohesion and inclusive opportunity at the level of local communities if we can deploy our growing expertise to support them redefine success the prevailing economic focus on gdp growth and shareholder value has hidden the real harms people are experiencing national and global averages do not paint a full picture organizations must make decisions based on their more fundamental purpose to improve the world s value in human as well as economic terms they need to be held accountable to the success of the communities in which they operate countries need to refocus on overall societal well being and not just gdp growth humanize technology digital tools and media are unless programmed otherwise indifferent to their consequences it is up to people to ensure the effects are beneficial social media can produce accurate news technology can improve memory and attention and reduce depression and anxiety ai can replicate the best of us not the worst of us to ensure this happens we need more people to be digitally skilled and aware capable of driving better outcomes and more inclusive innovation reinvent our institutions tax systems can be made fairer capital markets can be made more accessible and effective educational systems can be brought up to date in both their methods and their curricula to instill the skills society needs we must engage our imagination to find new models of organizational practice and governance most of these new models involve new levels of transparency egregious practices which once seemed like they could be hidden will now be more likely to come to light rethink leadership perhaps most importantly we need to recognize the inherent paradoxes that leaders must navigate today to be technologically savvy and acutely focused on furthering humanity to heroically drive change but remain humble enough to recognize our limits to have the political skills to operate among diverse constituencies but not lose our integrity to prize that which came before and still drive massive innovation those who are followers members of businesses organizations and society should expect no less of their leaders everyone should recognize that at some moment in the near future each person will be called upon to lead in some small way these may seem like daunting or quixotic goals but they are achievable indeed many of them have matured in recent years away from earlier idealism and optimism and toward more pragmatic understanding but that too is reason for hope we don t know right now what solutions will work best for the crisis of legitimacy but we know that there will be great opportunities along with daunting challenges involved in finding out author profiles blair sheppard is

when you are marginalized by those who appropriate to themselves greater stakes in politics or economics your views are also seen as marginal so also everything about africa is seen either as marginal or at best as emerging nigeria being the most populous country in africa is still seen as marginal or an emerging economy so its budget can only take the shape of a marginal budget in a world dominated by knowledge economy as majority of its people remain in the margins of knowledge acquisition seventy percent in the north uneducated 11million out of school hence a budget of margins just for tiny portion of nigeria reacting as termites what i read in the budget of supposedly great economies of the west is how to reduce budget deficit not necessarily what they earn or what they spend though reducing budget deficit imply such issues as earnings and spending focus is on waste eliminator not to create ants to destroy their wealth it also implies that as long as people are productive and at work deficit reduction could mean an austerity measure which has never worked as stimulus has always prevailed basically the us congress refusal to approve 5billion border wall of the usa s president is to reduce the huge budget deficit that the usa has been incurring over the years 23trillion debt yet it is the economy rated as greatly performing with more people getting into the job market than any other country it is also known that the mayor of new york operates far greater capital budget than found in nigeria s current budget of mere n8trillion about 20 billion yet 23 of capable hands in nigeria are not finding jobs to enhance the overall economic carrying capacity of nigeria that shows greater marginalization upon which budgeting could only be seen as voodoo budgeting hinged on weak thinking or marginal thinking what is there to budget for when most nigerians seem to be on their own except the politicians marginal activity is what the proposed earning and spending of the budget is based and it could only yield marginal result that exclude the majority or operates in disdain of capable hands begging to be included so as to form the real norm yet to be used in the budgeting process one of the basics you learn in mba class that concerns accounting is that until average cost equates marginal cost where marginal cost is seen as the contribution of each activity in the assumed average cost of all activities remaining proportional to the value of such activity to the entire activity it is seen as not yet optimizing this is where subsidy tends to be seen as eroding optimization process in effect nigeria s budgeting process that always see the legislators raising the oil benchmark is completely a weak thinking process and quite a voodoo economic activity as generally the oil price is not determined by nigeria but by those who are directly or secretly in charge of both the oil pricing mechanism and its supply chain the leading powers and even the central bank of nigeria that must ensure that it does not release into nigeria s economy more than nigeria is contributing to the world albeit marginally vis à vis what such greater stakeholder see as partaking in the average costing of maintaining the global economy costed and regulated by seen and unseen hands of organizations like uno imf world bank nato etc these are strategic organizations incurring costs towards regulating world s economy and they are very strict in making sure that a given nation does not earn more that it deserves sanctions could be imposed or whatever they deem necessary to frustrate such nation s economic prospects nigeria has been clamouring to be among the 20 most developed economy in the world for decades and a small country like taiwan had been there for decades and taiwan basically operates its budget on earning as function of added value from whatever it is importing from others to reach at final products which is better in attaining optimization nigeria needs to think along that line in its budgeting process as against the legislators arbitrarily raising oil price like taiwan like south korea smaller in size but greater in gdp than nigeria the minimalist way of evaluating our legislators must be to see the laws that they are making that give nigerians and investors operating environment that encourages adding values to what the nigerian knowledge base its people and its resources comparative advantage prospects add in terms of national wealth for example it was known that south korea enacted a law and greatly marketed that law which enabled any investor in the 70s to come with a given amount of dollar and open industry with some tax free benefits as long as such industry engaged in exportable goods their aim was for foreign reserve booster and it worked some nigerians were known to have participated in the making of that prosperity it was even a time when people there were eager to acquire nigerian university degrees paying for it in dollars in south korea as nigeria takes back manufactured products like air conditioners fridge and computers today south korea is one of the 20 most industrialized nations from their former poor state in effect till nigeria starts getting out of the margins with its paltry earnings that is far below its optimization capacity it will be baseless discussing marginal budgetary presentation that makes more mockery of the system as legislators go into executive function of allocating more funds to themselves instead of questioning spending that do not reflect right earnings i have never heard any where that legislators make more appropriation to themselves as against either adopting or querying the spending patterns of the executive the current budget of about n8trillion does not reflect the production capacity of nigeria upon which taxation could be extracted from the entire nigeria s people and resources hence quite a marginal budget and as majority of

as the g 20 finance ministers and central bank governors gather this week in fukuoka they can take inspiration from their host city known as japan s startup city fukuoka has flourished in recent decades by embracing trade innovation and openness that spirit is needed more than ever to help reduce trade tensions and clear other stumbling blocks on the way back to higher and more sustainable growth the goal must be to help not stand in the way of global growth signs of stabilization in april i described the global economy as being at a delicate moment the imf cut its global growth forecast to 3 3 percent in 2019 largely because of temporary country specific factors and the tangible effects of trade tensions at the same time we projected a pickup in growth in the second half of this year and a further acceleration to 3 6 percent in 2020 the same growth rate as in 2018 our expectation was that global economic activity would also benefit from the more patient pace of monetary normalization by the us fed and the european central bank and from increased fiscal stimulus in china and indeed these policy responses have provided vital support over the past few months including by easing financial conditions and increasing capital flows to emerging markets in fact the most recent economic data indicate that global growth may be stabilizing broadly as we had forecast for example while first quarter economic activity disappointed in parts of emerging asia and latin america growth was stronger than expected in the united states the euro area and japan so there is some good news yet the road to stronger growth remains precarious why there are growing concerns over the impact of the current trade tensions significant stumbling blocks let me highlight some of the significant stumbling blocks that could stand in the way of a rebound in growth for one there are question marks over the expected uptick in growth will the first quarter momentum in advanced economies hold up and will the previously projected improvements in some stressed economies materialize or take longer than expected how would a no deal brexit affect confidence and will the recent increase in oil prices further depress economic activity another stumbling block is the underlying vulnerability of the global economy corporate debt levels for example have increased to a point where a sudden shift in financial conditions could trigger disruptive capital outflows from emerging markets we also know that many economies are facing disappointing medium term growth prospects not just because of population aging and slow productivity but also because of the corrosive effects of excessive economic inequality trade tensions are looming larger most importantly there are growing concerns over the impact of the current trade tensions the risk is that the most recent us china tariffs could further reduce investment productivity and growth the just proposed us tariffs on mexico are also of concern indeed there is strong evidence that the united states china and the world economy are the losers from the current trade tensions see chart we estimate that the recently announced and envisaged us china tariffs could subtract about 0 3 percent from global gdp in 2020 with more than half of the impact stemming from business confidence effects and negative financial market sentiment overall we estimate that us china tariffs including those implemented last year could reduce global gdp by 0 5 percent in 2020 see chart bottom panel this amounts to a loss of about us 455 billion larger than the size of south africa s economy these are self inflicted wounds that must be avoided how by removing the recently implemented trade barriers and by avoiding further barriers in whatever form the fact is that protectionist measures are not only hurting growth and jobs but they are also making tradable consumer goods less affordable and disproportionately harming low income households the g 20 can help so how can g 20 policymakers help to clear these stumbling blocks and support a rebound in growth the immediate priority is to resolve the current trade tensions while stepping up the modernization of the international trade system this includes building consensus across countries on how to strengthen wto rules especially on subsidies intellectual property and trade in services the goal is to create a more open more stable and more transparent trade system one that is well equipped to serve the needs of 21st century economies for example imf research shows that liberalizing trade in services could add about us 350 billion to global gdp in the long run these types of gains are critical if trade is to play its role in lifting living standards and creating new jobs with higher wages as countries are fixing the trade system they also need to work together to reform international corporate taxation strengthen the global financial safety net and tackle the existential threat of climate change strengthening resilience and inclusiveness at the same time we have to recognize that high public debt and low interest rates have left many countries with limited policy room for maneuver managing this challenge will require carefully calibrated fiscal policies that strike the right balance between growth debt sustainability and social objectives we also need to address dislocations caused by trade and technological innovation while doing more to support those left behind and we need further structural reforms from lowering barriers to entry in retail and professional services to encouraging greater participation of women in the workforce of course each country will customize reforms to meet its needs but we estimate that these types of measures if jointly implemented could boost g 20 gdp by 4 percent in the long term importantly structural reforms would also make growth more resilient and inclusive coordinate if growth falters even as we strive to support a pickup in growth in this way countries need to ask what if when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will policymakers may need to use all policy tools to maximize their combined effect this means supporting demand through decisive monetary easing and fiscal stimulus wherever possible it also means using these supportive policies to boost the impact of structural reforms where demand is weak our g 20 note simulates a negative economic shock and the subsequent policy responses see chart top panel under one scenario if all policy tools are used g 20 output recovers significantly faster and more sustainably moreover policy coordination should not stop at the border our downturn simulation shows that if all countries act decisively to stimulate their own growth the positive spillovers reinforce each other and if everyone is working to expand growth everyone benefits from the efforts of others to a much greater effect overall see chart bottom panel conclusion of course international cooperation is not just required in a potential downturn it is critical right now because all countries continue to face a delicate moment as the japanese proverb goes cross a shallow river as if it were deep for the g 20 nations crossing the river means working in partnership to help not hinder the expected pickup in growth

washington s finances cannot be fixed without a significant reduction in the growth rate of spending or large tax increases on the middle class the congressional budget office estimates that spending will exceed revenues by 900 billion in 2019 the actual number will be even larger if congress passes emergency or infrastructure spending packages this year ref if current policy continues in 10 years the 2029 budget deficit will likely exceed 2 trillion in that year alone ref as a matter of mathematical certainty large and growing budget deficits cannot continue forever ref politicians both republicans and democrats have shown little desire to control the rate of spending growth recent proposals such as medicare for all free college a national job guarantee paid family and medical leave and the green new deal are conservatively estimated to cost more than 50 trillion over 10 years or about 5 trillion a year ref a 5 trillion increase in outlays would more than double the 4 4 trillion 2019 federal budget without controls on spending growth congress will eventually raise taxes popular proposals to raise taxes on the rich are insufficient to cover the current level of government spending let alone the 50 trillion european style welfare state agenda combined the popularly discussed wealth tax 70 percent top tax rate and a financial transactions tax would in the most optimistic scenarios raise about 300 billion a year ref that is about a third of the current budget deficit 15 percent of the projected current policy 2029 budget deficit or just 6 percent of the new spending called for by prominent progressives although few countries have all the programs currently being proposed by the progressive left in the u s expansive government services and government run health care exist around the world especially in europe if americans want european style government services they should be ready for european style taxes european welfare states do not rely on overly progressive tax systems instead they use broad based taxes like the value added tax vat high payroll taxes and relatively flat income taxes which fall primarily on taxpayers in the middle of the income distribution if congress continues to look to europe as a model for its spending policy congress will eventually adopt the european tax policy too on average about 37 percent of all economic activity is taxed by the governments of the 23 countries that are members of the european union as well as of the organization for economic co operation and development eu oecd ref in the u s taxes consume 27 percent of economic output to raise large amounts of tax revenue many of these countries implement marginal wage tax rates of 50 percent or more on all income earned over 37 000 a year a below average wage higher incomes are taxed at even higher rates european style sales taxes on goods and services called vats have rates above 20 percent on average such high taxes would not be a desirable outcome for any american s economic well being but voters and the congress they elect should be adequately acquainted with the reality of funding big government how do u s taxes compare to europe the united states is not a high tax country compared to our european counterparts the total level of taxation is important because it represents a sort of average countrywide tax rate and shows how much of the economy is driven by politics rather than markets across the eu oecd seven countries have governments that tax over 40 percent of the economic activity see chart 1 in the united states federal state and local taxes consume about 27 percent of output gross domestic product gdp the composition of how that revenue is raised also varies greatly across the eu oecd chart 2 shows that individual income taxes payroll taxes and vats comprise the largest portions of most countries tax revenue the breakdown by each country can be found in the appendix taxing wages to fund big government wage taxes make up the single largest share of tax revenue for every eu oecd country wage taxes can be expressed as the marginal and average tax wedge on labor income by combining income taxes employee payroll taxes and employer payroll taxes at each level of government although the employer legally writes the check for some payroll taxes economists generally agree that workers bear the entire cost of the payroll tax through lower wages the marginal tax wedge represents how much tax a worker must pay on the next dollar of income earned if a worker is considering driving for uber on the weekends for a little additional income the marginal tax wedge shows how much of that additional income the worker would get to keep high marginal taxes reduce the incentive for him to take the extra job or work as hard to get a raise or promotion the marginal tax on wages is above 40 percent on workers earning 37 000 a year 67 percent of the country s average earnings in all but three of the eu oecd countries for a single worker with no children ref in the united states a single person making 37 000 a year faced a marginal tax wedge of 32 percent in 2018 lower than in any eu oecd country in eight countries marginal taxes are above 50 percent for the same below average wage worker in france and belgium marginal rates on below average incomes are 70 percent and 68 percent respectively chart 3 shows that the marginal tax wedge tends to be higher in countries with higher tax burdens measured by tax revenues as a percent of gdp in 2017 the average tax wedge divides total taxes paid on wages by what the worker would have earned without taxes chart 3 shows that over one third of potential income is taxed away in all but three countries for a single worker with no children making 67 percent of the country s average earnings in eight countries the average tax rate is above 40 percent the u s has the third lowest average tax wedge of 28 percent behind ireland 24 percent and the u k 26 percent workers earning above the average wage pay even higher taxes than low wage workers in most countries across europe the marginal tax on wages is above 50 percent on workers earning close to 92 000 167 percent of the average wage in 13 of the eu oecd countries for a single worker with no children ref the united states had the second lowest marginal tax wedge of 41 percent behind poland 37 percent in 2018 appendix chart 2 shows three countries have marginal taxes above 60 percent and sweden s top rate is just shy of 70 percent for workers earning 167 percent of the average wage measured by the average tax wedge for above average wage workers over half of the income that workers making 92 000 a year earn is taxed away in six countries in all but three countries the average tax rate is above 40 percent the u s has the lowest average tax wedge of 34 percent looking just at income taxes excluding payroll taxes many eu oecd countries apply their top marginal income tax rates to average or close to average income earners as shown in chart 4 in 11 eu oecd countries top combined federal and sub federal income tax rates apply to people with less than two times the average country wage in the u s that would mean individuals making more than about 110 000 a year would face a federal marginal income tax rate 13 percentage points higher than they pay currently the u s has the fifth highest income tax threshold among the eu oecd across europe countries apply their highest tax rates to a much larger share of their citizen s income than in the u s compared to the u s top combined marginal income tax rates are higher in 15 of the 23 eu oecd countries sweden denmark greece france and austria all have top rates of 55 percent or higher five nations have a top tax bracket of 50 percent or higher and an income threshold of less than twice the national average sweden and denmark s 57 percent and 56 percent marginal rates apply to incomes that are 1 5 percent and 1 3 percent of the average respectively a 70 percent tax rate on incomes over 10 million as has been proposed by some u s lawmakers would make the u s an even more extreme outlier the proposal would mean the u s would have the highest marginal tax rate among our european counterparts and the high rate would apply to incomes about 180 times the national average ref such highly progressive systems do not raise much revenue if any and create economically destructive incentives for the most productive people in the country ref countries that choose to have large social and redistributive programs cannot rely only on taxes on the rich for funding as the data show countries that have larger governments than the u s use high taxes on low income and middle class workers to foot the bill taxing consumption to fund big government across all levels of government the u s relies on consumption taxes much less than any eu oecd country chart 2 shows that 15 8 percent of all u s state and federal revenue comes from taxes on goods and services across europe consumption taxes are the largest single source of revenue comprising 32 8 percent the united states is the only country in the oecd that does not use a vat to raise a majority of consumption tax revenue the vat is a type of national sales tax that is collected by businesses at each stage of production rather than at the cash register in the u s most of the consumption tax revenue is collected by state governments through a sales tax at the point of sale the u s federal government does not collect a broad based consumption tax across all countries a small portion of consumption tax revenue is raised through excise taxes on specific products like cigarettes and alcohol in addition to higher wage tax rates than the u s eu oecd countries also have significantly higher consumption tax rates the average eu oecd standard vat rate was 21 8 percent in 2016 ref the average state and local sales tax rate across the 50 u s states and the district of columbia was 6 4 percent in the same year ref vats have at least three features that make them important components of paying for big government first lawmakers are able to raise more revenue with a vat than they can with wage and corporate income taxes alone because the vat is such an efficient way to raise revenue compared to most other taxes lawmakers can increase the size of government well beyond the size that could be supported by less efficient income taxes alone ref vats are also not always as visible as sales taxes because they are collected at each stage of production and often included in the posted price rather than added on at the point of sale second vats are another way to raise taxes on lower income and middle class taxpayers because everyone has to buy goods and services unlike income taxes where large portions of income can be excluded from tax and rates can be set higher for high income earners everyone pays the same vat rates the vat distributes the tax burden more evenly across all taxpayers because many observers wrongly think the vat is regressive it is often paired with large redistributive policies to compensate low income earners for the higher taxes further growing the size of government ref third the vat is not only paid by working age income earners but also by non income earning retirees in aging western countries where social programs for retirees continue to consume larger portions of current government expenditures vats are a convenient way to make retirees shoulder some of the burden of paying for their overpromised benefits ref the vat is often sold politically as a revenue neutral substitute for other unpopular or economically harmful taxes while such a tax swap is an interesting thought experiment in the real world a vat usually leads to higher income taxes and overall higher government spending ref historically the vat is associated with growing the size and scope of government not making it more efficient ref a progressive road map to taxing the middle class relative to the eu oecd average the u s is the second lowest tax country by revenue raised as a percent of gdp however the true level of taxation is the level of spending even after accounting for large deficits the u s is the fourth smallest government when measured by expenditures as a percent of gdp compared to the eu oecd simply raising enough tax revenue in the u s to meet current spending will require significant tax increases paying for even a small portion of the progressive agenda will require tax increases on the order of double or triple what most americans pay today there is simply not enough money held or earned by wealthy taxpayers to fund government spending at levels seen across europe for the government to tax and spend half or more of all economic output each year it must employ high taxes that fall squarely on the majority of citizens looking to europe it is evident that high taxes on the rich alone are not sufficient to pay for the progressive agenda big government requires high taxes on consumption and high taxes on lower income and middle class wages in addition to other taxes on businesses and property as a matter of arithmetic typical taxpayers must be on the hook for expansive government spending the progressive rhetoric about raising taxes on the rich is only half the political story u s tax history lends further color to the progressive strategy to leverage narrow taxes on the rich into mass taxes on everyone first raising taxes on the rich provides political cover to later raise taxes on middle income earners tax historian joseph thorndike explains that high marginal income tax rates in the new deal era were used to help justify regressive consumption taxes on alcohol and tobacco which supplied anywhere from a third to half of federal revenue during the early 1930s ref again in the 1940s he explains that high marginal tax rates of 90 plus percent were used to provide political cover for a dramatic downward expansion of the income tax ref prominent supporters of more federal spending on health care education environmental policy and income supports point to america s history of higher top marginal tax rates as evidence that the country should do it again what they leave out of the story is that high income taxpayers did not actually pay more in total taxes when top rates were as high as 90 percent avoidance was high and the tax base was narrow and easily planned around ref historically high tax rates have not only been about making the rich pay more instead high marginal tax rates help build political support for more taxes on everyone else as is clear when looking at the european fiscal model large welfare states cannot be sustained by primarily taxing any narrow segment of the population everyone must pay for big government the cost of high taxes is more than the direct costs all taxes have economic costs too even if they are turned into widely available benefit programs the economic cost of taxes ultimately affects citizens through lower wages increased prices and less economic opportunity businesses and capital gains taxes decrease investment which slows wage growth and job creation ref wage taxes often mean that people work fewer hours and choose to be less innovative slowing entrepreneurship ref consumption taxes increase prices decrease consumer s standards of living and negatively affect employment and investment incentives big government requires high taxes and high taxes have large negative effects on the well being of every american a different path if american fiscal policy continues to follow the lead of europe the tax policies of europe will invariably have to follow americans still have a choice by not adding any new spending programs and reforming the largest drivers of future deficits medicare medicaid obamacare and social security it is possible to balance the budget and begin paying down the debt over time the heritage foundation s 2020 blueprint for balance presents one road map to balancing the budget without raising taxes by 2029 ref even in the absence of new federal spending programs tough choices must be made the rate of growth of federal spending is currently growing faster than both the economy and tax collections if current spending growth is not slowed down taxes will eventually increase significantly for all taxpayers there are no other sustainable options adam n michel is senior policy

us dollar stabilizes after roller coaster session amid mixed data and little progress in us mexico talks euro eases from 7 week highs as ecb meeting eyed for direction oil plunges on rising stocks global growth jitters but gold soars fragile risk sentiment as hopes of mexico deal fade markets were mostly in a risk averse mood on thursday as hopes of a quick deal between the united states and mexico over illegal migration were dashed after president trump tweeted yesterday that not nearly enough progress is being made in the talks his comments raised the prospect of another prolonged trade conflict for the us as talks with china remain at a standstill and increase the likelihood that 5 tariffs on all mexican imports will go ahead on june 10 even as negotiations are set to continue today mexico has prepared a list of us products that it could target in retaliatory tariffs should a resolution not be found though there s still some optimism that the two sides will be able to reach some sort of an agreement to ease the migration pressure rough ride for dollar and peso the mexican peso fell sharply on the disappointing headlines falling back towards the 5 month low of 19 60 brushed earlier this week further weighing on the peso were ratings downgrades by fitch and moody s as lower oil prices and the possibility of us tariffs darkened the county s economic outlook the dollar wasn t having a particularly better time either amid mixed signals about the us economy the greenback took a big tumble yesterday on a shockingly weak private employment survey by adp pointing to a potentially poor jobs report on friday however much a stronger than expected ism non manufacturing pmi for may later helped the us currency bounce back the dollar index has recovered to around 97 30 after plunging to a two month trough of 96 75 yesterday but against the safe haven yen the dollar was struggling again today slipping to around 108 20 yen as treasury yields headed back down on rising expectations that the fed will cut rates later this year falling yields and dollar lift gold the growing odds that the fed will be forced to ease monetary policy later this year to counter the negative impact from the worsening trade and geopolitical tensions have been a big boost for gold the precious metal surged to a 3½ month high of 1343 86 an ounce before settling lower around 1334 gold has been unable to benefit as much as other safe havens from the recent deterioration in risk appetite as it s been held back from a strong dollar it stands to make more substantial gains should the fed begin to provide clearer signals of a rate cut in contrast oil prices were struggling near 4½ month lows as the weakening global growth backdrop weighed on the demand outlook further pressuring oil was a huge jump in us crude stocks in the latest weekly eia inventory data which sent wti briefly diving below the 51 a barrel euro looks to ecb for more stimulus the european central bank will announce its latest decision today at 11 45 gmt followed by president mario draghi s press conference at 12 30 gmt no change in policy is expected but the ecb will probably outline the full details of its previously announced tltro 3 program it s also possible to central bank could adjust its forward guidance in interest rates if its latest economic projections contain sharp downward revisions but investors will mainly be watching for clues from draghi that the ecb stands ready to increase stimulus should growth and inflation in the euro area not pick up in the near future the euro hit a 7 week high of 1 1306 yesterday before climbing down to around 1 1230 as the dollar recovered and traders grew wary of another major clash between italy and the european commission all the indications so far are that italy s leaders are not willing to budge on their existing spending pledges raising the prospect of another stand off in the coming months in the meantime the euro faces an immediate risk from a dovish draghi which threatens to undo the currency s modest rebound versus the dollar over the past week
new york cnn business democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren wants a cheaper us dollar to help american exports and create jobs that s one issue she and president donald trump agree on america s currency should be managed more actively she said in a medium post tuesday in which she unveiled her plan to create and defend american jobs the american economy could benefit from a weaker dollar because it could make american made goods cheaper and thus more attractive on the global markets but warren s plan has plenty of skeptics it would be difficult to achieve the desired effect of growing us exports and american workers wages and it could erode trust in the dollar as a global mode of payments the idea that a weaker dollar would be instrumental to american prosperity shows a profound misunderstanding of how the global economy works said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex in response to warren s plan other countries particularly in emerging markets could benefit from a lower greenback suggested td securities global head of fx strategy mark mccormick after the financial crisis many countries incurred debt denominated in dollars if the buck went down in value so would their debt burdens but forcing the dollar lower is easier said than done intervening in the currency market to make american exports more competitive to create jobs at home is not something a president can do with the snap of a finger the strong dollar and trade in her post warren said the strong dollar is hurting american exports and is the most important factor in the united states large trade deficit to get out of this dilemma the united states should be more actively managing our currency value to promote exports and domestic manufacturing she wrote noting other countries lower the value of their currencies to boost exports and local industries warren s strategy ignores the complex nature of a global supply chain said mccormick a weaker currency really doesn t boost export growth this idea only makes sense in a very simplistic world said mark mccormick today companies supply chains are more sophisticated and integrated allowing them to mitigate currency fluctuations while goods are shipped back and forth before reaching the consumer for example parts of a car manufactured in the united states may cross the canadian and mexican borders multiple times mccormick said and creating jobs in the united states is too tall a task for exchange rate manipulation alone to achieve the difference between workers wages in the united states and elsewhere in the world can be substantial devaluing the dollar can t overcome that gap said mccormick warren s campaign declined to comment currency wars like warren trump has also called the dollar too strong he has described china russia and the european union as currency manipulators but the us treasury has refrained from officially calling them out america has put pressure on china to stabilize its currency during its trade negotiations that could get awkward if the united states starts manipulating its own currency it is hard for us to tell china to tell their currency should be moved by market forces and then have a serious contender for the white house who wants to devalue the dollar said chandler if the united states government unilaterally decided to devalue its currency other countries would probably follow a number of currencies are also pegged to the dollar such as the hong kong dollar and the currencies of middle eastern oil exporters like saudi arabia after all oil is traded in dollars if we have a devaluationist in the white house investors will want higher interest rates to be compensated for the higher currency risk suggested chandler even if warren or trump pursued a plan to devalue the dollar the president couldn t do much to change the currency s value on his or her own the president would have to have the us treasury in consultation with the independent federal reserve on board with the plan to execute it something that seems incredibly unlikely for any us president unless there were extreme circumstances that warranted intervention said brad bechtel managing director in foreign exchange at jefferies the world s reserve currency a unilateral move by washington could erode the trust in the institutional foundations of the dollar as the world s foremost reserve currency warren s plan would involve other countries that she believes have been harmed by currency misalignment the united states should consider working with other countries to produce a currency value that s better for our workers and our industries wrote warren she didn t share which countries she believed suffered from that issue or how their cooperation should work after all currencies trade in pairs so a multilateral agreement to weaken the dollar would in turn increase the value of for example the euro or the british pound that plan would be tricky because the dollar is still king in worldwide transactions an reserves countries by way of their central banks and international institutions hold dollars in their reserve arsenal to minimize exchange rate risk and pay for investments conventional wisdom dictates that a reserve currency has to be freely floating allowing its value to be determined by market forces and not by government policy which could change on a whim and not in line with trading fundamentals to be sure the dollar isn t the only reserve currency the euro is one too as is the british pound which was the world s reserve favorite before the dollar s reign recently some central banks have also indicated they would increase their reserves of the chinese yuan which is not a free floating currency the yuan s value can only fluctuate in a defined range manipulating the dollar could make it less appealing as a top reserve currency which is a status the united states has enjoyed for decades the fact that the world holds and deals in dollars makes the greenback the most powerful currency on earth

partner for realisation comments questions let us know what you think of before the bell timothy moore fairfaxmedia com au
by lance roberts on tuesday federal reserve chairman jerome powell in his opening remarks at a monetary policy conference in chicago raised concerns about the rising trade tensions in the u s we do not know how or when these issues will be resolved as always we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective however while there was nothing new in that comment it was his following statement that sent shorts scrambling to cover in short the proximity of interest rates to the elb has become the preeminent monetary policy challenge of our time tainting all manner of issues with elb risk and imbuing many old challenges with greater significance perhaps it is time to retire the term unconventional when referring to tools that were used in the crisis we know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some form in future elb spells which we hope will be rare as zerohedge noted to translate that statement not only is the fed ready to cut rates but it may take unconventional tools during the next recession i e nirp and even more qe this is a very interesting statement considering that these tools which were indeed unconventional emergency measures at the time have now become standard operating procedure for the fed yet these policy tools are still untested clearly qe worked well in lifting asset prices but not so much for the economy in other words qe was ultimately a massive wealth transfer from the middle class to the rich which has created one of the greatest wealth gaps in the history of the u s not to mention an asset bubble of historic proportions however they have yet to operate within the confines of an economic recession or a mean reverting event in the financial markets in simpler terms no one knows for certain whether the bubbles created by monetary policies are infinitely sustainable or what the consequences will be if they aren t the other concern with restarting monetary policy at this stage of the financial cycle is the backdrop is not conducive for emergency measures to be effective as we wrote in qe then now why it may not work if the market fell into a recession tomorrow the fed would be starting with roughly a 4 trillion balance sheet with interest rates 2 lower than they were in 2009 in other words the ability of the fed to bail out the markets today is much more limited than it was in 2008 but there is more to the story than just the fed s balance sheet and funds rate the entire backdrop is completely reversed the table below compares a variety of financial and economic factors from 2009 to present the critical point here is that qe and rate reductions have the most effect when the economy markets and investors have been blown out deviations from the norm are negatively extended confidence is hugely negative in other words there is nowhere to go but up the extremely negative environment that existed particularly in the asset markets provided a fertile starting point for monetary interventions today as shown in the table above the economic and fundamental backdrop could not be more diametrically opposed this suggests that the fed s ability to stem the decline of the next recession or offset a financial shock to the economy from falling asset prices may be much more limited than the fed and most investors currently believe while powell is hinting at qe4 it likely will only be employed when rate reductions aren t enough such was noted in 2016 by david reifschneider deputy director of the division of research and statistics for the federal reserve board in washington d c released a staff working paper entitled gauging the ability of the fomc to respond to future recessions the conclusion was simply this simulations of the frb us model of a severe recession suggest that large scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate should be able to provide enough additional accommodation to fully compensate for a more limited to cut short term interest rates in most but probably not all circumstances in effect powell has become aware he has become caught in a liquidity trap without continued emergency measures the markets and subsequently economic growth can not be sustained this is where david compared three policy approaches to offset the next recession fed funds goes into negative territory but there is no breakdown in the structure of economic relationships fed funds returns to zero and keeps it there long enough for unemployment to return to baseline fed funds returns to zero and the fomc augments it with additional 2 4 trillion of qe and forward guidance this is exactly the prescription that jerome powell laid out on tuesday suggesting the fed is already factoring in a scenario in which a shock to the economy leads to additional qe of either 2 trillion or in a worst case scenario 4 trillion effectively doubling the current size of the fed s balance sheet this is also why 10 year treasury rates are going to zero why rates are going to zero i have been discussing over the last couple of years why the death of the bond bull market has been greatly exaggerated to wit also read the bond bull market we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us there is an assumption that because interest rates are low that the bond bull market has come to its inevitable conclusion the problem with this assumption is three fold all interest rates are relative with more than 10 trillion in debt globally sporting negative interest rates the assumption that rates in the u s are about to spike higher is likely wrong higher yields in u s debt attracts flows of capital from countries with negative yields which push rates lower in the u s given the current push by central banks globally to suppress interest rates to keep nascent economic growth going an eventual zero yield on u s debt is not unrealistic the coming budget deficit balloon given the lack of fiscal policy controls in washington and promises of continued largesse in the future the budget deficit is set to swell back to 1 trillion or more in the coming years this will require more government bond issuance to fund future expenditures which will be magnified during the next recessionary spat as tax revenue falls central banks will continue to be a buyer of bonds to maintain the current status quo but will become more aggressive buyers during the next recession the next qe program by the fed to offset the next economic recession will likely be 2 4 trillion which will push the 10 year yield towards zero it s item 3 that is most important in debt deficits a slow motion train wreck i laid out the data constructs behind the points above however it was in april 2016 when i stated that with more government spending a budget deficit heading towards 1 trillion and real economic growth running well below expectations the demand for bonds would continue to grow even from a purely technical perspective the trend of interest rates suggested at that time a rate below one percent was likely during the next economic recession outside of other events such as the s l crisis asian contagion long term capital management etc which all drove money out of stocks and into bonds pushing rates lower recessionary environments are especially prone at suppressing rates further but given the inflation of multiple asset bubbles a credit driven event that impacts the corporate bond market will drive rates to zero furthermore given rates are already negative in many parts of the world which will likely be even more negative during a global recessionary environment zero yields will still remain more attractive to foreign investors this will be from both a potential capital appreciation perspective expectations of negative rates in the u s and the perceived safety and liquidity of the u s treasury market rates are ultimately directly impacted by the strength of economic growth and the demand for credit while short term dynamics may move rates ultimately the fundamentals combined with the demand for safety and liquidity will be the ultimate arbiter with the majority of yield curves that we track now inverted many economic indicators flashing red and financial markets dependent on fed action rather than strong fundamentals it is likely the bond market already knows a problem in brewing however while i am fairly certain the facts will play out as they have historically rest assured that if the facts do indeed change i will gladly change my view currently there is no evidence that a change of facts has occurred of course we aren t the only ones expecting rates to go to zero as bloomberg noted billionaire stan druckenmiller said he could see the fed funds rate going to zero in the next 18 months if the economy softens and that he recently piled into treasuries as the u s trade war with china escalated when the trump tweet went out i went from 93 invested to net flat and bought a bunch of treasuries druckenmiller said monday evening referring to the may 5 tweet from president donald trump threatening an increase in tariffs on china not because i m trying to make money i just don t want to play in this environment it has taken a massive amount of interventions by central banks to keep economies afloat globally over the last decade and there is rising evidence that growth is beginning to decelerate while another 2 4 trillion in qe might indeed be successful in further inflating the third bubble in asset prices since the turn of the century there is a finite ability to continue to pull forward future consumption to stimulate economic activity in other words there are only so many autos houses etc which can be purchased within a given cycle there is evidence the cycle peak has been reached if i am correct and the effectiveness of rate reductions and qe are diminished due to the reasons detailed herein the subsequent destruction to the wealth effect will be far larger than currently imagined there is a limit to just how many bonds the federal reserve can buy and a deep recession will likely find the fed powerless to offset much of the negative effects if more qe works great but as investors with our retirement savings at risk what if it doesn t

moment further rise is still currently in favor and break of 1 1309 will extend the rebound from 1 1107 short term bottom to 1 1448 key resistance decisive break there will carry larger bullish implications however break of 1 1200 should now confirm completion of the rebound from 1 1107 intraday bias will then be turned back to the downside for 1 1107 low instead in the bigger picture down

source benutzer zaufatch accessed in wikimedia commons june 4 marked the 30th anniversary of the chinese government s crackdown on and massacre of tiananmen square protestors and innocent bystanders that anniversary comes this year in the midst of the worst spate of trade tensions between china and the united states since the u s established diplomatic relations with china and china began its reform and opening policies those policies and u s china relations have anniversaries to celebrate this year as well both were announced in december 1978 so we re just halfway through the 40th anniversary year marking the process that gradually transformed china from an industrializing but poor centrally planned economy into a hybrid market cum state economy belonging to the ranks of the world s high middle income countries a world bank classification which china shares with countries like brazil mexico and malaysia reform and opening in china were but a decade old when the tiananmen violence occurred china s new economic strategy the communist party s declaration with tanks and bullets that the reform was to be economic only and today s trade war are all parts of one piece first we can set a few things straight china was not entirely an economic basket case in 1979 when it moved from its about face of being on the left of the soviet union with respect to egalitarianism and suppression of market forces to embracing those forces as key to a new socialism with chinese characteristics the best available estimates suggest that its total output value grew at about 6 per year between 1952 and 1979 with heavy industrial output growing much faster than consumer goods non staple crops and services comparisons indicate that despite the numerous policy swings between ultra leftists supported by mao zedong and more pragmatic bureaucratic plan advocates like deng xiaoping and zhou enlai and despite political and economic calamities caused by the great leap forward 1959 60 and the launching of the cultural revolution 1966 69 the three decades between the ascension to power of the ccp and the beginning of reform and opening saw considerably higher rates of economic growth more rapid rates of basic industrialization and far better improvements in life expectancy and literacy than in india china s fellow asian mega country which began independence at a similar level of poverty and which passed through the same years under a bureaucratically supervised capitalist and politically democratic system what proved most intolerable to would be modernizers like deng was not the complete absence of progress under the planned economy but the glaringly poor comparison with taiwan south korea and hong kong s paces of catching up with the industrialized west that and the sense that china had been holding itself back through ideological rigidity and that it could almost double its growth pace if it seized the opportunities that relative poverty a largely healthy and disciplined workforce a long coastline and abundance of ports and geographic and cultural proximity to the fastest growing economies in the world afforded it did the u s and the other western countries aid and abet china s economic rise after 1979 absolutely i clearly recall sitting in numerous seminars at the u s universities i attended in the late 1970s and being told again and again that china would never be able to follow in the footsteps of taiwan and s korea were it to try such a thing because their rapid growth had relied heavily on exporting to relatively open western markets such markets many economists felt could absorb the manufactures of some small strategically allied countries but would never be left so open to the greater flow of manufactures from an export oriented continent sized country with many times the populations of taiwan and s korea and yet when china proceeded to follow those japan inspired growth models by establishing special economic zones along its southeastern coast and inviting private investment investment that proceeded to flow especially rapidly from an overseas chinese diaspora possessed of approximately the same volume of capital in private hands as the nation of china had accumulated in public hands during its three decades of central planning the u s and other western markets proved remarkably open far from boycotting chinese goods in order to contain china the primary response was to celebrate the fact that china seemed to be abandoning communism and to welcome its entrance into world markets while gradually tutoring it in that market s rules major second thoughts followed the brutal 1989 crackdown beijing university students had taken advantage of the relatively liberal atmosphere permitted by the recently purged and then deceased hu yaobang and by his successor and reformist partner zhao ziyang they had begun staging protests on a larger scale than had been witnessed since the early months of the maoist cultural revolution and the government was showing surprising forbearance events then took a surreal turn top u s and european television news anchormen and camera crews descended on beijing in mid may 1989 to cover the historic visit of mikhail gorbachev itself marking an effort to turn the page on a sino soviet dispute that had been roiling world political waters since 1960 including the spawning of several proxy wars between opposing militias in africa the demonstrators realized that the government couldn t stage a crack down in china s central political square in front of so many cameras and the number of demonstrators ballooned with similar demonstrations beginning in many other cities once gorbachev and some of the cameras were gone china tried using local troops to clear the square but beijing residents stood up for the demonstrators and the local army units accepted flowers from them and refused to crack down with many protestors believing they had outmaneuvered the government deng xiaoping and hardliners dismissed the too tolerant zhao brought in loyal army units from more remote regions in the dead of the night of june 3 and turned the area around tiananmen square into a battle scene with uncounted numbers of dead the burst of unrestrained killing followed by months of political education and propaganda convinced the public that political reform was off the table and that their survival required silence the west greeted as heroes those protest leaders who managed to be smuggled out china safely and many voices were raised to call for strong sanctions against china s government foreign investment briefly declined and the harder line communist elements who replaced zhao even flirted with scuttling some 1980s era reforms but within three years deng succeeded in drumming up a new burst of reform and foreign investment started to rise on an unprecedented scale soon a new generation of chinese leaders committed to both rapid economic growth using a blend of the e asian export promotion model massive state investment in supporting industries and infrastructure and bottom up entrepreneurial spirit in city and countryside were planning to meet the requirements for wto entry which would further ramp up chinese export growth and guarantee growth of the market side of the hybrid economy even they probably didn t realize how little of the state control side of this hybrid they would really be required to concede to achieve the bargain by the 2010s the chinese government was sitting atop mountains of foreign currency buying companies and geostrategic access around the world and investing massively to bring its scientific and technological capabilities up to the international frontier and in some areas even to begin surpassing a u s whose anti state ideology was starving its scientific labs of proper funding was it a mistake for the west to permit china s economic rise without demanding more political reforms we clearly have to answer in the affirmative if we re thinking of the tens of thousands of han chinese dissidents still in prisons and re education camps or under house arrest or of the millions of uyghurs tibetans and other minorities being imprisoned and seeing their ancestral lands be systematically sinicized by growing ethnic han populations or of the millions of chinese men who will be unable to find wives due to the gender imbalance created by the excesses of china s one child policy or of the tens of millions of missing or unborn chinese women or of the hundreds of thousands who will be victims of petty violence caused by the attendant social stresses etc etc we have to answer in the affirmative if we think that china s transition from scandinavian like low levels of inequality to guatemala like heights of economic inequality is not entirely a good thing we have to answer in the affirmative if we think of the hundreds of millions of chinese who grew up in ignorance of their government s blatant trampling on basic human rights and values and of the tens of thousands who continue to leave china year after year to seek out better lives in freer countries robbing their nation of its best and brightest but the question on the strictly economic side of the ledger is more complicated in brief china s economy achieved the longest period of the highest sustained economic growth for any large nation in the world s economic history thanks in part to its openness to the entrepreneurial energies of investors from taiwan hong kong s korea and other countries and to the openness of markets like that of the u s to the products this juggernaut has been pumping out decade after decade domestic entrepreneurship and energy including the impressive efforts of local leaders in tens of thousands of china s rural towns and small cities also contributed its part the average incomes of china s people have more than quintupled since economic reforms began a feat unrivaled in human history though income gains within china have been extremely unequal almost everyone has gained a little and at least half a billion people have gone from global poverty standards of 2 or 3 a day worth of consumption to joining the world s middle and upper middle classes not to mention the tens of thousands who have joined the world s rich the costs of the vast majority of consumer goods in the united states from shoes clothing and sporting equipment to smartphones tv sets and computers have risen less rapidly than would otherwise have been expected thanks to the relatively low wages and efficiency of chinese production contributing considerably to americans abilities to maintain their lifestyles despite stagnant incomes for the lower 90 numerous countries in africa central asia and other regions have seen improvements in rates of economic growth thanks to china s immense demand for petroleum minerals and selected agricultural products even as china has assiduously maintained food self sufficiency in staples like rice wheat and pork it cannot be counted as bad that the ranks of the world s economic middle class people who can comfortably enjoy the advantages of modern indoor plumbing heating and air conditioning transport and communication and some discretionary spending on the occasional movie and meal out has grown from the small fraction of the world s people living in western europe and its offshoots in the u s canada and the like to at least double its 1979 numbers thanks to china s economic rise but in 2019 it s clear that there s been a high price to pay the globalization which raced ahead as china and the u s became ever more entangled in an unsustainable economic embrace with china s trade surpluses ballooning and the u s s foreign debts correspondingly growing in large parts thanks to cheap financing of our public debt by china coincided with an era in which u s economic policy was itself lurching further and further away from its mid 20th century equilibrium between business and labor this form of globalization worked splendidly for america s elites including corporations like walmart and apple who were able to profit handsomely from the stream of low cost chinese products and elite universities brimming with the full tuition paying children of china s nouveau riche both mainstream democrats and pre trump republicans were happy enough with the status quo everyone was fine with the fact that china s government s pumping of money into domestic projects to allow its economy to continue growing through the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 prevented the world economy as a whole from experiencing a deeper and more prolonged recession everything has changed since donald trump recognized the potential to harness blue color grievances against china s economic successes and a raft of other issues to turn u s politics on its head the disagreements on trade and other matters between the u s and china have genuine substance but they re being milked by our current administration only for short run political gain and with little chance of actually harnessing the benefits of global trade and economic growth for the benefit of anyone beyond the wealthy beneficiaries of current policies the old jobs aren t coming back forming a new world economic order that benefits the large majority of people in both america and china and ideally in a still broader range of countries is to be aspired to but neither june 4 2019 nor july 4 2019 are likely to see much immediate relief from the current trends on both sides of the pacific

1 the world bank has forecast the global economy to grow 2 6 per cent in 2019 the slowest pace in three years pulled down by slackening world trade and investment economic growth has been slower in most major economies particularly the euro area and some large emerging market and developing economies the world bank expects growth to stabilise soon although its momentum is fragile and subject to substantial risks growth in the emerging and developing world is expected to pick up next year as the turbulence and uncertainty that afflicted a number of countries late last year and this year recedes says the world bank s june 2019 report global economic prospects heightened tensions subdued investment however the bank says much will depend on the momentum of trade disputes between the united states and china growth may be further retarded by an escalation of trade disputes between the world s largest economies renewed financial turmoil in emerging and developing economies or a more abrupt deceleration of economic growth among major economies than is currently envisioned according to the bank of particular concern is a slowdown in global trade growth to the lowest level since the financial crisis ten years ago and a tumble in business confidence stronger economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and improving living standards said world bank group president david malpass current economic momentum remains weak while heightened debt levels and subdued investment growth in developing economies are holding countries back from achieving their potential it is urgent that countries make significant structural reforms that improve the business climate and attract investment they also need to make debt management and transparency a high priority so that new debt adds to growth and investment because equitable growth is essential to alleviating poverty and increasing shared prosperity emerging market and developing economies need to reinforce the protections they have against sudden economic downdrafts the report cautions economic policymakers in emerging and developing economies will need to rein in rising debt levels and carefully select projects for maximum benefit better debt management and greater clarity about loans the bank said subdued investment in emerging market and developing economies raises concern about how these economies can fulfill extensive investment needs to meet development goals the concentration of poverty in low income countries raises questions about overcoming obstacles to faster growth in those economies the risk of renewed financial stress is a reminder of the importance of resilient central banks and monetary policy frameworks that can mitigate the pass through effects of currency depreciations to inflation the world bank produces the gep twice a year in january and june as part of its in depth analysis of key global macroeconomic developments and their impact on member countries the gep provides intelligence in support of achieving development goals and is a trusted resource for member countries stakeholders civil organizations and researchers many emerging and developing economies have borrowed heavily and their hard won reductions of public debt before the global financial crisis have eroded says the bank emerging and developing economy debt has climbed by an average of 15 percentage points to 51 per cent of gdp in 2018 according to the world bank debt accumulation can be justified because of the need for growth enhancing projects such as investments in infrastructure health and education world bank analysis finds that low and middle income countries will need in the range of 640 billion to 2 7 trillion in investment a year to meet development goals by 2030 in addition prudent government spending can help a country ride out an economic downturn but excessive debt carries serious risks even in an environment of low interest rates debt can accumulate to unsustainable levels a government spending large amounts to service debt is allocating less on other important activities high debt also raises the possibility in the minds of investors and consumers that governments may eventually raise taxes to rein in deficits chilling business and consumer spending in extreme cases elevated debt can lead to defaults and bailouts it is urgent that countries make significant structural reforms that improve the business climate and attract investment they also need to make debt management and transparency a high priority so that new debt adds to growth and investment says malpass sluggish global growth and weak investment growth raises concerns about the long term economic prospects of emerging market and developing economies despite a recent modest pickup investment growth is expected to be below long term averages in coming years says the bank this means that the progress emerging and developing economies had made in catching up to advanced economies is slowing slower capital deepening also exerts a drag on the productivity of a country this too stirs worry about filling gaping development needs over the next decade the bank recommends reallocation of resources from unproductive areas and increasing spending efficiency in order to boost public investment improving the ease of doing business for private investment providing greater clarity about the direction of policy and enhancing integration into global value chains as tools to improve growth for commodity exporting economies the bank recommends greater diversification as a means of reducing vulnerability to the volatility of natural resource markets the rapid economic growth in some low income countries since the turn of the century reduced poverty saw many climb to middle income status although many of those countries are still classified as low income based on having a per capita income of 995 or less in 2017 while the number of low income countries has declined since 2001 from 64 to 34 in 2019 the bank says the challenges to the remaining low income countries are steeper than for those that have moved up many of today s low income countries are starting from particularly weak income positions also more than half of today s low income countries are affected by fragility conflict and violence and most of them are geographically disadvantaged by being isolated or landlocked making trade integration tougher also many are heavily reliant on agriculture putting them at greater vulnerability to extreme weather and less able to join global value chains as the prospects for commodity demand soften with slowing growth in major economies and that debt vulnerabilities climbing sharply to achieve stronger growth among low income countries policymakers citizens and the international community look to both external and internal drivers of growth as well as steps to mitigate risk domestically developing stronger financial systems and promoting financial inclusion and strengthening governance and business climates to support the private sector can help as per recent imf data global debt is at 184 trillion the equivalent of 225 per cent of global gdp which means governments have to step up efforts to reduce debt although they are also constrained countries are looking to central banks to respond to the slowing economic growth

buhari and the economist between growth and development by the law of mother nature the strong survives and the weak dies it is the survival of the fittest wherelife is solitary poor nasty brutish and short this was what forced men out of hostile european environment to africa in search of food gold and glory with superior fire power they soon forcefully integrated african society into the world economy by shipping 12 5 million africans to the new world between 1525 and 1886 out of which 10 7m survivedto lay the foundation forwestern europe s prosperity from slavery to globalization it is all about law of nature the strong feeding on blood of the weak the agreement to substitute natural law with international law after 67 years of brutal european wars did not change the narrative international organisations such as world bank world trade organisation and international monetary fund imf formed after the breton wood conference in 1944 to foster global growth and economic stability by working with developing nations toachieve macro economic stability and reduce poverty only consolidated the mindset help comes only after vulnerable help seekers have met the imf conditionalities or what is also known as washington consensus whichinclude austerity measures to further impoverish the people devaluation of currencies trade liberalization or lifting of import and export restrictions and of course privatization or divestiture of all state owned enterprises even with the assault on the economyby president shehu shagari party chairman meredith adisa akinloye and their npn between 1979 1983 our economy was still resilient with our naira as strong as the pound sterling and twice as strong as the us dollar but that all that changed with babangida s ill advised imf inspired structural adjustment programme earlier rejected by muhammadu buhari but vociferously championed by olu falae and kalu idika kalu as demanded by imf our market was opened to manufactured goods from europe and america leading to instant collapse of our budding industries including the vehicle assembly plants electronics and shoe battery tyre and textile industries among many others for instance thekano gaskiya textile factory commissioned in 1985 by muhammadu buhari with staff strength of 4000 was about thelargest in west africa it finally collapsed in 2005 in all over 300 000 jobs were lost in the textile industry alone with no lesson learnt from babangida failed commercialization rip off president olusegun obasanjo between 2003 2007 also embraced the imf inspired privatization programme but despite meeting imf deregulation liberalization and privatization conditionalities the national economic empowerment development strategy needs and the state economic empowerment development strategy seeds its related initiative at state level designed to raise the standard of living of nigerians failed other objectives such as rebuilding decaying infrastructure creation of 7 million new jobs diversification of the economy boosting non energy exports increase industrial capacity utilization and improve agricultural productivity were never achieved but there was growth in 2013 our economy was ranked as the largest economy in africa the 27th largest economy in the world in terms of nominal gdp and the 22nd largest in terms of purchasing power parity nigerian gdp at purchasing power parity ppp was said to have almost tripled from 170 billion in 2000 to 451 billion in 2012 indeed citigroup report published in february 2011 predicted nigeria will have the highest average gdp growth in the world between 2010 and 2050 but it was growth without development the multinationals and their local representatives were the major beneficiaries unlike development growth had no positive impact on quality of education health services infrastructural development communication political participation and overall quality of life of the ordinary nigerians as it was in 1984 buhari in 2015 decided to change the narrative by rejecting the breton wood growth focused economic policies lamido sanusis emir of kano also recently expressed regret for his blind faith in breton woods economic policies as cbn governor which serve only the interest of multinationals and their local representatives for the nation s decayed infrastructures he sought help from china for support and since the nation could not feed herself in spite of the celebrated growth between 1999 and 2015 he deployed huge resources into the agricultural sector to ensure self sufficient in food production related posts experience the ultimate celebration xiaomi fan festival promotion but perhaps because the economist of london only uses growth as index of measurement of prosperity it says nigeria has become the poorest nation on earth in the last four years of buhari predicting more misery for nigerians in the next four years in its may 31 edition it also says with 94m nigerians surviving on less than 1 90 a day a quarter of very poor people in the whole world would be nigerians by 2030 it criticized the federal government s social investment programmes sip and government school feeding programmes for the nation to escape the terrible fate that it believes awaits her the economistpredictably recommends further assault on the poor through the devaluation of the naira and raising the pump price of fuel but since it is often difficult to serve two masters with equal fervor theeconomist cannot be expected to be an unbiased umpire it is therefore not unexpected that it has not taken notice of government efforts at changing the focus from growth to development in any case a news magazine which oncedescribed itself as a product of the caledonian liberalism of adam smith and david hume and has remained an unrepentant promoter of classical and economic liberalism that supports free trade globalisation immigration and cultural liberalism was only being true to itself it was for this reason karl marx the socialist theorist dismissed the london economist as the european organ of the aristocracy of finance which described most strikingly the attitude of this class and the reason the guardian concludes its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three card trick of privatisation deregulation and liberalization others who question the impartiality of the news magazine include john raston saul who says it is a magazine which hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion and edward baptist the author of slavery and american capitalism who attributed the news magazine s harsh review of his work to its adherence to free market fundamentalist theories the idea that everything would be better if measured first and last by its efficiency at producing profit of course questioning the neutrality of the london economist is not to say many nigerians including those who had no choice but to vote for president buhari in the last election are satisfied with his below average performance during his first term that will amount to living in denial many are still angry with the president s handling of herdsmen siege on the middle belt food region of the country the endless reprisal killings in southern kaduna the take over of kaduna abuja road by hoodlums the reign of terror by cattle rustlers banditry and illegal gold miners in zanfara and kidnapping for ransom across the nation unfortunately until the president s last monday reported approval of state and lga policing the cheapest way to tackling insecurity many nigerians believe because of his disregard for public opinion he and those terrorizing nigerians are jointly responsible for holding nigeria hostage

the unexpectedly dovish stance comes as a trade war between the united states and china overshadows the global economy and especially export oriented euro zone countries such as germany the euro and euro zone bond yields rose after draghi s comments while bank shares and inflation expectations fell as investors saw his hints at a rate cut as too timid notably investors took the ecb s new message that rates would remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 as ruling out any cut until then in march the bank had said rates would stay at record lows until at least the end of this year the ecb said it would give banks credit at rates just 10 basis points above its minus 0 4 per cent deposit rate paying them to take its money in other words provided they beat the ecb s lending benchmarks in a new targeted longer term refinancing operation or tltro advertisement with pervasive uncertainty already denting trade big central banks like the ecb and the us federal reserve appear to have given up on plans to tighten policy and markets are now positioned for easing although draghi emphasised that the ecb s policy arsenal is from exhausted analysts point out that its remaining tools lack the potency of earlier measures rates are already at record lows the bank s balance sheet is already bloated and government bonds yields are depressed economists polled by reuters expect rates to stay unchanged and forecast a first rate hike only in 2021 they also expect the bank s next move to entail policy easing rather than tightening with rates already at 0 per cent and no fiscal levers to pull options are somewhat limited turning the qe taps back on by the end of the year is an increasingly probable scenario said nancy curtin chief investment officer at close brothers asset management draghi himself said central banks and the markets have been navigating troubled waters for years and may continue to do so advertisement now we say that monetary policy is non conventional and we are far away from normalisation because the rest of the world the rest of the challenges are far away from being normalised he said it s been like that now for many many many years following first the financial crisis then the sovereign debt crisis then the greek crisis and now we have the threat of rising protectionism the geopolitical dangers that we have seen we have developments in the euro zone itself he also said risks to the economy were tilted to the downside the central bank revised up its growth projection for this year to 1 2 per cent but cut them to 1 4 per cent for both 2020 and 2021 inflation forecasts were also tweaked at philip lane s first policy meeting as ecb chief economist prices are now seen rising 1 3 per cent this year 1 4 per cent next year and 1 6 per cent in 2021 with the ecb officially targeting an inflation rate of just below 2 per cent it still has some way to climb however inflation has undershot this since 2013 and projections suggest it will continue to miss it for years to come advertisement the ecb s problem is the global trade war shows no sign of de escalating italy is once again in conflict with the european commission german industry continues to post dismal figures stock markets are tumbling and a hard brexit is threatened and on top of that inflation expectations the ecb s top worry are steadily declining raising the risk they become dislodged thereby perpetuating weak price growth draghi said he saw no probability of deflation however and a low probability of recession there is no probability of deflation there is very low probability of recession there are no threats of de anchoring of inflation expectations he said the ecb s favoured gauge of market inflation expectations had earlier fallen to its lowest since 2016 while money market pricing showed investors see almost a 70 per cent chance of a 10 basis point cut in ecb rates by the end of the year let s be clear another change to forward guidance is just another step to align the ecb s forward guidance with market expectations not the other way around said carsten brzeski chief economist ing germany reuters

the international monetary fund imf cut its 2019 economic growth forecast for china to 6 2 on wednesday on heightened uncertainty around trade frictions saying more policy easing would be warranted if the sino u s trade war escalates the downgrade came just two months after the imf raised its china forecast to 6 3 from 6 2 partly on then brightening prospects for a trade deal with the united states it also cut the growth forecast for 2020 to 6 from 6 1 a sudden escalation in the trade dispute last month underlined the risks for the world s second biggest economy from higher u s tariffs on billions of dollars of chinese goods washington has levied higher tariffs on a total of 250 billion of chinese imports since mid 2018 accusing china of forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft china which denies the accusations has retaliated with tariffs on about 110 billion of u s goods growth is expected to moderate to 6 2 and 6 0 in 2019 and 2020 respectively imf deputy managing director david lipton said in a statement the near term outlook remains particularly uncertain given the potential for further escalation of trade tensions u s president donald trump has threatened to slap tariffs of up to 25 on an additional list of chinese imports worth about 300 billion the trade war has already upended global supply chains and hurt world growth economists say the tariffs will curb growth in the united states and china and financial markets worry a protracted dispute could tip the world economy into a recession china s central bank has cut the amount of cash that commercial lenders need to set aside as reserves six times since the start of 2018 to spur lending and prop up its slowing economy beijing is also fast tracking infrastructure spending and rolling out tax cuts worth trillions of yuan to support businesses especially manufacturers hurt by the intensifying trade war the policy stimulus announced so far is sufficient to stabilize growth in 2019 20 despite the recent u s tariff hike lipton said following recent meetings with officials in china no additional policy easing is needed provided there are no further increases in tariffs or a significant slowdown in growth in march beijing set a 2019 economic growth target of between 6 and 6 5 growth cooled last year to 6 6 percent the slowest pace in nearly 30 years however risks to the chinese economy would rise sharply if trade conditions sour more quickly let me make it clear if tariffs do go up to say 25 across the board growth would be affected significantly said kenneth kang deputy director of imf asia who led the recent imf visits in this case we do see a case for temporary stimulus to support the economy especially if there is a risk to economic and financial instability he said any chinese stimulus to prop up growth should be contained kang added referring to concerns about rising debt and financial risks further monetary stimulus steps should be taken while focusing on domestic conditions such as inflation risks kang told reporters in beijing the imf expects the headline inflation rate to rise to 2 3 this year from 2 1 percent in 2018 reflecting higher food prices beijing has set a 2019 inflation target of around 3 the imf acknowledged china s past efforts to contain a rapid build up in debt but stressed it was important for beijing to push forward its financial regulatory reforms despite trade tensions the priority should be to fully implement the announced regulatory reforms and continue with structural regulatory reforms to reduce still elevated vulnerabilities lipton said bank capital especially for small and medium size banks should be strengthened and micro prudential regulations should not be relaxed even temporarily for cyclical reasons or to offset tighter domestic financial conditions

fellow shareholders fiscal 2019 was another good year for canaccord genuity group inc we continued to deliver on our objectives of strengthening our existing businesses and expanding into the verticals that we know best as a result our company is demonstrating the resilience and sustainability that we have been working to achieve over the past few years revenue for the full fiscal year was a record 1 2 billion reflecting higher contributions from our global wealth management operations and increased capital raising and advisory activity in our core focus sectors primarily in our north american capital markets business on an adjusted 1 basis canaccord genuity group inc earned pre tax net income of 135 6 million and diluted earnings per share of 0 80 for the fiscal year a year over year improvement of 36 we estimate that roughly half of this amount was contributed by our global wealth management operations and half from our global capital markets business over the past three years we have reshaped our business to derive more predictable contributions from stable businesses and verticals during this period we doubled client assets in our global wealth management businesses and increased contributions from higher margin businesses with an emphasis on increasing our advisory activities in the second half of fiscal 2019 we announced two acquisitions where we saw opportunities to add complementary growth in these areas the addition of thomas miller s private client business in the uk and the isle of man contributes further growth in our client assets and expands our uk business it also enhances our financial planning capabilities as we look to expand our wealth management offering to meet the future planning needs of our growing client base this transaction closed in may 2019 in our capital markets business the acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier adds scale in our u s business and creates an exceptional opportunity to diversify our revenue streams and improve earnings power through market cycles the revenue growth and profitability impact of these developments will be more wholly reflected as we progress through the coming fiscal year with a more stable and diverse global franchise we are focused on enhancing our profit margins and delivering stronger more sustainable returns for our shareholders we remain balanced in our capital allocation by maintaining capital to support the long term growth of our business and returning excess capital to our shareholders during the year we committed capital to grow our wealth management operations and to invest in complementary growth strategies that will make us a stronger capital markets competitor we also repurchased and cancelled a total of 1 379 200 shares and we expect to increase our activity around our share repurchase program into fiscal 2020 in addition i am pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a supplemental dividend of 0 16 bringing our full fiscal year dividend payment to 0 20 an increase of 33 from a year ago our wholly owned wealth management operations have continued to demonstrate stability of revenues and are increasingly contributing a greater share of our profitability excluding significant items our combined wealth management businesses contributed record pre tax net income of 75 4 million for the fiscal year up 31 from a year ago this was achieved on revenue of 461 8 million a year over year increase of 25 we are entrusted with client assets of 65 7 billion globally ___________________________ 1 adjusted earnings is a non ifrs measure generally referred to by the company as net income excluding significant items refer to non ifrs measures in the company s md a with 73 of revenue derived from recurring fee based activities our uk european wealth management business is an important driver of our firmwide stability despite increased development costs in connection with our growth initiatives the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business was 19 for the fiscal year we anticipate greater margin improvement over the coming years as we unlock synergies and expand our financial planning capability to simultaneously deliver greater value for our clients and shareholders in canada our wealth management business delivered another year of impressive growth with revenue of 206 8 million of which 38 was from fee based assets stabilizing market conditions improved transaction activity and meaningful growth in managed assets supported an increase of client assets to 20 6 billion while the average book size per ia team improved by 23 over the year to 135 1 million the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business continued to improve on a year over year basis despite increased costs to support the growth of this segment recruiting momentum has remained strong and we have continued to solidify our position as a leading independent wealth management business in canada as our investment and improved reputation in recent years is making our platform increasingly attractive to established advisors looking ahead we anticipate that australia will contribute a greater share of growth for our wealth management operations our increased investment in our australian operation early in the fiscal year has given us a greater foothold in the region from which we have been actively exploring opportunities to increase contributions from this segment although we have placed a strong focus on adding scale in our wealth management businesses through acquisitions and recruiting a key element of our strategy also involves organic growth through technological innovation product development and the expansion of our client relationships to increase allocations toward advice based services looking forward we will continue to focus on asset and revenue growth with a greater emphasis on margin improvement while we better leverage our scale to generate efficiencies and drive organic growth we are steadily improving our pre tax profit margin as we move toward our goal of 20 for our combined global wealth management businesses by fiscal 2022 a material increase from 16 this year our strategic focus for our global capital markets businesses has centered on establishing mid market leadership in our core focus sectors while making disciplined investments to deepen our client offering and enhance earnings stability through market cycles without question our industry was impacted by significant market headwinds during the fiscal year largely driven by ongoing political uncertainty in the uk a u s federal government shutdown during our second half and a rotation away from small cap equites in australia despite these challenges our global capital markets operations earned annual revenue of to 704 3 million and adjusted pre tax net income of 80 4 million year over year increases of 11 and 29 respectively proficient integration of our sales trading research investment banking and advisory efforts in all regions has helped drive incremental revenue growth and deeper relationships with our clients on a regional basis our u s operation was the most significant contributor of revenue for this segment and we expect that profitability in this business will continue to strengthen as we realize the benefits of the expanded advisory capability that has been driven both organically and through our acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier our canadian business was the strongest contributor to profitability delivering adjusted pre tax net income of 63 0 million reflecting increased activity levels and our active involvement with numerous transactions in the cannabis sector commission and fees revenue in this business also increased each quarter since we completed our acquisition of jitneytrade in the first fiscal quarter market uncertainty in australia led to a difficult period for small cap equities but capital raising activities have recently reaccelerated and the outcome of the recent federal election gives us optimism that this business will recover as activity levels improve and finally despite a strong third quarter in the uk the three month period from january to march 2019 experienced an eight year low for listings on both the lse and aim markets a result of prolonged brexit uncertainty further compounded by fears of a global economic slowdown we took steps to restructure this operation in our fourth quarter and a restructuring charge of 11 8 million has been recorded as a significant item for that period a substantial headcount reduction will be reflected in our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we have also taken steps to rationalize our fixed costs the impact of which will also be seen in the coming fiscal year as an independent investment bank canaccord genuity occupies an increasingly vital role in supporting healthy economies in the regions where we live and work by upholding a disciplined focus in the areas where we know we can add the most value we protect our ability to form lasting partnerships with our clients and provide market leading services at every stage of the business cycle our improved business mix has contributed to both earnings stability and earnings growth we are excited about the opportunities ahead and perhaps more importantly we are advantageously positioned to manage through the inevitable challenges that this dynamic industry and its ever changing operating environment present us we continue to watch our expenses closely and despite higher costs associated with increased activity levels and investments to support growth we have modestly reduced our total expenses as a percentage of revenue on a year over year basis underpinning our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities is a very strong culture while we can t predict changes in the market environment regulatory or political challenges we can ensure that we have a deep bench of talented and committed colleagues working together every day to deliver the very best outcomes for our clients and our shareholders we have continued to advance

and increased contributions from higher margin businesses with an emphasis on increasing our advisory activities in the second half of fiscal 2019 we announced two acquisitions where we saw opportunities to add complementary growth in these areas the addition of thomas miller s private client business in the uk and the isle of man contributes further growth in our client assets and expands our uk business it also enhances our financial planning capabilities as we look to expand our wealth management offering to meet the future planning needs of our growing client base this transaction closed in may 2019 in our capital markets business the acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier adds scale in our u s business and creates an exceptional opportunity to diversify our revenue streams and improve earnings power through market cycles the revenue growth and profitability impact of these developments will be more wholly reflected as we progress through the coming fiscal year with a more stable and diverse global franchise we are focused on enhancing our profit margins and delivering stronger more sustainable returns for our shareholders we remain balanced in our capital allocation by maintaining capital to support the long term growth of our business and returning excess capital to our shareholders during the year we committed capital to grow our wealth management operations and to invest in complementary growth strategies that will make us a stronger capital markets competitor we also repurchased and cancelled a total of 1 379 200 shares and we expect to increase our activity around our share repurchase program into fiscal 2020 in addition i am pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a supplemental dividend of 0 16 bringing our full fiscal year dividend payment to 0 20 an increase of 33 from a year ago our wholly owned wealth management operations have continued to demonstrate stability of revenues and are increasingly contributing a greater share of our profitability excluding significant items our combined wealth management businesses contributed record pre tax net income of 75 4 million for the fiscal year up 31 from a year ago this was achieved on revenue of 461 8 million a year over year increase of 25 we are entrusted with client assets of 65 7 billion globally ___________________________ 1 adjusted earnings is a non ifrs measure generally referred to by the company as net income excluding significant items refer to non ifrs measures in the company s md a with 73 of revenue derived from recurring fee based activities our uk european wealth management business is an important driver of our firmwide stability despite increased development costs in connection with our growth initiatives the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business was 19 for the fiscal year we anticipate greater margin improvement over the coming years as we unlock synergies and expand our financial planning capability to simultaneously deliver greater value for our clients and shareholders in canada our wealth management business delivered another year of impressive growth with revenue of 206 8 million of which 38 was from fee based assets stabilizing market conditions improved transaction activity and meaningful growth in managed assets supported an increase of client assets to 20 6 billion while the average book size per ia team improved by 23 over the year to 135 1 million the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business continued to improve on a year over year basis despite increased costs to support the growth of this segment recruiting momentum has remained strong and we have continued to solidify our position as a leading independent wealth management business in canada as our investment and improved reputation in recent years is making our platform increasingly attractive to established advisors looking ahead we anticipate that australia will contribute a greater share of growth for our wealth management operations our increased investment in our australian operation early in the fiscal year has given us a greater foothold in the region from which we have been actively exploring opportunities to increase contributions from this segment although we have placed a strong focus on adding scale in our wealth management businesses through acquisitions and recruiting a key element of our strategy also involves organic growth through technological innovation product development and the expansion of our client relationships to increase allocations toward advice based services looking forward we will continue to focus on asset and revenue growth with a greater emphasis on margin improvement while we better leverage our scale to generate efficiencies and drive organic growth we are steadily improving our pre tax profit margin as we move toward our goal of 20 for our combined global wealth management businesses by fiscal 2022 a material increase from 16 this year our strategic focus for our global capital markets businesses has centered on establishing mid market leadership in our core focus sectors while making disciplined investments to deepen our client offering and enhance earnings stability through market cycles without question our industry was impacted by significant market headwinds during the fiscal year largely driven by ongoing political uncertainty in the uk a u s federal government shutdown during our second half and a rotation away from small cap equites in australia despite these challenges our global capital markets operations earned annual revenue of to 704 3 million and adjusted pre tax net income of 80 4 million year over year increases of 11 and 29 respectively proficient integration of our sales trading research investment banking and advisory efforts in all regions has helped drive incremental revenue growth and deeper relationships with our clients on a regional basis our u s operation was the most significant contributor of revenue for this segment and we expect that profitability in this business will continue to strengthen as we realize the benefits of the expanded advisory capability that has been driven both organically and through our acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier our canadian business was the strongest contributor to profitability delivering adjusted pre tax net income of 63 0 million reflecting increased activity levels and our active involvement with numerous transactions in the cannabis sector commission and fees revenue in this business also increased each quarter since we completed our acquisition of jitneytrade in the first fiscal quarter market uncertainty in australia led to a difficult period for small cap equities but capital raising activities have recently reaccelerated and the outcome of the recent federal election gives us optimism that this business will recover as activity levels improve and finally despite a strong third quarter in the uk the three month period from january to march 2019 experienced an eight year low for listings on both the lse and aim markets a result of prolonged brexit uncertainty further compounded by fears of a global economic slowdown we took steps to restructure this operation in our fourth quarter and a restructuring charge of 11 8 million has been recorded as a significant item for that period a substantial headcount reduction will be reflected in our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we have also taken steps to rationalize our fixed costs the impact of which will also be seen in the coming fiscal year as an independent investment bank canaccord genuity occupies an increasingly vital role in supporting healthy economies in the regions

more importantly we are advantageously positioned to manage through the inevitable challenges that this dynamic industry and its ever changing operating environment present us we continue to watch our

north american capital markets business on an adjusted 1 basis canaccord genuity group inc earned pre tax net income of 135 6 million and diluted earnings per share of 0 80 for the fiscal year a year over year improvement of 36 we estimate that roughly half of this amount was contributed by our global wealth management operations and half from our global capital markets business over the past three years we have reshaped our business to derive more predictable contributions from stable businesses and verticals during this period we doubled client assets in our global wealth management businesses and increased contributions from higher margin businesses with an emphasis on increasing our advisory activities in the second half of fiscal 2019 we announced two acquisitions where we saw opportunities to add complementary growth in these areas the addition of thomas miller s private client business in the uk and the isle of man contributes further growth in our client assets and expands our uk business it also enhances our financial planning capabilities as we look to expand our wealth management offering to meet the future planning needs of our growing client base this transaction closed in may 2019 in our capital markets business the acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier adds scale in our u s business and creates an exceptional opportunity to diversify our revenue streams and improve earnings power through market cycles the revenue growth and profitability impact of these developments will be more wholly reflected as we progress through the coming fiscal year with a more stable and diverse global franchise we are focused on enhancing our profit margins and delivering stronger more sustainable returns for our shareholders we remain balanced in our capital allocation by maintaining capital to support the long term growth of our business and returning excess capital to our shareholders during the year we committed capital to grow our wealth management operations and to invest in complementary growth strategies that will make us a stronger capital markets competitor we also repurchased and cancelled a total of 1 379 200 shares and we expect to increase our activity around our share repurchase program into fiscal 2020 in addition i am pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a supplemental dividend of 0 16 bringing our full fiscal year dividend payment to 0 20 an increase of 33 from a year ago our wholly owned wealth management operations have continued to demonstrate stability of revenues and are increasingly contributing a greater share of our profitability excluding significant items our combined wealth management businesses contributed record pre tax net income of 75 4 million for the fiscal year up 31 from a year ago this was achieved on revenue of 461 8 million a year over year increase of 25 we are entrusted with client assets of 65 7 billion globally ___________________________ 1 adjusted earnings is a non ifrs measure generally referred to by the company as net income excluding significant items refer to non ifrs measures in the company s md a with 73 of revenue derived from recurring fee based activities our uk european wealth management business is an important driver of our firmwide stability despite increased development costs in connection with our growth initiatives the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business was 19 for the fiscal year we anticipate greater margin improvement over the coming years as we unlock synergies and expand our financial planning capability to simultaneously deliver greater value for our clients and shareholders in canada our wealth management business delivered another year of impressive growth with revenue of 206 8 million of which 38 was from fee based assets stabilizing market conditions improved transaction activity and meaningful growth in managed assets supported an increase of client assets to 20 6 billion while the average book size per ia team improved by 23 over the year to 135 1 million the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business continued to improve on a year over year basis despite increased costs to support the growth of this segment recruiting momentum has remained strong and we have continued to solidify our position as a leading independent wealth management business in canada as our investment and improved reputation in recent years is making our platform increasingly attractive to established advisors looking ahead we anticipate that australia will contribute a greater share of growth for our wealth management operations our increased investment in our australian operation early in the fiscal year has given us a greater foothold in the region from which we have been actively exploring opportunities to increase contributions from this segment although we have placed a strong focus on adding scale in our wealth management businesses through acquisitions and recruiting a key element of our strategy also involves organic growth through technological innovation product development and the expansion of our client relationships to increase allocations toward advice based services looking forward we will continue to focus on asset and revenue growth with a greater emphasis on margin improvement while we better leverage our scale to generate efficiencies and drive organic growth we are steadily improving our pre tax profit margin as we move toward our goal of 20 for our combined global wealth management businesses by fiscal 2022 a material increase from 16 this year our strategic focus for our global capital markets businesses has centered on establishing mid market leadership in our core focus sectors while making disciplined investments to deepen our client offering and enhance earnings stability through market cycles without question our industry was impacted by significant market headwinds during the fiscal year largely driven by ongoing political uncertainty in the uk a u s federal government shutdown during our second half and a rotation away from small cap equites in australia despite these challenges our global capital markets operations earned annual revenue of to 704 3 million and adjusted pre tax net income of 80 4 million year over year increases of 11 and 29 respectively proficient integration of our sales trading research investment banking and advisory efforts in all regions has helped drive incremental revenue growth and deeper relationships with our clients on a regional basis our u s operation was the most significant contributor of revenue for this segment and we expect that profitability in this business will continue to strengthen as we realize the benefits of the expanded advisory capability that has been driven both organically and through our acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier our canadian business was the strongest contributor to profitability delivering adjusted pre tax net income of 63 0 million reflecting increased activity levels and our active involvement with numerous transactions in the cannabis sector commission and fees revenue in this business also increased each quarter since we completed our acquisition of jitneytrade in the first fiscal quarter market uncertainty in australia led to a difficult period for small cap equities but capital raising activities have recently reaccelerated and the outcome of the recent federal election gives us optimism that this business will recover as activity levels improve and finally despite a strong third quarter in the uk the three month period from january to march 2019 experienced an eight year low for listings on both the lse and aim markets a result of prolonged brexit uncertainty further compounded by fears of a global economic slowdown we took steps to restructure this operation in our fourth quarter and a restructuring charge of 11 8 million has been recorded as a significant item for that period a substantial headcount reduction will be reflected in our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we have also taken steps to rationalize our fixed costs the impact of which will also be seen in the coming fiscal year as an independent investment bank canaccord genuity occupies an increasingly vital role in supporting healthy economies in the regions

leading services at every stage of the business cycle our improved business mix has contributed to both earnings stability and earnings growth we are excited about the opportunities ahead and perhaps more importantly we are advantageously positioned to manage through the inevitable challenges that this dynamic industry and its ever changing operating environment present us we continue to watch our expenses closely and despite higher costs associated with increased activity levels and investments to support growth we have modestly reduced our total expenses as a percentage of revenue on a year over year basis underpinning our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities is a very strong culture while we can t predict changes in the market environment regulatory or political challenges we

adjustment facility laf to 5 75 percent from 6 0 percent with immediate effect consequently the reverse repo rate under the laf stands adjusted to 5 50 percent and the marginal standing facility msf rate and the bank rate to 6 0 percent the reserve bank said in its statement story continues below advertisement remove ad all six members of the monetary policy committee mpc voted for a cut in repo rate the rate at which rbi lends to banks other key points from the policy statement are h2fy20 cpi inflation estimate revised down to 3 4 3 7 percent from 3 5 3 8 percent though h1fy20 inflation estimate increased to 3 3 1 percent from 2 9 3 percent fy20 gdp growth forecast cut to 7 percent from 7 2 percent rbi said a sharp slowdown in investment activity along with a continuing moderation in private consumption growth is a matter of concern the headline inflation trajectory remains below the target mandated to the mpc even after taking into account the expected transmission of the past two policy rate cuts it said hence there is scope for the mpc to accommodate growth concerns by supporting efforts to boost aggregate demand and in particular reinvigorate private investment activity while remaining consistent with its flexible inflation targeting mandate it said the central bank has not mentioned any special package for nbfcs barring the appointment of the working group to look at liquidity problem we have collated experts views on the monetary policy committee s interest rate decision story continues below advertisement remove ad lakshmi iyer chief investment officer debt head products kotak mahindra asset management company the cut in repos rate was broadly in line with expectations the shift in gear from neutral to accommodative removes ambiguity wrt the direction of rate action the growth focus without losing sight of inflation seems to have prompted this move liquidity in the banking system has seen a movement from deficit to positive zone it is important to see this situation continues to ensure credit transmission india rates would continue to find anchor and maintain a softening bias going forward jagannadham thunuguntla senior vp and head of research wealth centrum broking with rbi s 25 bps cut the repo rate in india has reached to 9 year low level of 5 75 percent even though rbi had changed the stance to accommodative the leg room for further rate cuts is limited further the repayment delay by dhfl with outstanding loan of rs 1 1 lac crores is way too big a strain for the market considering il fs default to the tune of rs 90 000 crore itself remained unaddressed after 10 months of default further ongoing trump s tweets for further tariffs on china has added fuel to already unsettled global geo political sentiment all in all the markets have turned risk averse with the worries associated with contagion risk in this backdrop new finance minister s first budget in first week of july holds key to change the narrative from defaults to durable growth gaurav dua sr vp head strategy investments sharekhan by bnp paribas rate cut and moderation in gdp growth forecast is in line with expectations clearly the chance in stance and the commentary indicates that the rate cut would continue in the next two or more forthcoming policy review meet this year rbi has also indicated some measures to ease liquidity with stance of maintaining a surplus on laf window rather than deficit a working group of liquidity will also be formed to ensure transmission of rate cuts to borrowers bond yields have already rallied on expectations and could again soften further after a temporary hardening led by profit booking by some banks we continue to retain positive view on banking sector amar ambani president research head yes securities in a fairly dovish policy the rbi as we anticipated not only reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points but also changed its policy stance to accommodative from neutral more importantly the rbi has addressed the liquidity crisis in the system with open market operations turning laf into surplus in early days of june 2019 it has assured of liquidity support as and when needed we have factored in another 25 basis point repo cut in the year 2019 itself umesh mehta head of research samco securities this is the third consecutive time that rbi has cut rates by 25bps which shows that they are indeed taking care of the slowing growth and as expected are being supportive by loosening their purse indian economy has been experiencing a slowdown with unemployment at 45 year highs cpi inflation excluding food and fuel down to 4 5 percent in april from 5 1 percent in march and a revision by the rbi on the gdp for fy20 from 7 2 percent to 7 percent indicates just that this is positive for the street however as the rate cut was inline with expectations which had already been factored in the indices did not cheer the rate cut and continued to trickle down if the international trade tensions continue to escalate further the fed might cut rates which will further create room for rbi to reduce rates in future garima kapoor economist elara capital drawing comfort from consistent softness in inflation trajectory mpc cut the repo rate for a third time this year to support benign growth conditions a shift in the stance to accommodative is welcome as it will pave way for transmission to lending rates which so far have been inadequate we expect mpc to cut rates by an additional 50 bps through the year while continuing to finetune liquidity support through a combination of omo purchases forex swap and crr cut suvodeep rakshit sr economist kotak institutional equities rbi reduced repo rate by 25 bps as expected the change in stance to accommodative was a bit of a surprise debt markets will take this as a significant positive move though most of the rate cut cycle is probably over the tone of the rbi policy was dovish and highlights the concerns on growth we maintain our call for another 25 bps rate cut in august factoring in the benign inflation trajectory and the growing concerns on growth however the transmission of the rate cuts will be key and the rbi should aim to maintain the liquidity at least at neutral over the next few months naveen kulkarni head of research reliance securities while the rate cut of 25 basis points was in line with our expectation concerns over growth and challenges regarding liquidity continue to linger the market is not necessarily cheering the rate cut as it had already factored in and something more was expected joseph thomas head research emkay wealth management the rbi policy announcement is exactly on the same lines as expected by most of the market participants the repo rate cut of 0 25 percent and the change of stance from neutral to accommodative is key to supporting the sagging economic growth the projected growth has been lowered to 7 percent the policy also has broad indications of more action on the liquidity front from the rbi in the coming days this also confirms the commitment of the central bank to better transmission of the rate cut effects through liquidity vk vijayakumar chief investment strategist geojit financial services the mpc should be appreciated for coming up with the right policy at the right time the 25 bp cut in policy rates along with the change in stance to accommodative from neutral is eminently desirable the scaling down of the gdp growth rate to 7 percent and inflation target to 3 4 to 3 7 percent for fy20 will ensure that the policy will remain accommodative for some time the 10 year bond yield is likely to remain at sub 7 levels for an extended period of time the governor s assurance that adequate liquidity will be provided will ensure that the present surplus liquidity situation will sustain amit gupta co founder and ceo tradingbells rbi has announced a rate cut of 25 basis points fueled by a stable government sharp decline in crude oil prices and a slowdown in the economy rbi changed its stance to accommodative and a possibility of further rate cuts this year remains open we can expect a further rate cut of 50 to 75 basis points in 2019 real estate nbfc banking and auto sectors would be the key beneficiaries of this rate cut where a temporary uptick can be seen in many stocks but quality stocks will continue to outperform sujan hajra chief economist and executive director anand rathi shares stock brokers low inflation and subdued growth are the drivers of the move yet the real concern is the lack of transmission of rate cuts into the effective lending rate liquidity conditions also remain tight for a large part of the corporate sector shishir baijal chairman managing director knight frank india the rate cut is certainly a welcome step especially for the real estate sector the benefit of a lower policy rate in terms of better credit cost as well as higher liquidity will hopefully be transmitted further by banks to nbfcs as well as home buyers also the change in policy stance from neutral to accommodative is a welcome shift as it lays ground for further rate cuts the cash crunched nbfcs will definitely benefit from the inflow of capital which will in turn benefit developers as well as home buyers nbfcs have been facing a liquidity crisis and this has negatively impacted their loans to real estate including construction finance besides capital infusion into this important financier segment this rate cut will also improve the home buyers affordability and stimulate housing demand at this critical juncture ananth narayan professor at spjimr to cnbc tv18 the change in stance to accommodative suggests the mpc is going in the right direction and i hope the real reforms on fiscal nbfc and liquidity front coming six points repo rate cut by 25 bps change in the stance 6 0 vote for rate cut reduction in inflation forecast cut in growth forecast and reasons for change in policy stance indicate bullish

improve liquidity kamal k mahajan bank of baroda to cnbc tv18 this policy will help build confidence for banks we expect certain liquidity measures in the near term the transmission of repo rate cut will take place in the next one or two months upasna bhardwaj senior economist kotak mahindra bank to cnbc tv18 it is a fairly dovish policy and broadly in line with expectations in fact the entire package including revised down growth forecast 6 0 vote to repo rate cut etc is very dovish and is a pleasant surprise rbi and mpc are trying to provide proper communication which has brought clarity

would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami loading a lot of people who

median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in

the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher

than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets

the verticals that we know best as a result our company is demonstrating the resilience and sustainability that we have been working to achieve over the past few years revenue for the full fiscal year was a record 1 2 billion reflecting higher contributions from our global wealth management operations and increased capital raising and advisory activity in our core focus sectors primarily in our north american capital markets business on an adjusted 1 basis canaccord genuity group inc earned pre tax net income of 135 6 million and diluted earnings per share of 0 80 for the fiscal year a year over year improvement of 36 we estimate that roughly half of this amount was contributed by our global wealth management operations and half from our global capital markets business over the past three years we have reshaped our business to derive more predictable contributions from stable businesses and verticals during this period we doubled client assets in our global wealth management businesses and increased contributions from higher margin businesses with an emphasis on increasing our advisory activities in the second half of fiscal 2019 we announced two acquisitions where we saw opportunities to add complementary growth in these areas the addition of thomas miller s private client business in the uk and the isle of man contributes further growth in our client assets and expands our uk business it also enhances our financial planning capabilities as we look to expand our wealth management offering to meet the future planning needs of our growing client base this transaction closed in may 2019 in our capital markets business the acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier adds scale in our u s business and creates an exceptional opportunity to diversify our revenue streams and improve earnings power through market cycles the revenue growth and profitability impact of these developments will be more wholly reflected as we progress through the coming fiscal year with a more stable and diverse global franchise we are focused on enhancing our profit margins and delivering stronger more sustainable returns for our shareholders we remain balanced in our capital allocation by maintaining capital to support the long term growth of our business and returning excess capital to our shareholders during the year we committed capital to grow our wealth management operations and to invest in complementary growth strategies that will make us a stronger capital markets competitor we also repurchased and cancelled a total of 1 379 200 shares and we expect to increase our activity around our share repurchase program into fiscal 2020 in addition i am pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a supplemental dividend of 0 16 bringing our full fiscal year dividend payment to 0 20 an increase of 33 from a year ago our wholly owned wealth management operations have continued to demonstrate stability of revenues and are increasingly contributing a greater share of our profitability excluding significant items our combined wealth management businesses contributed record pre tax net income of 75 4 million for the fiscal year up 31 from a year ago this was achieved on revenue of 461 8 million a year over year increase of 25 we are entrusted with client assets of 65 7 billion globally ___________________________ 1 adjusted earnings is a non ifrs measure generally referred to by the company as net income excluding significant items refer to non ifrs measures in the company s md a with 73 of revenue derived from recurring fee based activities our uk european wealth management business is an important driver of our firmwide stability despite increased development costs in connection with our growth initiatives the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business was 19 for the fiscal year we anticipate greater margin improvement over the coming years as we unlock synergies and expand our financial planning capability to simultaneously deliver greater value for our clients and shareholders in canada our wealth management business delivered another year of impressive growth with revenue of 206 8 million of which 38 was from fee based assets stabilizing market conditions improved transaction activity and meaningful growth in managed assets supported an increase of client assets to 20 6 billion while the average book size per ia team improved by 23 over the year to 135 1 million the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business continued to improve on a year over year basis despite increased costs to support the growth of this segment recruiting momentum has remained strong and we have continued to solidify our position as a leading independent wealth management business in canada as our investment and improved reputation in recent years is making our platform increasingly attractive to established advisors looking ahead we anticipate that australia will contribute a greater share of growth for our wealth management operations our increased investment in our australian operation early in the fiscal year has given us a greater foothold in the region from which we have been actively exploring opportunities to increase contributions from this segment although we have placed a strong focus on adding scale in our wealth management businesses through acquisitions and recruiting a key element of our strategy also involves organic growth through technological innovation product development and the expansion of our client relationships to increase allocations toward advice based services looking forward we will continue to focus on asset and revenue growth with a greater emphasis on margin improvement while we better leverage our scale to generate efficiencies and drive organic growth we are steadily improving our pre tax profit margin as we move toward our goal of 20 for our combined global wealth management businesses by fiscal 2022 a material increase from 16 this year our strategic focus for our global capital markets businesses has centered on establishing mid market leadership in our core focus sectors while making disciplined investments to deepen our client offering and enhance earnings stability through market cycles without question our industry was impacted by significant market headwinds during the fiscal year largely driven by ongoing political uncertainty in the uk a u s federal government shutdown during our second half and a rotation away from small cap equites in australia despite these challenges our global capital markets operations earned annual revenue of to 704 3 million and adjusted pre tax net income of 80 4 million year over year increases of 11 and 29 respectively proficient integration of our sales trading research investment banking and advisory efforts in all regions has helped drive incremental revenue growth and deeper relationships with our clients on a regional basis our u s operation was the most significant contributor of revenue for this segment and we expect that profitability in this business will continue to strengthen as we realize the benefits of the expanded advisory capability that has been driven both organically and through our acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier our canadian business was the strongest contributor to profitability delivering adjusted pre tax net income of 63 0 million reflecting increased activity levels and our active involvement with numerous transactions in the cannabis sector commission and fees revenue in this business also increased each quarter since we completed our acquisition of jitneytrade in the first fiscal quarter market uncertainty in australia led to a difficult period for small cap equities but capital raising activities have recently reaccelerated and the outcome of the recent federal election gives us optimism that this business will recover as activity levels improve and finally despite a strong third quarter in the uk the three month period from january to march 2019 experienced an eight year low for listings on both the lse and aim markets a result of prolonged brexit uncertainty further compounded by fears of a global economic slowdown we took steps to restructure this operation in our fourth quarter and a restructuring charge of 11 8 million has been recorded as a significant item for that period a substantial headcount reduction will be reflected in our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we have also taken steps to rationalize our fixed costs the impact of which will also be seen in the coming fiscal year as an independent investment bank canaccord genuity occupies an increasingly vital role in supporting healthy economies in the regions where we live and work by upholding a disciplined focus in the areas where we know we can add the most value we protect our ability to form lasting partnerships with our clients and provide market leading services at every stage of the business cycle our improved business mix has contributed to both earnings stability and earnings growth we are excited about the opportunities ahead and perhaps more importantly we are advantageously positioned to manage through the inevitable challenges that this dynamic industry and its ever changing operating environment present us we continue to watch our expenses closely and despite higher costs associated with increased activity levels and investments to support growth we have modestly reduced our total expenses as a percentage of revenue on a year over year basis underpinning our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities is a very strong culture while we can t predict changes in the market environment regulatory or political challenges we

by reuters by balazs koranyi and francesco canepa vilnius reuters the european central bank pushed back the timing of its first post crisis interest rate hike again on thursday and said it would continue paying banks for lending in its latest effort to revive a slowing euro zone economy the moves which are bolder than analysts had expected until only a few weeks ago come as a trade war between the united states and china overshadows the global economy and especially export oriented euro zone countries such as germany responding to rapidly deteriorating inflation expectations the ecb pledged to keep its interest rates at their current record low level at least through the first half of 2020 instead of the end of this year as it had said only in march it will also let banks borrow from the ecb at rate just 10 basis points above its minus 0 4 deposit rate provided they beat the ecb s lending benchmarks in a new targeted longer term refinancing operation or tltro for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark the rate applied in tltro iii will be lower and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points the ecb said in a statement with pervasive uncertainty already denting trade big central banks like the ecb and the u s federal reserve appear to have given up on plans to tighten policy and markets are now positioned for easing attention will now shift to ecb president mario draghi s news conference at 1230 gmt draghi is certain to maintain a dovish tone and leave open the possibility of more stimulus but the italian whose term ends on oct 31 cannot afford bigger moves for now as the ecb s policy arsenal is nearly depleted after years of stimulus while policymakers say they have plenty of tools left they have already pushed their main interest rate below zero and bought some 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds meaning the scope for more stimulus has shrunk especially in the case of imported economic weakness economists polled by reuters expect rates to stay unchanged and expect a first rate hike only in 2021 they also expect the bank s next move to entail policy easing rather than tightening risks draghi s problem is that the global trade war shows no sign of de escalating while italy is once again in conflict with the european commission german industry continues to post dismal figures stock markets are tumbling and the threat of a hard brexit looms and on top of it all inflation expectations the ecb s top worry are steadily declining raising the risk that they become dislodged thereby perpetuating weak price growth philip lane s first policy meeting as ecb chief economist is likely to see the bank s staff cut some of their inflation projections reinforcing already widespread concerns that price growth is too weak the ecb targets an inflation rate of just below 2 but it has undershot this since 2013 and projections suggest it will continue to miss it for years to come advertisement the ecb s favoured gauge of market inflation expectations fell to its lowest since 2016 earlier on thursday while money market pricing showed investors see almost a 70 chance of a 10 basis point cut in ecb rates by the end of the year draghi is also expected to stick to his message that the economy s rebound is merely delayed and not derailed but with record high employment solid wage rises and several years of unexpectedly good economic growth having failed to boost prices some may be losing confidence easy monetary policy will be needed for a long time and the risks remain clearly tilted to the downside nordea economist jan von gerich said prior to the rate decision advertisement reporting by balazs koranyi and francesco canepa editing by catherine evans

over year improvement of 36 we estimate that roughly half of this amount was contributed by our global wealth management operations and half from our global capital markets business over the past three years we have reshaped our business to derive more predictable contributions from stable businesses and verticals during this period we doubled client assets in our global wealth management businesses and increased contributions from higher margin businesses with an emphasis on increasing our advisory activities in the second half of fiscal 2019 we announced two acquisitions where we saw opportunities to add complementary growth in these areas the addition of thomas miller s private client business in the uk and the isle of man contributes further growth in our client assets and expands our uk business it also enhances our financial planning capabilities as we look to expand our wealth management offering to meet the future planning needs of our growing client base this transaction closed in may 2019 in our capital markets business the acquisition of mid market advisory firm petsky prunier adds scale in our u s business and creates an exceptional opportunity to diversify our revenue streams and improve earnings power through market cycles the revenue growth and profitability impact of these developments will be more wholly reflected as we progress through the coming fiscal year with a more stable and diverse global franchise we are focused on enhancing our profit margins and delivering stronger more sustainable returns for our shareholders we remain balanced in our capital allocation by maintaining capital to support the long term growth of our business and returning excess capital to our shareholders during the year we committed capital to grow

1 adjusted earnings is a non ifrs measure generally referred to by the company as net income excluding significant items refer to non ifrs measures in the company s md a with 73 of revenue derived from recurring fee based activities our uk european wealth management business is an important driver of our firmwide stability despite increased development costs in connection with our growth initiatives the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business was 19 for the fiscal year we anticipate greater margin improvement over the coming years as we unlock synergies and expand our financial planning capability to simultaneously deliver greater value for our clients and shareholders in canada our wealth management business delivered another year of impressive growth with revenue of 206 8 million of which 38 was from fee based assets stabilizing market conditions improved transaction activity and meaningful growth in managed assets supported an increase of client assets to 20 6 billion while the average book size per ia team improved by 23 over the year to 135 1 million the adjusted pre tax profit margin in this business continued to improve on a year over year basis despite increased costs to support the growth of this segment recruiting momentum has remained strong and we have continued to solidify our position as a leading independent wealth management business in canada as our investment and improved reputation in recent years is making our platform increasingly attractive to established advisors looking ahead we anticipate that australia will contribute a greater share of growth for our wealth management operations our increased investment in our australian operation early in the fiscal year has given us a greater foothold in the region from which we have been actively exploring opportunities to increase contributions from this segment although we have placed a strong focus on adding scale in our wealth management businesses through acquisitions and recruiting a key element of our strategy also involves organic growth through technological innovation product development and the expansion of our client relationships to increase allocations toward advice based services looking forward we will continue to focus on asset and revenue growth with a greater emphasis on margin improvement while we better leverage our scale to generate efficiencies and drive organic growth we are steadily improving our pre tax profit margin as we move toward our goal of 20 for our combined global wealth management businesses by fiscal 2022 a material increase from 16 this year our strategic focus for our global capital markets businesses has centered on establishing mid market leadership in our core focus sectors while making disciplined investments to deepen our client offering and enhance earnings stability through market cycles without question our industry was impacted by significant market headwinds during the fiscal year largely driven by ongoing political uncertainty in the uk a u s federal government shutdown during our second half and a rotation away from small cap equites in australia despite these challenges our global capital markets operations earned annual revenue of to 704 3 million and adjusted pre tax net income of 80 4 million year over year increases of 11 and 29 respectively proficient integration of our sales trading research investment banking and advisory efforts in all regions has helped drive incremental revenue growth and deeper relationships with our clients on a regional basis our u s operation was the most significant contributor of revenue for this segment and we expect that profitability in this business will continue to strengthen as we realize the benefits of the expanded

there is a dirty little secret in economics today the united states has benefited and continues to benefit from the global slump the us economy is humming along even while protesters in the united kingdom hurl milkshakes at brexiteers french president emmanuel macron confronts nihilist yellow vested marchers and chinese tech firms such as huawei fear being frozen out of foreign markets last year the us economy grew by 2 9 while the eurozone expanded by just 1 8 giving president donald trump even more confidence in his confrontational style but relatively strong us growth amid sluggishness elsewhere is not what economics textbooks would predict whatever happened to the tightly integrated world economy that the international monetary fund and the world bank have been advocating and more recently extolling since world war ii the us economy is in a temporary but potent phase in which weakness abroad lifts spirits at home but this economic euphoria has nothing to do with trump era spite and malice and much to do with interest rates borrowing costs are currently lower than at any time since the founding of the us federal reserve in 1913 or in the uk s case since the bank of england was established in 1694 the ten year us treasury bond is yielding about 2 123 and in april the streaming service netflix issued junk bonds at a rate of just 5 4 if a rip van winkle economist were to wake up today after a decades long sleep and see only those numbers he or she would assume that one fifth of americans were unemployed and standing in lines outside soup kitchens instead the us jobless rate is at its lowest level since neil armstrong took his famous first step onto the moon s surface 50 years ago the idea that the us wins in a global slump might sound like the sardonic musing of some unreconstructed marxist in the dingy corner of a faculty lounge but such a view is not ideological rather global interest rates are scraping the floor because gdp growth outside the us is so sluggish persistently low interest rates and weak inflation bring multiple benefits to the us economy for starters american consumers whose real inflation adjusted wages are finally increasing after decades of stagnation are seeing all sorts of bargains when i visited an apple store a few days ago an employee at the repair counter told me that i could finance a new iphone at 0 interest car dealers are offering zero interest financing too moreover the us stock market has soared because yields on bank certificates of deposit cds look so puny when i was a kid in the 1970s my mother placed our family savings in a bank and received not only a 6 return but also a blender today a six month bank cd might pay only one third of a percentage point and my mother can no longer expect a blender or even a lollipop from the bank in return for parking her money there finally low interest rates mean that us businesses can obtain nearly free financing when they purchase equipment as a result of low borrowing costs and new tax write offs the us economy added 215 000 new machine manufacturing jobs in 2018 and foreign investors realise that new equipment will make us companies more competitive but surely the textbooks insist a hobbled global economy will squeeze us exports that is true especially when combined with china s new tariffs on american goods and a strong dollar which makes us exports more expensive internationally still exports make up only 12 of the us economy and nearly one third of them go to canada and mexico whose economies have been doing okay moreover many of the most valuable us exports are must have items or oligopolistic goods made by only a few companies such as boeing jets qualcomm chips or apple iphones it is hard even for dejected frenchmen or angst ridden germans to do without these the buoyancy of the us economy worries policymakers in other countries they would prefer if the us stumbled along beside them and was forced to concoct cooperative ways of boosting global growth instead trump needles rather than wheedles for trade deals and happily pockets the benefits to the us economy that result from doldrums abroad no one knows when trump s trade needling will stop of course but as long as inflation remains a distant specter america s economy will continue to enjoy this unusual type of growth todd g buchholz has served as director of economic policy under president george h w bush and as managing director of the tiger hedge fund he was awarded harvard university s allyn young teaching prize in economics and is the author of new ideas from dead economists and the price of prosperity copyright 2019 project syndicate here with permission

source xinhua 2019 06 07 05 26 10 editor yan video player close washington june 6 xinhua the u s public debt is on an unsustainable path and policy adjustments are needed to lower the fiscal deficit and to put public debt on a gradual downward path over the medium term the international monetary fund imf said thursday the u s administration s fiscal expansion has supported economic activity but this has come at the cost of continued increase in the debt to gdp ratio the imf said in a concluding statement that describes the preliminary findings of its annual article iv consultation to review the u s economy laying out a few policy options based on the budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 that president donald trump sent to congress in march the deficit is expected to reach about 1 trillion u s dollars for fiscal year 2020 the congressional budget office cbo estimated in may federal debt held by the public would equal 87 percent of gdp in 2029 under the president s budget compared with 78 percent in 2019 the cbo said any successful package will likely require steps to address the expected increases in entitlement spending on health and social security to raise indirect taxes and to institute a federal carbon tax imf managing director christine lagarde said at a press conference thursday in the statement the imf projected the u s economy to grow at the rate of 2 6 percent this year before moderating to 1 9 percent in 2020 the estimation only considered the tariffs that have been put in place and didn t factor in the u s administration s proposed tariffs on its trading partners noting that there are a lot of positives in the macroeconomic outcomes lagarde said the imf is concerned that the benefits from this decade long expansion have in general not been shared as widely as they could have been average life expectancy has trended downward in recent years income and wealth polarization have increased social mobility has steadily eroded education and health outcomes are suboptimal and while the poverty rate is falling it remains higher than in other advanced economies said the imf chief we believe that more attention is warranted to promoting inclusive growth to social outcomes more into line with the good macroeconomic developments lagarde said highlighting policies such as instituting paid family leave expanding the earned income tax credit and helping working families with child and dependent care despite a positive near term outlook for the u s economy the imf said a deepening of ongoing trade disputes or an abrupt reversal of the recent ebullient financial market conditions represent material risks to the u s economy with concomitant negative outward spillovers these risks are interconnected with trade policy uncertainty an important factor for both domestic and global financial conditions as well as for business investment decisions the imf said
from brandon smith for many years i have examined how wars of all types have been used by the money elite to distract the masses and maintain a certain level of influence over social and political systems but war is not only a useful tool for keeping the status quo some wars particularly world wars are often catalyzed and exploited by those with a globalized agenda as a way to change the way civilizations function and think the goal to influence the masses to abandon their attachments to concepts like individualism nationalism free markets and sovereignty and to embrace collectivism and total globalization that is to say the ideals that globalization idealist hate get blamed for the wars they help start then they introduce their centralized systems as a solution to the problems they created the trade war situation will be no different the public enthusiasm for the trade war by elites within the trump administration cabinet including rothschild banking agent wilber ross council on foreign relations member robert e lighthizer goldman sachs member steve mnuchin and bilderberg attendee mike pompeo showcases a desire based on globalization to perpetuate an escalation in tensions whether or not you agree with the rationalizations behind the trade war the point is the only people who will ultimately benefit from it are those striving for globalization to institute centralization on a global scale the elites need an all encompassing crisis that can be blamed on nationalism protectionism and the free market dynamic they need a threat that will affect and terrify billions of people into demanding intervention by international organizations such as the imf and the bis as well as a rationale to introduce monetary umbrella actions such as the induction of the sdr special drawing rights basket system as a replacement for the u s dollar as the world reserve currency they need something very similar to a world war in this case however it will be more economic than kinetic an economic world war has the distinct potential to cause all the elements of a collapse situation without the damage to vital infrastructure that inevitably comes with a shooting war because of the advantages the strategy provides for globalization idealist i predicted this exact outcome would develop out of the trade war in my article world war iii will be an economic war published in april 2018 here are the trade war developments so far that support this theory collapse of trade talks recent plans for high level trade talks between the u s and china have fallen apart likely by design and so far there are no announced plans to reengage negotiations so all the assumptions in investment circles the last few months that a trade deal would be quickly finalized and vault the dow jones to 30 000 points were obviously a result of wishful thinking in unicorn land abrupt spike in china tariffs the trump administration announcement of a sudden and swift increase in tariffs was not all that surprising to me but it sure seemed to shock the mainstream economic world probably because of the endless talk since january of an imminent deal being brokered the word on one side was that china would fold because they can t survive without exports to u s markets of course the u s only accounts for 18 of chinese exports which is a sizable piece of the pie but hardly a crippling blow to china should the trade war continue for the long term the word on the other side was that trump would fold because he had attached the success of his administration to the success of the stock market and a prolonged trade war would invariably crash stocks this is partially true trump rightly insisted during his presidential campaign that the federal reserve had used quantitative easing qe measures to artificially inflate the stock market bubble for the past several years then after entering the white house he pulled a 180 and began tweeting relentlessly about how stock market highs were due to his administration not the fed now this might seem like insanity until you look at those residing in trump s cabinet who appear to have a globalized agenda and then everything starts to make sense china s retaliation china has raised its tariffs on u s exports to 25 and has all but ended its purchases of u s agricultural goods which is devastating profit margins for american farmers right after massive flooding in the midwest had already hurt planting prospects however china has not yet released a full statement on how it intends to retaliate options on the table include banning exports of rare earth metals to the u s targeting u s companies like google qualcomm or apple with restrictions or bans of their operation in china altogether as the u s has done with huawei dump their extensive holdings of u s treasuries or the most damaging tactic of all drop the u s dollar as the world reserve currency for purchases of chinese goods a prospect i will examine shortly surprise tariffs on mexico another surprise out of left field as trump targeted mexico with 5 tariffs starting next week rising to 25 in the next few months if mexico does not stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the u s this announcement essentially erases the north american trade deal set to be finalized this month if the situation is not resolved as we witnessed with the china trade talks any discussion of a deal being made should be taken with a grain of salt mexico is the largest u s trading partner under china and canada and the third biggest buyer of u s goods a trade war with mexico should be taken as seriously as the trade war with china tariffs against india the u s is ending preferential trade status with india as part of the tariff salvo which effectively places tariffs on over 3 000 different export items once considered duty free india is now considering possible retaliatory measures and has been edging towards closer economic ties with china for a few years this move may push them all the way into china s camp as a side note india and china together make up around one third of the world population tariffs against australia a key ally in the pacific region australia was given exemption from tariffs on steel and aluminum exports to the us however the trump administration is considering removing that exemption which would mean 10 tariffs on australia s aluminum and 25 tariffs on its steel australia only makes up around 6 of the u s aluminum market but the tariffs could be treated as an attack against a long time partner and opposed as a matter of principle we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us trump offers uk a deal if they brexit i predicted the outcome of the brexit vote back in 2016 based on a theory that those who desired globalization were pulling back on real interference as opposed to theatrical interference and were allowing populist movements to gain an apparent foothold in the political arena why so that they could then collapse the everything bubble the central banks had created on the heads of those same movements and blame them for the disaster i also predicted based on the same theory that the brexit would eventually result in a no deal scenario otherwise known as a hard brexit in which the uk would leave the eu without a finalized agreement on future trade so far the theory is holding strong with trump in the uk this week seeking a u s uk trade deal if the uk walks away from the eu this places the two biggest populist movements in the world in direct alliance and should they both fall together economically the history books will surely blame their trade protectionism and overt nationalism rather than the central banks that caused the financial instability in the first place potential tariffs on eu auto industry this event has been hanging over markets like a dark cloud for months and with the latest accelerated tariff moves in may the expectation in june is that trump will pull the trigger on eu auto exports trump s recent courting of the uk as an extended trading partner is also signaling a coming trade war with the eu for now such actions remain uncertain but the timing for those with a globalization agenda would be perfect if the eu was to enter conflict with the u s the outcome of trade escalation will be world economic war if the u s was negotiating from a position of economic strength then tariffs might make perfect sense but as most alternative economists are well aware of u s economic strength is nothing more than a facade hanging by a thin thread the u s needs an extensive manufacturing base that can supply goods as well as jobs directly to the american people in order to properly conduct a trade war we are far too dependent on foreign imports however corporations outsourcing overseas have been given no incentive to bring these jobs and factories back if trump had offered corporate tax cuts in exchange for companies moving manufacturing to u s shores this might have secured america s position in terms of tariffs but the trade war is being conducted in a backwards manner we often hear that the u s consumer is the greatest economic resource we have and the thing that makes u s markets so enticing to foreign export nations it is the reason we were told a year ago that china would fold to u s demands which of course did not happen the fact is the u s consumer market is a fraud the real resource that drives our retail sector is debt massive debt u s household debt is at all time highs and a quarter of americans rely on credit cards for purchases of necessities a large portion of u s retail relies on debt expansion not true wealth and once debt grows beyond the consumers ability to keep up retail starts to decline this is probably why despite increased credit spending overall retail sales in the u s are dwindling in 2019 if u s consumers aren t buying more goods with more credit then where are they spending the money the likely answer is they are taking on new debt to pay off old debts this credit death cycle is exactly what happened just before the crash of 2008 and it is happening again today if the u s consumer market is breaking down then there is no incentive for foreign exporters to capitulate to u s trade demands this means that the trade war will continue unabated possible deals will be announced to keep the public absorbed in the chaos and to keep stock markets from falling too quickly however as we saw with china a trade deal announced almost every month for a year does not ensure that a trade deal will be made real as this situation drags on into winter i expect that the u s china conflict will mutate into a global conflict meaning countries are going to start taking sides already the u s is drawing battle lines by seeking trade war alliances with japan and south korea whether or not this bears fruit is yet to be determined japan s long time blood feud with china almost guarantees they will side with the u s in an economic war but china is one of their largest export markets and the conflict would hurt them badly south korea s dependence on u s protection against north korea also makes their participation a good bet but most other nations have been drifting away from the u s for some time russia and china have already secured a pact through bilateral trade agreements parts of europe including germany have been building close economic ties with china for the past decade i wrote about this relationshipextensively in 2017 and predicted that in the event of a global economic crisis germany and china would form an alliance most of southern asia will undoubtedly side with china as these nations are so interdependent with the chinese economy it would be unthinkable to separate australia is also heavily reliant on china as an export market and with u s tariffs poisoning the well i believe the australians are much more likely to side with china than the u s in a trade war india is uncertain but again with the threat of u s tariffs along with the factor of border proximity india is probably going to join with the chinese the nuclear option the weapon that will inevitably end the trade war and the u s economy is the abandonment of the u s dollar by multiple nations as the world reserve currency the loss of reserve status would crush our ability to create debt without consequences this is the one pillar left holding up u s economic power and make no mistake globalization idealist are perfectly positioned to benefit from this event the introduction of a new global currency system tied to the imf special drawing rights sdr basket has been hinted at time and again by various elites including most recently mohamed el erian in 2017 who suggested the sdr could be used as a reserve currency system to combat the dangers of populist nationalism the imf has also been very vocal about its excitement over blockchain and cryptocurrency technology which they hope to use to create their own digital currency system in the near future a global trade war is a dream scenario for those who want

students via skype to make ends meet jack gruber usa today in sunny miami bilingual elementary teacher mari corugedo has 26 years of experience a master s degree and a passion for helping spanish speaking students quickly learn english her annual compensation for those skills 64 000 plus benefits that doesn t go far in this popular coastal city where median rent has shot up to almost 2 000 per month and the median mortgage is almost 1 300 per month before taxes or insurance according to the real estate site zillow we spend a good 30 to 40 of our income on our mortgage said corugedo 52 i would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami loading a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in just 13 of the 291 metro areas analyzed loading the johnstown pennsylvania metro area is one of them the former steelworker town about 90 minutes east of pittsburgh is a distressed city with a low tax base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis loading new teachers can also afford to live in springfield ohio starting salaries in the school district are currently about 37 000 and rising to 37 789 next year plus the current contract gives teachers an annual bonus of 1 000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said loading how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of education according to the economic policy institute the nonprofit think tank which receives funding from labor unions examined decades of federal data growing unrest over low pay sparked teacher walkouts last year in states such as arizona oklahoma and west virginia wages have continued to be at the heart of teacher demonstrations in 2019 loading have teacher strikes worked how a west

teacher raises among democrats running for president former vice president joe biden has proposed tripling federal money for low income schools in part to give teachers raises u s sen kamala harris from california wants to give the average american teacher a 13 500 raise or enough to cover the gap between teachers and other college educated workers that would cost the federal government about 315 billion over 10 years many mid career teachers need a side hustle for now just under half of the metropolitan areas studied 135 are affordable for teachers earning a median wage loading for

family anytime soon we haven t been able to save for the down payment yet baur said it s hard to save when things keep getting more expensive these mid career teachers are still struggling in some areas teachers are struggling because their pay doesn t increase much even as they gain more years of experience on average in the metros analyzed usa today found that elementary school teachers salaries grow by 31 322 after taxes as they moved from the bottom to the top of the pay scale but in some metro areas teachers salaries increased far less than that in the districts around enid

than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
welcome to the weekly tortoise credit podcast iâ m greg haendel senior portfolio manager at tortoise prior to 1492 when christopher columbus sailed the ocean blue some people in europe and asia believed the earth was flat although columbus sailed the ocean blue to try to find a new trade route to india from spain on october 12th 1492 columbus sighted land in north america and changed history although his original mission wasnâ t to discover north america or prove the earth is round he did just that prior to july 2009 many economists and academics believed that the theoretical floor on interest rates was 0 prior to 2009 an environment with negative interest rates was simply an academic and theoretical exercise with unknown consequences similar in a way to sailing to the end of the map in what was thought to be a flat world in july 2009 swedenâ s central bank cut its overnight deposit rate to 0 25 followed by the european central bank breaching the zero bound in june 2014 and several other countries including japan thereafter in todayâ s podcast we will discuss some of the causes of negative interest rates the composition of negative debt globally what negative yields are telling us and some of the estimated repercussions both positive and negative the total value of negative yielding debt globally peaked in mid 2016 at around 12 5 trillion retreated to roughly 8 trillion early in the fourth quarter of 2018 and has since rebounded to approximately 10 6 trillion most recently with an increase of roughly 20 year to date further negative yielding debt now makes up almost 20 of the total market capitalization of the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index japan accounts for the largest portion of negative yielding debt at approximately 6 7 trillion or just below 2 3rds of the global amount eurozone debt at approximately 3 8 trillion accounts for most of the remaining global stock of negative yielding debt interestingly although the majority of negative yielding eurozone debt is sovereign related roughly 800 billion of this negative yielding debt is credit related corporate debt or supranational debt in fact in europe sanofi and louis vuitton moet hennessy recently issued bonds that pay zero interest and were issued at a small premium to their redemption value at maturity thereby generating a negative yield currently all japanese and german sovereign bonds denominated in their respective currencies with a maturity of 10 years or less have a negative yield while the same holds for all french sovereign bonds with a maturity of eight years or less you may be asking yourself what causes negative interest rates or negative yields and who in their right mind would ever buy a negative yielding debt instrument thereby essentially paying someone to lend them money letâ s start by addressing the causes of negative interest rates or negative yields first and foremost negative yields can simply be a consequence of active central bank monetary policy in a world where bond supply and demand are not balanced in this case when central banks institute a negative short term deposit rate in concert with substantially large central bank asset purchases of intermediate to longer maturity sovereign bonds it can certainly drive bond yields negative second negative yields can potentially forecast a sharp economic slowdown which as a consequence could lead to an increase in defaults in the future in this case return of capital is more important than return on capital in this example bank deposits rates would have to be negative and realistically it couldnâ t make sense to just stuff your money under your mattress third the fear or forecast of future deflation can cause negative yields whereby expected deflation pushes real yields positive in this case paying up now and receiving less nominal money in the future can be profitable if the price of goods falls substantially during that investment horizon fourth negative yields can be the consequence of the ecology of the current market participants for passive investors indexers or etfs not owning the negative yielding bonds if they are part of the underlying index introduces potential tracking error further some financial institutions such as banks or insurance companies face strict regulations with their balance sheet holdings many of these institutions must hold a regulatory minimum amount of liquid assets while some of this sovereign debt may hold a zero risk based capital weighting as a result this forces them to buy negative yielding bonds over what could be an even more negative yielding central bank deposit rate fifth investors speculating on additional central bank monetary policy easing in this case investors are relying upon the greater fool theory that they can make money buying a negative yielding bond as long as they can sell it with an even greater negative yield prior to maturity as you can see there are several causes of negative interest rates further there are a multitude of potential buyers of negative yielding bonds depending upon the root cause or causes of the negative rates these buyers include most notably central banks followed by regulated financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies passive bond investors such as indexers or etfs speculators such as hedge funds and even some ordinary investors investing in very non ordinary market environments the largest anticipated benefit from negative yields is to drive investors out of perceived safe sovereign bonds and into riskier assets by forcing this move it is believed financial conditions will ease and economic growth will be promoted in essence central banks are trying to crowd investors out of risk free assets and into riskier assets such as corporate loans or personal loans thereby trying to jumpstart the economy in fact former fed chair ben bernanke wrote an op ed in the washington post in early november 2010 entitled â what the fed did and why supporting the recovery and sustaining price stabilityâ whereby he addresses what central banks are trying to achieve with actions such as these another related and potential benefit to negative yields is to increase inflation in an environment of stubbornly low inflation other potential side effects to negative interest rates include weakening your currency relative to your trading partners all else equal negative rates can also help limit the downside to commodity prices on the supply side low rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding commodity reserves in the ground thereby limiting supply on the demand side low or negative risk free rates push down expected returns across most assets thereby increasing the attractiveness of buying commodities all else equal negative interest rates donâ t come without a cost potential negative side effects include lower bank profitability impaired functioning of the money markets reduced liquidity for negative yielding debt a limited central bank toolset to address a future recession excessive borrowing and excessive leverage by individuals corporations and sovereign countries and future financial bubbles today we believe the increase in the global debt stock of negative yielding bonds is signaling a slowdown in global growth low inflation in many regions and a renewed aggressiveness by many global central banks to attempt to jumpstart their economies despite relatively low interest rates in the u s our sovereign government bonds remain one of the highest yielding amongst other developed countries as a result given the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the substantial increase in negative yielding debt globally it will be difficult for u s treasury yields to trend substantially higher in the near term absent an inflation scare which we donâ t predict anytime soon

open this photo in gallery mario draghi president of the european central bank attends a news conference in vilnius lithuania on june 6 2019 ints kalnins reuters the european central bank on thursday ruled out raising interest rates in the next year and even opened the door to cutting them or buying more bonds as risk factors such as a global trade war and brexit drag the euro zone economy down hoping to maintain the flow of credit to the economy it also offered to effectively pay banks to borrow from it and lend that money on to the real economy with the bloc s inflation prospects diminishing rapidly ecb president mario draghi sought to reassure investors that the central bank was ready to act if needed to support an economy hurt by weaker global trade and that it could even resort to once taboo measures he said policy makers had started to discuss options such as cuts to the ecb s already record low rates further pushing out the timing of any hike or resuming a 2 6 trillion about 3 9 trillion bond buying program that only ended in december several members raised the possibility of further rate cuts other members raised the possibility of restarting the asset purchase program or further extensions in the forward guidance mr draghi said after a meeting of the ecb s policy making governing council the unexpectedly dovish stance comes as a trade war between the united states and china overshadows the global economy and especially export oriented euro zone countries such as germany the euro and euro zone bond yields rose after mr draghi s comments while bank shares and inflation expectations fell as investors saw his hints at a rate cut as too timid notably investors took the ecb s new message that rates would remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 as ruling out any cut until then in march the bank had said rates would stay at record lows until at least the end of this year tltro terms the ecb said it would give banks credit at rates just 10 basis points above its minus 0 4 per cent deposit rate paying them to take its money in other words provided they beat the ecb s lending benchmarks in a new targeted longer term refinancing operation or tltro with pervasive uncertainty already denting trade big central banks such as the ecb and the u s federal reserve appear to have given up on plans to tighten policy and markets are now positioned for easing although mr draghi emphasized that the ecb s policy arsenal is from exhausted analysts point out that its remaining tools lack the potency of earlier measures rates are already at record lows the bank s balance sheet is already bloated and government bonds yields are depressed economists polled by reuters expect rates to stay unchanged and forecast a first rate hike only in 2021 they also expect the bank s next move to entail policy easing rather than tightening with rates already at zero per cent and no fiscal levers to pull options are somewhat limited turning the qe taps back on by the end of the year is an increasingly probable scenario said nancy curtin chief investment officer at close brothers asset management mr draghi himself said central banks and the markets have been navigating troubled waters for years and may continue to do so now we say that monetary policy is non conventional and we are far away from normalization because the rest of the world the rest of the challenges are far away from being normalized he said it s been like that now for many many many years following first the financial crisis then the sovereign debt crisis then the greek crisis and now we have the threat of rising protectionism the geopolitical dangers that we have seen we have developments in the euro zone itself risks he also said risks to the economy were tilted to the downside the central bank revised up its growth projection for this year to 1 2 per cent but cut them to 1 4 per cent for both 2020 and 2021 inflation forecasts were also tweaked at philip lane s first policy meeting as ecb chief economist prices are now predicted to rise 1 3 per cent this year 1 4 per cent next year and 1 6 per cent in 2021 with the ecb officially targeting an inflation rate of just below 2 per cent it still has some way to climb however inflation has undershot this since 2013 and projections suggest it will continue to miss it for years to come the ecb s problem is the global trade war shows no sign of de escalating italy is once again in conflict with the european commission german industry continues to post dismal figures stock markets are tumbling and a hard brexit is threatened and on top of that inflation expectations the ecb s top worry are steadily declining raising the risk they become dislodged thereby perpetuating weak price growth mr draghi said he saw no probability of deflation however and a low probability of recession there is no probability of deflation there is very low probability of recession there are no threats of deanchoring of inflation expectations he said the ecb s favoured gauge of market inflation expectations had earlier fallen to its lowest since 2016 while money market pricing showed investors see almost a 70 per cent chance of a 10 basis point cut in ecb rates by the end of the year let s be clear another change to forward guidance is just another step to align the ecb s forward guidance with market expectations not the other way around said carsten brzeski chief economist ing germany
