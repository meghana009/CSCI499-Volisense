file economic expert hany tawfik first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund david lipton attends a discussion are we safer the case for updating bagehot during the imf world bank annual meetings in washington u s october 8 2016 reuters yuri gripas cairo may 2019 though the float has been wreaking havoc on prices across the board and especially those of imported goods the steep exchange rate hike could serve as a push for local manufacturers a high dollar to pound exchange rate would also pave the way to boost exports as it translates into competitive prices on the international market those factors if coupled with economic reforms would all lead to significant economic growth a stronger industrial sector that fulfills market needs would decrease our dependence on imports without enforcing import barriers as well as decreasing deficits in the balance of payments bop economic expert hany tawfik argues that since currency value is determined by its purchasing power a currency s performance would improve as production increases and pushes prices down if our savings are much less than what is needed for investments if our consumption is higher than our production and if our imports are much higher than our exports our currency value would be low and the annual inflation rate would increase tawfik says to avoid such situations we need increases in investments production and exports china s savings rate is 45 of income per annum that is why it has a lot of investments but it is also important to remember that currency value does not necessarily represent the economic performance of countries nor does it reflect true supply demand dynamics locally and internationally the currencies of japan a developed high income country and middle income superpowers such as china russia india and brazil are each equivalent to below 1 in worth politics also play a major role in determining a currency s value for instance the value of the us dollar is linked to both its economic performance as well as to oil prices due to petrodollars or revenues received from the sale of oil well into the second year since the float tawfik argues that the decision was essential to remain competitive in the global market and reflect the currency s true market price egypt has not fully floated the currency the central bank of egypt can still play a role in determining the exchange rate tawfik stresses explaining that the reserves grew due to hot money as foreigners would convert their dollars into egyptian pounds to benefit from high interest rates only to later convert their money back into dollars at a possibly lower rate that is why fixing the exchange rate is very dangerous he adds keeping our exchange rate low on purpose made importing cheaper than manufacturing locally tawfik argues he adds that someone in the textile business for instance would import products from china rather than manufacture them because they were cheaper given the old lower than value exchange rate after the flotation however the situation was reversed as manufacturing became a more cost effective option for many some for instance have opted to recycle plastic in toy making instead of importing the raw material egypt has stabilized and normalized the economy some countries never make it to sustainable growth from stabilization first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund david lipton said at a lecture at the american university in cairo in may 2018 he added that for egypt s economy to grow the next step would be to formalize in the informal sector and open for trade lipton also argued that it is important for egypt s private sector to grow and create jobs at a scale that matches population growth to achieve that lipton suggested creating opportunities for business formulation and growth and increasing competition businesses should cater to the local market as well as global competition to continuously improve he stipulated that a business should work toward accomplishing growth as opposed to just profit maximization increasing the value added tax to cover subsidies causes a rise in prices on the short term lipton argued however it is beneficial on the long run if coupled with lifting subsidies as vat reduces tax evasion and can be a channel to development energy subsidies make up between 8 9 of gdp lipton added lipton added that although the recent monetary policy aims to lower inflation rates printing paper currency drives inflation up tawfik indicates that the current gdp growth is a consequence of printing money and paying construction companies to build new cities as opposed to being driven by production that is a malignant growth coupled with an increase in debts there is growth due to the hike in loans but no development he argues tawfik elaborated that building infrastructure is important but lacks sustainability since in parallel there must be a focus on building new factories and helping stumbling ones for foreign direct investment to grow tawfik argues that corruption needs to be addressed he adds that he believes zohr gas shouldn t be exported but rather used for local energy needs especially factories tawfik and lipton also argue that it is necessary to match production to the local market s needs before focusing on exporting if we export the purchasing power would increase margins on the global scale are very low and the competition is heated compared to the domestic market thus producers would mainly target the domestic market and then export developing corporate egypt would lead to a trickle down effect in terms of income tawfik says by the same token lipton noted that egypt should get rid of impediments facing technological development as the world is going in that direction at a very fast pace he gave the example of mexico which underwent a boost in the telecommunications segment by 60 and suggested that egypt focus on the same sector as well on the other hand lipton shed light on the importance of developing social safety networks setting policies guaranteeing equal income distribution and securing women s economic rights tawfik similarly stresses developing education healthcare and providing monetary subsidies to those who deserve it but adds that a family shouldn t receive subsidies for their third child to limit population growth the funding for such reforms and initiatives can be made available by addressing tax evasion which has reached le 400 500 billion per year tawfik adds he highlights that resolving this may take 10 years as it is tied to financial inclusion it is then easier to regulate electronic payments as opposed to cash as lipton noted taxes represent only 13 of egypt s gdp while the rest comes from government revenues such as those from the suez canal lastly for the economy to take further steps to move from stabilization to growth tawfik argues that structural adjustment to egypt s huge administrative body are key at the moment egypt has the highest ratio of one public employee for every 10 citizens in china for instance the rate is one for every 300 until all these reforms are implemented the middle class will continue to suffer for a while tawfik concludes the article was published in business today egypt july 2018 issue
u s review markets jitter as trade war escalates fear around the trade war remained top of mind for market participants this week and helped instigate another inversion of the yield curve there is no denying that the yield curve has inverted prior to each of the past six recessions but we stand by our previously stated deduction that it alone does not necessarily mean we are headed for an impending downturn that said the trade war remains the largest downside risk to the outlook increased tariffs have yet to manifest themselves in steep increases in consumer goods prices however the potential is there markets jitter as trade war escalates fear around the trade war remained top of mind for market participants this week and helped instigate another inversion of the yield curve the yield curve has been flirting with inversion for the past six months but recent escalation in the trade war has brought fear of an imminent recession back into the fore an inversion of the yield curve can signal investor suspicion about the pace of future growth or if the fed will need to cut rates the escalating trade war has boosted uncertainty about growth while the market implied probability of a rate cut by year end continues to rise top chart there is no denying that the yield curve has inverted prior to each of the past seven recessions but we stand by our previously stated deduction that it alone does not necessarily mean we are headed for an impending downturn that said the trade war remains the largest downside risk to the outlook a couple of weeks ago the trump administration hiked tariffs to 25 from 10 on an estimated 200 billion of chinese imports and threatened to impose the 25 tariff on all remaining goods from china in response china announced a hike to tariffs on u s imports while exports to china account for less than 8 of total u s exports middle chart the trade war may be beginning to have rippling effects throughout the economy even if president trump s tariff strategy gives way to better relations with our trading partners and tariffs are eventually rolled back they have already began to affect corporate supply chains and are expected to weigh on profits this year at the end of the day remember tariffs are taxes they tend to raise the price of imported goods for u s consumers and producers which could cause prices of domestic goods that compete with these imports to rise increased tariffs have yet to manifest themselves in steep increases in consumer goods prices however at 1 6 on a year over year basis in april core pce inflation remains below the fed s target bottom chart the core pce deflator did rise 0 25 in april which is the largest monthly increase since october 2017 and perhaps provides support to chair powell s assertion that the recent soft patch in inflation was temporary recall these figures reflect april prices before the recent escalation in the trade war so there may be scope for prices to rise in coming months the broader impact of tariffs say via investment decisions is more difficult to quantify this morning president trump threatened a 5 tariff on mexican imports quoted to start on june 10 to combat illegal migration with little sign of a resolution to the escalating and expanding trade war growth expectations will likely trend lower in coming months the trade skirmish is escalating just as many economists had expected the economy to slow from the first quarter s artificially high headline number of 3 1 indeed first quarter final domestic demand growth was the weakest it has been in nearly six years with trade risks becoming increasingly important to the outlook and inflation remaining comfortably south of the fed s 2 target the fed may need less of a reason to move from its patient stance and cut rates earlier than currently expected u s outlook ism manufacturing monday markets will be watching the ism manufacturing index more closely than usual on monday last week the preliminary markit pmi fell to a nine year low sparking fears that the recent escalation in trade tensions with china is snuffing out the expansion other purchasing managers indices have held up better however an ism equivalent average of the regional fed pmis signals the pace of manufacturing output was little changed last month we expect the ism index to signal a further slowdown in factory activity in may but to remain in expansion territory an unexpectedly weak reading would pile on to the market s recent concerns about growth in light of the latest trade developments however with manufacturing accounting for only 12 of u s output it would take a severe drop in the index for the fed to push aside its patient stance and cut rates previous 52 8 wells fargo 52 1 consensus 53 0 ism non manufacturing wednesday given that the ism non manufacturing index reflects the remaining 88 of the u s economy wednesday s ism release will be more telling about the state of growth similar to its manufacturing counterpart the preliminary read of the markit service sector pmi fell in may and added to concerns about u s growth continuing to slow service sector surveys from the regional federal reserve banks also showed activity slowed in may albeit from an eight month high in april we therefore look for the ism non manufacturing index to be little changed for may a downside miss would signal that the slowdown in growth extends beyond the external facing parts of the economy most exposed to trade fed officials however were already expecting growth to moderate this year as fiscal stimulus fades as long as the non manufacturing index stays around the mid 50s we would not expect it to shift the fed s near term policy stance previous 55 5 wells fargo 55 4 consensus 55 7 employment friday hiring likely cooled in may after a surprisingly strong gain of 263 000 jobs in april we expect payroll growth to slow in may but at 180 000 to remain close to its recent trend initial jobless claims have moved up since april but are on par with their average since the start of the year given recent swings in the labor force we expect the unemployment rate to rise to 3 7 while average hourly earnings should rise 0 3 the quick escalation in the trade war this month was unlikely to have affected the employment numbers which were based on employment in the middle of the month another solid read on hiring would therefore signal to the fomc that the labor market was humming along ahead of recent concerns a marked miss to the downside on the other hand would suggest that the growth outlook was already cooling and potentially pull forward expectations of the fomc adjusting policy with a rate cut previous 263k wells fargo 180k consensus 185k global review bank of canada upbeat italy stirs the pot despite another soft gdp print policymakers at the bank of canada expressed optimism this week that the slowdown in growth in late 2018 early 2019 will prove to be temporary italian sovereign bond spreads crept higher this week as concerns about italy s fiscal outlook returned to the headlines the european commission projects that under current policy the italian budget deficit will rise to 3 5 in 2020 a clear violation of the bloc s rules if deputy prime minister matteo salvini has his way and enacts a flat tax the deficit may be even larger potentially setting up another fiscal showdown between brussels and rome this fall bank of canada upbeat italy stirs the pot the bank of canada boc met this week and like many of the world s central banks was forced to reckon with the slowdown in global growth over the past few quarters data released this morning showed the canadian economy growing at just 0 4 on an annualized basis in q1 the second consecutive sub 1 reading see chart on page one despite the soft print the boc adopted a relatively upbeat tone noting in its statement that recent data have reinforced the governing council s view that the slowdown in late 2018 and early 2019 was temporary the boc pointed to a recovery in the oil sector and housing market indicators that point to a more stable national market albeit with continued weakness in some regions another recent bright spot has been the robust canadian labor market canadian payrolls rose nearly 107 000 in april the largest gain on record while some of the recent strength can be attributed to a jump in part time employment full time employment in canada is up 1 6 over the past year even better than the 1 3 pace in the united states at present financial markets are only pricing in 25 bps of easing by the boc over the next twelve months compared to 69 bps in the united states we expect the boc to be on hold through the end of the year but think the boc may start to hike again early in 2020 italian sovereign bond spreads over german bunds continued to creep higher this week as concerns about italy s fiscal outlook returned to the headlines middle chart after all of the hand wringing last fall italy s budget deficit for 2019 is projected to be 2 5 up only a bit from 2 1 in 2018 given in part how much the italian economy has slowed over the past few quarters bottom chart italy has managed to avoid any financial penalties from the european union for this fiscal slippage as 2020 comes into focus however the european commission ec this week expressed concern over the fiscal outlook despite forecasting faster growth and inflation in italy next year the ec projects that the budget deficit will widen to 3 5 a clear violation of european union rules italy introduced a citizens income and some more generous pension provisions earlier this year that are already baked into the aforementioned ec projections however additional fiscal easing may still be around the corner deputy prime minister matteo salvini emboldened by his party s strong showing in the european parliament elections has continued to push for fiscal and economic reforms that include among other things a flat tax that would likely widen the deficit even further if salvini can push through tax cuts of some sort the clash between rome and brussels could be similar to or even worse than the one that occurred in the second half of last year the conflict would likely ramp up in september october when italy will have to draft and submit a budget plan to european union officials if the coalition between salvini s party lega and the five star movement falls apart in the coming months italy could have national elections later this year for the second year in a row global outlook reserve bank of australia tuesday the reserve bank of australia rba will meet next tuesday and evaluate whether conditions have evolved such that the first rate cut since 2016 is warranted q1 2019 real gdp growth in australia will be released the same day and could show economic growth slowing to below 2 on a year over year basis australia s economic linkages to china are relatively high compared to most other developed economies and the slowdown in china has likely contributed to some of the weakness in australia like canada the australian housing market is currently going through a soft patch and inflation has remained subdued up about 1 5 through the first quarter against this backdrop financial markets are pricing in roughly 68 bps of easing by the rba over the next 12 months given that the u s china trade spat has only worsened since the last rba meeting it would not surprise us if the rba cuts its main policy rate 25 bps next week previous 1 50 consensus 1 25 european central bank thursday monetary policymakers in europe will meet next week to discuss the ailing eurozone economy real gdp growth was a bit stronger in q1 but it still registered an anemic 1 2 year over year the data thus far in the second quarter suggest that the economy is continuing to tread water around this pace the markit eurozone composite pmi was 51 6 in may up 0 1 from april and flat from march the may manufacturing pmi at 47 7 remained in contractionary territory the european central bank ecb will announce the parameters for its targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros next week but past that our expectation is for the central bank to more or less maintain its wait and see approach the economy has not weakened enough to warrant a full reversal into an easing cycle but it remains a ways off from the first rate hike our expectation is for the ecb s policy rates to remain on hold for the remainder of the year but gradually exit negative territory in 2020 previous 0 40 wells fargo 0 40 consensus 0 40 deposit rate reserve bank of india thursday in the wake of prime minister narendra modi s reelection the reserve bank of india rbi will meet next thursday data on real gdp growth in india were released this morning and showed the economy expanded 5 8 year over year in q1 2019 though strong relative to most other major economies at present this still marked the slowest pace of growth since 2014 inflation also remains firmly in control the rbi targets consumer price inflation of 4 within a 2 range and price growth is currently running at about 3 slower growth and inflation have prompted some to speculate that the rbi might cut interest rates at an upcoming meeting financial markets appear to be pricing in about 39 bps of easing over the next 12 months the rbi has already cut rates 50 bps this year and with some of the uncertainty in the economy likely easing post election it looks like a close call whether the rbi will keep easing or wait to see how the economy reacts to previous rate cuts previous 5 75 consensus 5 50 reverse repo rate point of view interest rate watch inverted for real for all the talk about how this time is different the recent inversion of the yield curve appears to have all of the characteristics of past inversions the yield curve is an indication of bond investors views of future economic conditions and those views have been downgraded considerably after trade negotiations with china took a bearish turn earlier this month the key take away from the negative turn in trade talks was that china never intended to fulfill any agreement made with the united states and finally balked when u s negotiators insisted on including repercussions for non compliance in any agreement global growth is now likely to slow even further and remain slower for longer which has pulled down long term rates in germany and the united states the greater influence of slower global economic growth and lower and even negative interest rates overseas is the most cited reason so many folks have been so quick to dismiss the most recent inversion of the yield curve which has seen the yield on both the 10 year and 2 year treasury note fall below the federal funds rate the implicit assumption here is that the bond market is more concerned about the u s economy s long term and near term prospects than the federal reserve is the near term data look fairly benign real consumer spending was unchanged in april but healthy gains in march put q2 consumer spending on a pace to rise at a 3 annual rate consumer confidence also rebounded solidly and jobless claims remain near their cycle lows data from the manufacturing sector are worrisome with industrial production down year over year and orders clearly decelerating that said the most recent round of fed manufacturing surveys was somewhat more positive while all this seems reassuring most of this data reflect activity and sentiment prior to the intensification of trade talks even the better news on consumer spending says more about what happened two months ago that what is happening today private final demand has clearly lost momentum leaving the economy more vulnerable to an external shock or policy mistake credit market insights starts with a three the 30 year fixed rate mortgage rate dropped into the three range this week for the first time since january 2018 swirling uncertainty surrounding trade and global growth have sparked a sustained rally in longer term treasurys causing the 10 yearthree month yield curve to invert this week the 10 year is currently yielding only 2 2 the lowest since 2017 such a steep drop in mortgage rates will likely provide a boost or at least a floor to housing in coming months the domestic housing market is fairly insulated from the issues driving investors into safe assets and could therefore see a slight pickup at the same time overall growth weakens so long as the growing risk off attitude on wall street doesn t take a turn onto main street moreover the 3 99 rate down seven bps since just last week reported by freddie mac and highlighted by the media represents a so called top tier rate as it assumes a 20 down payment and otherwise sterling buyer credit thus many potential homebuyers may not yet be seeing a three handle from their bank mortgage bankers suggest it may take several weeks of continued strength in the bond market before rates truly push into the three range for a majority of future homebuyers nevertheless it was only a few quarters ago that the 30 year rate was about to breach 5 while the spring housing rebound many expected has not quite materialized the market has certainly stabilized likely due in large part to lower rates which should continue to provide support topic of the week do deficits still matter the recent widening in the federal budget deficit and persistently low yields on u s treasury securities have led some observers to question the idea that larger deficits lead to higher interest rates or even if deficits matter at all using the international monetary fund s measure of the general government budget deficit the united states is currently running one of the largest consolidated budget deficits in the developed world table to right can the united states really run large budget deficits indefinitely with minimal consequences in our view yields on treasury securities have remained low in the face of bigger deficits for both cyclical and structural reasons on the cyclical side a dovish turn by the fed and falling growth inflation expectations have weighed on yields dominating the upward pressure from more government debt issuance net sovereign bond issuance in other major foreign economies has also been quite low recently due to both fiscal consolidation and to quantitative easing programs by foreign central banks bottom chart these factors probably have contributed to downward pressure on u s government bond yields as well econometric analysis that attempts to control for factors like these suggests that deficits still exert upward pressure on yields all else equal on the structural side the united states enjoys many built in advantages that make financing large deficits easier the u s dollar is the world s reserve currency the u s economy is the largest in the world and the treasury market is the gold standard for liquid safe assets could some of these circumstances change one day making it much harder to finance structurally large budget deficits of course though when or whether they will is up for debate in our view it is not that deficits no longer matter rather favorable circumstances for large scale sovereign debt issuance exist today but that does not mean they will exist forever for further reading see our recent special report do deficits still matter
former president cristina fernández de kirchner has always kept one foot on the balcony and the other on mercury in her volatile two terms in office she picked fights with agribusiness the international monetary fund the clarín media empire even screen idol ricardo darín leaving argentines the worse for her convulsions now just in time for national elections the willful peronist is back again sowing disruption fernández de kirchner was expected to stage a political comeback by challenging incumbent president mauricio macri who after a bruising fiscal retrenchment is struggling with mounting debt and inflation and sagging approval ratings instead she startled loyalists and rivals alike by announcing her candidacy for vice president on a ticket led by her former cabinet chief and later harsh critic alberto fernandez who is not related the manoeuvre rattled the political establishment and the excitable argentine news cycle was fernández de kirchner caving to the reality that she is too divisive a figure to return to the presidency was this a sleight of hand with her playing vladimir putin fernández s dmitry medvedev or was it all an attempt to distract argentines from her legal woes her trial on serial corruption charges began may 21 just months before the balloting voters will have the last word in october but whoever wins the election will face the same narrowing policy choices and even less room to improvise than macri although a projected record harvest pumps hope into the feeble economy the country s gross domestic product shrank 2 5 percent in 2018 and is down 6 8 percent from a year ago investor reticence has undermined the peso which lost half its value in 2018 and remains one of the most vulnerable currencies in emerging markets according to oxford economics in a land in thrall to the dollar a weakened peso stokes inflation now topping a wage melting 50 percent argentina s relapse has been remarkable just two years ago the us 637 billion economy looked to be on the mend from a decade and a half of misgovernment under the vaporous kirchners néstor from 2003 to 2007 then his wife cristina from 2007 2015 who turned south america s second largest market into an international financial pariah having settled terms with angry bondholders or debt vultures as fernández de kirchner called them macri lifted currency controls and parlayed the country s new aura into credibility and hard currency loans in mid 2017 he successfully floated a century bond with an unheard of 100 year maturity investors piled in and argentina looked to be on track to morph into a normal country in macri s words it didn t a record drought in the grain belt took its toll in 2018 so did unforced errors such as ill advised monetary policy the central bank lowered interest rates even as high inflation persisted and botched communications by the macri government enter the talk of a uschina trade war rising us interest rates and an emerging markets sell off by early this year the storied century bonds had become the stuff of memes part of the blame may lie with the imf which in six decades has struck 22 agreements with argentina most of them ending in routs last year s us 50 billion deal was the largest country loan the imf has ever given when even that failed to reassure creditors the imf added on another us 7 billion macri might have used that nest egg to retire debt or build up hard currency reserves instead he bought pesos former imf executive director héctor torres now senior fellow with the centre for international governance innovation s international law research program recently wrote officially the imf frowns on countries diverting loans to rescue tanking currencies but argentina s serial crashes have defied the orthodoxy the imf should really have allowed this all along if it was going into the business of saving argentina from itself said monica de bolle director of the latin american programme at johns hopkins university s school of advanced international studies with a highly dollarised economy like argentina s there s really nothing else for the fund to do if it wants to stay engaged and at this point staying engaged is a must because of the political fallout for the institution argentina is down but hasn t returned to the serial crises of the recent past macri s belated fiscal containment is expected to ease gross government debt from 79 percent of gdp to 70 percent by 2020 and possibly eliminate the primary deficit this year according to oxford economics and while much has been said of macri s blunders he s won plaudits for eschewing populist feel good measures by keeping money tight and hewing to budget cuts anchored by the revised imf rescue package the economic slump is expected eventually to turn yet continued austerity spells no imminent relief for crisisweary argentines who have seen unemployment spike to 9 and borrowing rates that the economist intelligence unit called cripplingly high it s like taking antibiotics said goldman sachs senior economist alberto ramos eventually the fiscal measures will kick in but it s hard to see that in the middle of a painful adjustment macri s opponents count on leveraging that pain for advantage at the ballot box presidential campaigns are petri dishes for bombast and populist promises but governing is another matter just ask jair bolsonaro brazil s splenetic rightwing leader who despite a lacklustre economy and five bruising months in office has yet to step off the campaign stump with the benefit of hindsight we could say macri ought to have moved more quickly to adjust the economy when he had the chance and that by delaying he s made the adjustment more difficult economic historian victor bulmer thomas honorary professor at the institute of the americas university college london told me but you have to distinguish between rhetoric and reality the peronists could gain electoral traction with harsh talk yet it s difficult to see what they would do differently there is no magic here argentina could do without magic market sentiment is fragile we ve lost degrees of freedom to manage the economy said ramos we don t need radical policy change just to continue down the road of fiscal consolidation that logic could revive macri s flagging fortunes or boost those of a credible centrist alternative this generation of argentines is different as much as they dislike the current situation they remember the trauma of the 1980s debt crisis and currency rout and they don t want to go through that again said bulmer thomas hence the peronist nod to alberto fernández an electoral novice who nonetheless is known as a conciliator and policy pragmatist if he frames his candidacy as moderate and the market believes he and not cristina is in charge and that his presidency will make argentina a trustworthy borrower you could get a happy ending for their ticket said oxford economics chief latin america analyst carlos de sousa but that s a lot of ifs
my unpublished 100 000 word book the financial jigsaw is being serialised here weekly in 100 issues by peter j underwood author quote of the week be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don t matter and those who matter don t mind bernard m baruch as we end this chapter on national economies it is worth reminding ourselves of the toxic effects of globalisation and financialisation one of the big problems affecting national governments is the free movement of capital in our highly connected world it has not been possible in the space allowed to describe fully how the international and global financial markets affect national economies here is an article worth reading which explains in more detail so as to better understand how the system of off shore finance works this essay focuses on the murky financial realm known as offshore finance it shows that offshore finance is not solely about capital moving beyond the reach of states but involves the rampant unbundling and commercialisation of state sovereignty itself the video is well worth watching in its entirety the defenders of globalization say that people have to be ready to adapt to this process yet when adaptation means seeing a worsening of one s standard of living accompanied by a loss of social cohesion it s not surprising that frustration and discontent grow over time deprived of the ability to expand into ever new territories the west will gradually sink into stagnation poverty and domestic disorder at that point the world will be in a state of a genuine bi polar cold war a war of political and economic attrition whose outcome is currently impossible to predict here is the link to last week issue 53 now that brexit will not be coming to a conclusion for months yet after three years i will continue to provide weekly updates as events progress brexit update 31st may 2019 voting results the brexit deadline remains 31st october 2019 and stays in place unless the next pm can get parliament to agree a new exit plan let the battle for tory leadership begin with boris johnson the preferred candidate at present this war will continue probably until the end of july so i will continue to monitor the battles as they progress because the next pm will be crucial to the outcome of brexit boris is likely to be tough with the eu and threatens a no deal brexit on 31st october without a revised agreement maybot is a remainer and has thus avoided a no deal exit boris is a brexiteer and will not be so easy with the eu the eu is adamant at present that no further negotiation will be allowed so we have an ongoing stand off and impasse the eu parliament voting completed this week and as predicted the brexit party came out on top with 29 seats out of a possible 73 and is the largest national party in the parliament the tory party and labour were humiliated and are re grouping the next test for the brexit party will be the peterborough by election due on 6th june which should give an indication of how far they can go towards a general election at some time in the future now that the eu voting results are known it might be worthwhile reminding ourselves of the history of the uk and eu membership how it came about with connivance from the ruling elite in the form of the uk deep state chapter 6 decades ago the british deep state hatched a nefarious plot against the british people the elite wanted to foist european unity on an unwilling populace the notion of the conceited whitehall elite was that the peasants were stupid and the mandarins knew best and it is going on even today as the remainers attempt every device to thwart brexit read on i can only describe the current situation by another s good words brexit keeps getting uglier week in particular and it is tearing britain apart as it has already torn prime minister theresa may apart who was forced to resign in tears and sobs friday or get ripped out by her roots she staked her administration entirely on an endlessly failing attempt to create a brexit without an exit her government collapsed in pieces around her over the week because her charade failed when her final attempt at getting a deal was shredded her latest and most significant defector leader of the house of commons andrea leadsom brought may s house down by writing in her resignation thursday i do not believe we will be a truly sovereign united kingdom through the deal that is now proposed a second referendum would be dangerously divisive undermining our union there has been such a breakdown of government processes a complete breakdown of government t responsibility read on details of parliament s deliberations can be found here there are no records for this week as parliament is in recess until next week chapter 10 national economies the budget should be balanced the treasury should be refilled public debt should be reduced the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled and the assistance to foreign lands should be curtailed lest rome will become bankrupt people must again learn to work instead of living on public assistance cicero 55 bce the imf s currency delineated in special drawing rights sdr there is no doubt that a common global currency for international trade will add stability to an individual nation s trading ability but at the cost of revaluing their domestic currency in global currency units this process is already in place at the imf which uses special drawing rights sdr to account for each nation s contributions according to their membership status the sdr values each nation s domestic currency against a basket of major currencies such that a standard measure of the value of each individual currency is obtained it is possible that the sdr system could form the basis of a global currency but there are many obstacles to be overcome before this will emerge as a solution to the current unstable financial environment the plan is to introduce a basket currency system as an alternative to the dollar as a world reserve currency then slowly but surely phase out all sovereign currencies until the basket becomes a currency itself the only currency former world bank chief economist justin yifu lin seems to agree with this ideology arguing that national currencies must be replaced with a supranational currency and pointing out that no single currency has the strength to stand alone as a world reserve currency i think the dominance of the greenback is the root cause of global financial and economic crises the solution to this is to replace the national currency with a global currency note displayed at the end of this book part 1 from the economist in 1988 a phoenix arises from the ashes of a calamity reborn what ashes are the elites expecting the new global currency to arise from it is also important to realise that the economist is not just any random financial publication it is in large part owned by the rothschild banking family and is based in the city of london financial centre the economist does not have to guess on the economic developments of the future it does have valid insights on what might be planned for a globalist future the fed and others are using qe in an attempt stimulate the economy the ten year period from the financial crisis in 2008 to 2018 9 has seen the federal reserve and other central banks continue to stimulate their economies with quantitative easing qe measures combined with the lowest interest rates in modern times the main objective is to combat the deflationary effects of the crisis and stimulate growth in the us economy enough to return world trade to its previous steady growth pattern the qe process should not continue forever although some would say that an orderly withdrawal is not going to be easy and compatible with the stability of markets even a slight hint of tapering of money printing by the fed in july 2013 was met with market shocks and rising interest rates indicating how fragile the current markets are to any reduction in qe nevertheless the growing mountain of bond issuance must be deployed and is distorting the operation of markets in general causing growing asset bubbles around the world stock and debt markets are priced well above what national economies can bear under the present poor economic conditions these bubbles tend to deflate suddenly and precipitate a crisis as we witnessed in 2008 this is the risk that financial and political elites recognise and are working to find solutions which will be compatible with price and market stability as usual america must lead the way because its economy represents 25 of global trade and the dollar is the major reserve currency used by over 60 of all parties to trade around the world it is not an exaggeration to view the federal reserve with assets of 3 5 trillion and falling acting as the world s largest financial intermediary the fed have been buying long term obligations and financing short term ones using its unique privilege of issuing the world s reserve currency the beneficial effects of this process appear to be wearing off as piling on more debt is yielding less and less in economic returns and thus growth as well as increasing the risks of encouraging speculative distortions and inflationary potentials this has given rise to a debate within the federal reserve board itself qe is very much a unique experiment the outcomes of which economists are unable to predict although their economic models appear to be indicating the need for some serious adjustment the simple truth is that banks have remained technically insolvent since 2008 and it is in this area that solutions must be found if the world is to return to a more stable economic base we know that trade relies on efficient banking and financial systems but as long as doubt remains of the eventual systemic default on commercial debts there can be no lasting stability within world markets nation states are impotent in the onslaught of globalisation it has become clear that the nation states alone even the usa are powerless to manage such a complex global financial system dependent as it is on multinational banks and corporations operating beyond national borders and local regulation banks in conjunction with central banks have become a law unto themselves as so well illustrated by recent exposures of criminal fraud going unpunished it appears that national boundaries are no barrier in a truly global financial system where market forces remain in charge and risks continually intensify until a sudden event triggers a dislocation of normal trade as happened in 2008 nothing has changed since then to minimise a reoccurrence of such a crisis and it is only a matter of time before the next catastrophe occurs on a global scale these national economies are the last pieces of the global financial jigsaw which completes a final picture of a world in turmoil both political and economic but it doesn t end here because the greatest influence on the ability of states to maintain stable economies is to do with the levels of economic risk which individual states will now bear the next chapters look at macroeconomics and economic growth in order to gain a rounded understanding of the jigsaw and what may be coming to all of us in the future part 2 of this book will look at how a new evolving world economic system affects individuals and how they can organise their affairs in such a way as to minimise the negative effects and take advantage of the many opportunities which inevitably will arise during times of global instability a free pdf of the introduction to part 2 is available by request to to be continued next saturday click to visit the tbp

the u s china trade war has entered a dangerous new phase tariffs are up and there s the threat of more to come a quick fix is still possible with presidents donald trump and xi jinping set to meet at the g 20 summit next month but at this point it looks more likely that the trade war will be long messy and expensive bloomberg economists dan hanson and tom orlik have mapped out the main scenarios their headline conclusion if tariffs expand to cover all u s china trade and markets slump in response global gdp will take a 600 billion hit in 2021 the year of peak impact on may 10 the u s took tariff rates on 250 billion of chinese exports to 25 retaliation was swift with china raising tariffs on certain u s goods in a range from 5 to 25 two years out bloomberg economics modelling suggests that output in china and u s would be lower by 0 5 and 0 2 respectively relative to a no trade war scenario global output would also come down a notch scenario 1 current tariff levels percent impact on quarterly gross domestic product china china u s u s world what about if tariffs increase the u s has threatened 25 tariffs on all chinese imports if a quick deal can t be achieved such a move would surely be answered if you want to talk the door is open if you want to fight we ll fight to the end said a chinese tv anchor capturing the mood in beijing plugging in 25 tariffs on all bilateral trade the model shows output declines of 0 8 0 5 and 0 5 for china the u s and the world in mid 2021 scenario 2 escalation to 25 tariffs on all bilateral trade percent impact on quarterly gross domestic product china china u s u s world financial markets are already wobbling with each new trade war headline and china s stock market in particular has seen a spate of sharp daily moves even so equities in both china and the u s are up on the year suggesting investors are still betting a deal will be done if they re wrong and heavyweights like apple get slapped with tariffs that raises the possibility of a sharp correction hanson and orlik s nightmare scenario adds a 10 equity market drop to the across the board 25 tariffs in that case china u s and world gdp would be 0 9 0 7 and 0 6 lower in mid 2021 in this situation the equity market drop acts as a further headwind to consumption and investment compounding the impact scenario 3 tariff escalation plus equity market shock percent impact on quarterly gross domestic product china china u s u s world the fallout from any of these scenarios would spread well beyond the u s and china the world s two biggest economies bloomberg

this article is excerpted from my new book banking on the people democratizing money in the digital age available in paperback june 1 the u s federal debt has more than doubled since the 2008 financial crisis shooting up from 9 4 trillion in mid 2008 to over 22 trillion in april 2019 the debt is never paid off the government just keeps paying the interest on it and interest rates are rising in 2018 the fed announced plans to raise rates by 2020 to normal levels a fed funds target of 3 375 percent and to sell about 1 5 trillion in federal securities at the rate of 50 billion monthly further growing the mountain of federal debt on the market when the fed holds government securities it returns the interest to the government after deducting its costs but the private buyers of these securities will be pocketing the interest adding to the taxpayers bill in fact it is the interest not the debt itself that is the problem with a burgeoning federal debt the principal just gets rolled over from year to year but the interest must be paid to private bondholders annually by the taxpayers and constitutes one of the biggest items in the federal budget currently the fed s plans for quantitative tightening are on hold but assuming it follows through with them projections are that by 2027 u s taxpayers will owe 1 trillion annually just in interest on the federal debt that is enough to fund president donald trump s trillion dollar infrastructure plan every year and it is a direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy investors holding most of the bonds where will this money come from crippling taxes wholesale privatization of public assets and elimination of social services will not be sufficient to cover the bill bondholder debt is unnecessary the irony is that the united states does not need to carry a debt to bondholders at all it has been financially sovereign ever since president franklin d roosevelt took the dollar off the gold standard domestically in 1933 this was recognized by beardsley ruml chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york in a 1945 presentation before the american bar association titled taxes for revenue are obsolete the necessity for government to tax in order to maintain both its independence and its solvency is true for state and local governments he said but it is not true for a national government the government was now at liberty to spend as needed to meet its budget drawing on credit issued by its own central bank it could do this until price inflation indicated a weakened purchasing power of the currency then and only then would the government need to levy taxes not to fund the budget but to counteract inflation by contracting the money supply the principal purpose of taxes said ruml was the maintenance of a dollar which has stable purchasing power over the years sometimes this purpose is stated as the avoidance of inflation the government could be funded without taxes by drawing on credit from its own central bank and since there was no longer a need for gold to cover the loan the central bank would not have to borrow it could just create the money on its books this insight is a basic tenet of modern monetary theory the government does not need to borrow or tax at least until prices are driven up it can just create the money it needs the government could create money by issuing it directly or by borrowing it directly from the central bank which would create the money on its books or by taking a perpetual overdraft on the treasury s account at the central bank which would have the same effect the power revolution transferring the money power to the banks the treasury could do that in theory but some laws would need to be changed currently the federal government is not allowed to borrow directly from the fed and is required to have the money in its account before spending it after the dollar went off the gold standard in 1933 congress could have had the fed just print money and lend it to the government cutting the banks out but wall street lobbied for an amendment to the federal reserve act forbidding the fed to buy bonds directly from the treasury as it had done in the past the treasury can borrow from itself by transferring money from intragovernmental accounts social security and other trust funds that are under the auspices of the treasury and have a surplus but these funds do not include the federal reserve which can lend to the government only by buying federal securities from bond dealers the fed is considered independent of the government its website states the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities are categorized as held by the public because they are not in government accounts according to marriner eccles chairman of the federal reserve from 1934 to 1948 the prohibition against allowing the government to borrow directly from its own central bank was written into the banking act of 1935 at the behest of those bond dealers that have an exclusive right to purchase directly from the fed a historical review on the website of the new york federal reserve quotes eccles as stating i think the real reasons for writing the prohibition into the can be traced to certain government bond dealers who quite naturally had their eyes on business that might be lost to them if direct purchasing were permitted the government was required to sell bonds through wall street middlemen which the fed could buy only through open market operations purchases on the private bond market open market operations are conducted by the federal open market committee fomc which meets behind closed doors and is dominated by private banker interests the fomc has no obligation to buy the government s debt and generally does so only when it serves the purposes of the fed and the banks rep wright patman chairman of the house committee on banking and currency from 1963 to 1975 called the official sanctioning of the federal open market committee in the banking laws of 1933 and 1935 the power revolution the transfer of the money power to the banks patman said the open market is in reality a tightly closed market only a selected few bond dealers were entitled to bid on the bonds the treasury made available for auction each week the practical effect he said was to take money from the taxpayer and give it to these dealers feeding off the real economy that massive wall street subsidy was the subject of testimony by eccles to the house committee on banking and currency on march 3 5 1947 patman asked eccles now since 1935 in order for the federal reserve banks to buy government bonds they had to go through a middleman is that correct eccles replied in the affirmative patman then launched into a prophetic warning stating i am opposed to the united states government which possesses the sovereign and exclusive privilege of creating money paying private bankers for the use of its own money i insist it is absolutely wrong for this committee to permit this condition to continue and saddle the taxpayers of this nation with a burden of debt that they will not be able to liquidate in a hundred years or two hundred years the truth of that statement is painfully evident today when we have a 22 trillion debt that cannot possibly be repaid the government just keeps rolling it over and paying the interest to banks and bondholders feeding the financialized economy in which money makes money without producing new goods and services the financialized economy has become a parasite feeding off the real economy driving producers and workers further and further into debt in the 1960s patman attempted to have the fed nationalized the effort failed but his committee did succeed in forcing the central bank to return its profits to the treasury after deducting its costs the prohibition against direct lending by the central bank to the government however remains in force the money power is still with the fomc and the banks a model we can no longer afford today the debt growth model has reached its limits as even the bank for international settlements the central bankers bank in switzerland acknowledges in its june 2016 annual report the bis said that debt levels were too high productivity growth was too low and the room for policy maneuver was too narrow the global economy cannot afford to rely any longer on the debt fueled growth model that has brought it to the current juncture the bis warned but the solutions it proposed would continue the austerity policies long imposed on countries that cannot pay their debts it prescribed prudential fiscal and above all structural policies structural readjustment that means privatizing public assets slashing services and raising taxes choking off the very productivity needed to pay the nations debts that approach has repeatedly been tried and has failed as witnessed for example in the devastated economy of greece meanwhile according to minneapolis fed president neel kashkari financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government bailout only modestly from 84 percent to 67 percent that means there is still a 67 percent chance of another major systemwide crisis and this one could be worse than the last the biggest banks are bigger local banks are fewer and global debt levels are higher the economy has farther to fall the regulators models are obsolete aimed at a form of old fashioned banking that has long since been abandoned we need a new model one designed to serve the needs of the public and the economy rather than to maximize shareholder profits at public expense an earlier version of this article was published in truthout org
if the democrats promote pro corporate trade policies in 2020 get ready for four more years of donald trump gloating at us all from 1600 pennsylvania avenue patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education roads rivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers president thomas jefferson 1806 state of the union message to congress how could democrats guarantee a second trump term come out in favor of so called free trade when walter mondale was nominated by the democratic party to take on ronald reagan in 1984 he uttered in his acceptance speech a single line that did more than anything else that year to lose him the election he said mr reagan will raise taxes and so will i he won t tell you i just did the republicans turned it into a campaign ad and it played over and again dragging mondale so far down that he lost every state in the country except his home state of minnesota what mondale said was true and reagan did raise taxes on working people eleven times but that was still the moment when mondale signed his own political death warrant americans had been bitten badly in the previous decade by inflation and the reagan recession and were in no mood to give more of their hard earned money to the government or anybody else in 2020 trade will be as potent an issue as taxes were in 1984 this election cycle it s starting to look like democrats are about to make the same mistake of not defending the paychecks of working people only this time the democratic quote will be trump won t succeed in bringing home your jobs but neither will i because i support all of the trade agreements that took your jobs in the first place instead the democratic party must return to its pre 1992 progressive protectionist union roots and steal this issue right out of trump s mouth saying that he s not protecting american workers jobs well enough or fast enough they should run hard in 2020 on the progressive caucus s long held position that we use protectionist policies including tariffs to end our trade deficits and bring back home our jobs the disastrous trade deficits we ve been running since the reagan era are damaging to the future of america for a variety of reasons from national security to where the profits from american companies end up to the flattening of american working wages and benefits trump pointed this out in 2016 and as egberto willies points out at dailykos it s a large part of why he s in the white house right now this was not how the founders intended it and it s not how working americans want it yes tariffs will initially raise the price of foreign manufactured goods and that will make it viable for american manufacturers to start up new factories as more manufacturing jobs come to the united states wages will rise american workers know this while nobody wants to pay more for a toaster or a refrigerator with good manufacturing jobs people will have larger paychecks american workers know this too in 1981 in a bow to their wall street and transnational corporate patrons republicans embraced free trade rejecting traditional american protectionist trade policies through the 1980s reagan and george h w bush negotiated nafta and helped kick start the wto while democrats warned us of what was coming the simple fact is that we no longer in any meaningful way make computers or tvs or clothes or power tools or toys or pretty much anything in the usa except military hardware guns processed food and fracked gas tragically in 1992 a new but growing part of the democratic party the democratic leadership council or dlc joined reagan bush when bill clinton said he was going to push and sign reagan s trade deals in that act the democratic party turned their backs on the two centuries of american trade policy that had turned us into the industrial powerhouse of the world beginning the great decline of working people here and american workers know it no matter how much centrist democratic politicians try to ignore it the simple fact is that we no longer in any meaningful way make computers or tvs or clothes or power tools or toys or pretty much anything in the usa except military hardware guns processed food and fracked gas thus when we stimulate our economy by putting money into the pockets of working people they go to walmart and buy things made in asia creating jobs in that part of the world and leaving our wealth in china and american workers know it regardless of the pundits on tv free trade rather than fair trade is a guaranteed ticket to the poorhouse for any fully developed nation and the evidence is overwhelming king henry vii in fact introduced the concept of free trade as something that england should encourage other countries to do while it maintained protectionism as john f kennedy told the nation in his october 13 1960 debate with richard nixon we have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume from abroad if we re going to be able to meet our obligations but the wall street democrats continued to push reagan s policies from the election of 1992 right up to and through the election of 2016 it s been an electoral disaster for example in july 2009 with no evident irony or apparent understanding of how south korea went about becoming a modern economic powerhouse president obama lectured the countries of africa during his visit to ghana as the new york times reported mr obama said that when his father came to the united states his home country of kenya had an economy as large as that of south korea per capita today he noted kenya remains impoverished and politically unstable while south korea has become an economic powerhouse in the same day s newspaper the lead editorial titled tangled trade talks repeated the essence of the mantra of its confused op ed writer thomas l friedman that so called free trade is the solution to a nation s economic ills there are few things that could do more damage to the already battered global economy than an old fashioned trade war the times opined so we have been increasingly worried by the protectionist rhetoric and policies being espoused by politicians across the globe and in this country but south korea did not ride the free trade train to success no country ever has in fact south korean economist ha joon chang details south korea s economic ascent in his brilliant 2008 book bad samaritans the myth of free trade and the secret history of capitalism in 1961 south korea was as obama said as poor as kenya with an 82 per capita annual income and many obstacles to economic strength the country s main exports were primary commodities such as fish and human hair for wigs that s how the korean technology giant samsung started by exporting fish fruits and vegetables today it s one of the world s largest conglomerates by revenue and market capitalization 254 billion in 2017 by throwing out free trade and embracing protectionism during the 1960s south korea managed to do in 50 years what it took the united states 100 years and britain 150 years to do after a military coup in 1961 general park chung hee implemented short term plans for south korea s economic development he instituted the heavy and chemical industrialization program and south korea s first steel mill and modern shipyard went into production in addition south korea began producing its own cars and used import tariffs to discourage imports electronics machinery and chemicals plants soon followed all sponsored or subsidized and tariff protected by the government between 1972 and 1979 the per capita income grew over five times then south korean citizens adopted new protectionist slogans for example it was viewed as civic duty to publicly shame anyone caught smoking foreign cigarettes all money made from exports went into developing industry south korea enacted import bans high tariffs and excise taxes on thousands of products by the 80s south korea was still far from the industrialized west but it had built a solid middle class south korea s transformation was to quote chang as if haiti had turned into switzerland this transformation was accomplished through protecting fledgling industries with high tariffs and subsidies and only gradually opening itself to global completion in addition the government ran or heavily funded many of the larger industries at least until they were globally competitive the government ran or regulated the banks and therefore the credit it controlled foreign exchange and used its currency reserves to import machinery and industrial imports at the same time the government tightly controlled foreign investment in south korea and largely ignored enforcement of foreign patent laws korea focused on exporting basic goods to fuel and protect its high tech industries with tariffs and subsidies had south korea adopted the free trade policies espoused by friedman bill clinton and the new york times it would still be exporting fish and be just as poor per capita as kenya while american voters may not know the details of south korea s rise they understand the principles no matter what the pundits say on tv another favorite friedman free trade example is the success of toyota s lexus luxury car immortalized in his book the lexus and the olive tree but again the reality is quite different than what friedman naively portrays in his book in fact japan subsidized toyota not only in its development but even after it failed terribly in the american markets in the late 1950s in addition early in toyota s development japan kicked out foreign competitors like gm thus because the japanese government financed toyota at a loss for roughly 20 years built high tariff and other barriers to competitive imports and subsidized exports auto manufacturing was able to get a strong foothold and we now think of japanese exports being synonymous with automobiles for about 200 years we understood well the benefits of tariffs subsidized exports and protectionist policies in the united states and american working people still understand them every president from george washington to jimmy carter aggressively used tariffs and regulated foreign investment every president prior to reagan considered free trade particularly in which every other country maintains vat taxes to protect their domestic economies but we don t to be absurd and worked instead for fair trade trade that would benefit america and american workers in his 1978 state of the union address for example president carter said by working closely with our friends abroad we can promote the economic health of the whole world with fair and balanced agreements lowering the barriers to trade despite the inevitable pressures that build up when the world economy suffers from high unemployment we must firmly resist the demands for self defeating protectionism but free trade must also be fair trade and i am determined to protect american industry and american workers against foreign trade practices which are unfair or illegal three years later when ronald reagan came into office as the result of 190 years of alexander hamilton s plan the united states was the world s largest importer of raw materials the world s largest exporter of finished manufactured goods and the world s largest creditor we bought iron ore from other countries and manufactured it into tvs and washing machines here that we then exported to the rest of the world and when countries couldn t afford to buy our manufactured goods we loaned them the money because of reagan clinton s neoliberal free trade we ve completely flipped that upside down we re now the world s largest exporter of raw materials the world s largest importer of finished goods and the world s largest debtor we now export raw materials to china and buy from them manufactured goods and we borrow from them 1 2 trillion as of this moment to do it this by the way is the virtual definition of a third world country democrats need to re embrace hamilton s principles as put into practice in 1793 and largely kept in place until 1993 when clinton signed the nafta agreement that had been negotiated by reagan and bush the congressional progressive caucus knows how to do this and donald trump sure knows the politics of it it s pretty straightforward notwithstanding all the chatter from new democrat democrats and the talking heads on cable news returning to the governing principles the democratic party has held since its creation by thomas jefferson in the 1790s is a bold move no doubt for any president or party to make but they re largely the policies that progressive democrats like ohio s senator sherrod brown have been running and winning on for generations tariffs built america they paid the largest share of the cost of the federal governmentfrom the founding of the republic until the civil war two thirds of the federal budget until world war i and about a third at the time of world war ii thus jefferson noted how tariffs were producing surpluses for the united states tariffs paid for 90 percent of his 1806 budget in his 1806 state of the union message to congress the question therefore now comes forward jefferson said to what other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated and the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures he answered his own rhetorical question a few sentences later pointing out that americans wouldn t want the government to drop the tariffs instead he noted their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education roads rivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers progressive democrats have been pushing for a return to jefferson until carter protectionist policies ever since bill clinton split apart the party over the issue with his advocacy of nafta in the 1992 election if the democrats want to beat trump they need to get with the progressives trade program in a big strong and fast way democrats must point out that trump is doing protectionism wrong because he s doing his tariffs by executive order which only last as long as his administration does no company is going to build a factory based on that thin assurance and the anti tariff republican party will never pass such a policy trump is screwed in that regard congress should be negotiating our trade agreements in the open and passing them as solid long lasting legislation so companies have multi decade horizons of tariff protections democrats need to return the party to its past mission of putting american workers and the environment first but if the democrats promote free trade in 2020 get ready for four more years of donald trump gloating at us all from 1600 pennsylvania avenue i m for free trade if it becomes the party s mantra will be the 2020 version of mondale s i m going to raise your taxes this article was produced by

else that year to lose him the election he said mr reagan will raise taxes and so will i he won t tell you i just did the republicans turned it into a campaign ad and it played over and again dragging mondale so far down that he lost every state in the country except his home state of minnesota what mondale said was true and reagan did raise taxes on working people eleven times but that was still the moment when mondale signed his own political death warrant americans had been bitten badly in the previous decade by inflation and the reagan recession and were in no mood to give more of their hard earned money to the government or anybody else in 2020 trade will be as potent an issue as taxes were in 1984 this election cycle it s starting to look like democrats are about to make the same mistake of not defending the paychecks of working people only this time the democratic quote will be trump won t succeed in bringing home your jobs but neither will i because i support all of the trade agreements that took your jobs in the first place instead the democratic party must return to its pre 1992 progressive protectionist union roots and steal this issue right out of trump s mouth saying that he s not protecting american workers jobs well enough or fast enough they should run hard in 2020 on the progressive caucus s long held position that we use protectionist policies including tariffs to end our trade deficits and bring back home our jobs the disastrous trade deficits we ve been running since the reagan era are damaging to the future of america for a variety of reasons from national security to where the profits from american companies end up to the flattening of american working wages and benefits trump pointed this out in 2016 and as egberto willies points out at dailykos it s a large part of why he s in the white house right now this was not how the founders intended it and it s not how working americans want it yes tariffs will initially raise the price of foreign manufactured goods and that will make it viable for american manufacturers to start up new factories as more manufacturing jobs come to the united states wages will rise american workers know this while nobody wants to pay more for a toaster or a refrigerator with good manufacturing jobs people will have larger paychecks american workers know this too in 1981 in a bow to their wall street and transnational corporate patrons republicans embraced free trade rejecting traditional american protectionist trade policies through the 1980s reagan and george h w bush negotiated nafta and helped kick start the wtowhile democrats warned us of what was coming tragically in 1992 a new but growing part of the democratic party the democratic leadership council or dlc joined reagan bush when bill clinton said he was going to push and sign reagan s trade deals in that act the democratic party turned their backs on the two centuries of american trade policy that had turned us into the industrial powerhouse of the world beginning the great decline of working people here and american workers know it no matter how much centrist democratic politicians try to ignore it the simple fact is that we no longer in any meaningful way make computers or tvs or clothes or power tools or toys or pretty much anything in the usa except military hardware guns processed food and fracked gas thus when we stimulate our economy by putting money into the pockets of working people they go to walmart and buy things made in asia creating jobs in that part of the world and leaving our wealth in china and american workers know it regardless of the pundits on tv free trade rather than fair trade is a guaranteed ticket to the poorhouse for any fully developed nation and the evidence is overwhelming king henry vii in fact introduced the concept of free trade as something that england should encourage other countries to do while it maintained protectionism as john f kennedy told the nation in his october 13 1960 debate with richard nixon we have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume from abroad if we re going to be able to meet our obligations but the wall street democrats continued to push reagan s policies from the election of 1992 right up to and through the election of 2016 it s been an electoral disaster for example in july 2009 with no evident irony or apparent understanding of how south korea went about becoming a modern economic powerhouse president obama lectured the countries of africa during his visit to ghana as the new york times reported mr obama said that when his father came to the united states his home country of kenya had an economy as large as that of south korea per capita today he noted kenya remains impoverished and politically unstable while south korea has become an economic powerhouse in the same day s newspaper the lead editorial titled tangled trade talks repeated the essence of the mantra of its confused op ed writer thomas l friedman that so called free trade is the solution to a nation s economic ills there are few things that could do more damage to the already battered global economy than an old fashioned trade war the times opined so we have been increasingly worried by the protectionist rhetoric and policies being espoused by politicians across the globe and in this country but south korea did not ride the free trade train to success no country ever has in fact south korean economist ha joon chang details south korea s economic ascent in his brilliant 2008 book bad samaritans the myth of free trade and the secret history of capitalism in 1961 south korea was as obama said as poor as kenya with an 82 per capita annual income and many obstacles to economic strength the country s main exports were primary commodities such as fish and human hair for wigs that s how the korean technology giant samsung started by exporting fish fruits and vegetables today it s one of the world s largest conglomerates by revenue and market capitalization 254 billion in 2017 by throwing out free trade and embracing protectionism during the 1960s south korea managed to do in 50 years what it took the united states 100 years and britain 150 years to do after a military coup in 1961 general park chung hee implemented short term plans for south korea s economic development he instituted the heavy and chemical industrialization program and south korea s first steel mill and modern shipyard went into production in addition south korea began producing its own cars and used import tariffs to discourage imports electronics machinery and chemicals plants soon followed all sponsored or subsidized and tariff protected by the government between 1972 and 1979 the per capita income grew over five times then south korean citizens adopted new protectionist slogans for example it was viewed as civic duty to publicly shame anyone caught smoking foreign cigarettes all money made from exports went into developing industry south korea enacted import bans high tariffs and excise taxes on thousands of products by the 80s south korea was still far from the industrialized west but it had built a solid middle class south korea s transformation was to quote chang as if haiti had turned into switzerland this transformation was accomplished through protecting fledgling industries with high tariffs and subsidies and only gradually opening itself to global completion in addition the government ran or heavily funded many of the larger industries at least until they were globally competitive the government ran or regulated the banks and therefore the credit it controlled foreign exchange and used its currency reserves to import machinery and industrial imports at the same time the government tightly controlled foreign investment in south korea and largely ignored enforcement of foreign patent laws korea focused on exporting basic goods to fuel and protect its high tech industries with tariffs and subsidies had south korea adopted the free trade policies espoused by friedman bill clinton and the new york times it would still be exporting fish and be just as poor per capita as kenya while american voters may not know the details of south korea s rise they understand the principles no matter what the pundits say on tv another favorite friedman free trade example is the success of toyota s lexus luxury car immortalized in his book the lexus and the olive tree but again the reality is quite different than what friedman naively portrays in his book in fact japan subsidized toyota not only in its development but even after it failed terribly in the american markets in the late 1950s in addition early in toyota s development japan kicked out foreign competitors like gm thus because the japanese government financed toyota at a loss for roughly 20 years built high tariff and other barriers to competitive imports and subsidized exports auto manufacturing was able to get a strong foothold and we now think of japanese exports being synonymous with automobiles for about 200 years we understood well the benefits of tariffs subsidized exports and protectionist policies in the united states and american working people still understand them every president from george washington to jimmy carter aggressively used tariffs and regulated foreign investment every president prior to reagan considered free trade particularly in which every other country maintains vat taxes to protect their domestic economies but we don t to be absurd and worked instead for fair trade trade that would benefit america and american workers in his 1978 state of the union address for example president carter said by working closely with our friends abroad we can promote the economic health of the whole world with fair and balanced agreements lowering the barriers to trade despite the inevitable pressures that build up when the world economy suffers from high unemployment we must firmly resist the demands for self defeating protectionism but free trade must also be fair trade and i am determined to protect american industry and american workers against foreign trade practices which are unfair or illegal three years later when ronald reagan came into office as the result of 190 years of alexander hamilton s plan the united states was the world s largest importer of raw materials the world s largest exporter of finished manufactured goods and the world s largest creditor we bought iron ore from other countries and manufactured it into tvs and washing machines here that we then exported to the rest of the world and when countries couldn t afford to buy our manufactured goods we loaned them the money because of reagan clinton s neoliberal free trade we ve completely flipped that upside down we re now the world s largest exporter of raw materials the world s largest importer of finished goods and the world s largest debtor we now export raw materials to china and buy from them manufactured goods and we borrow from them 1 2 trillion as of this moment to do it this by the way is the virtual definition of a third world country democrats need to re embrace hamilton s principles as put into practice in 1793 and largely kept in place until 1993 when clinton signed the nafta agreement that had been negotiated by reagan and bush the congressional progressive caucusknows how to do this and donald trump sure knows the politics of it it s pretty straightforward notwithstanding all the chatter from new democrat democrats and the talking heads on cable news returning to the governing principles the democratic party has held since its creation by thomas jefferson in the 1790s is a bold move no doubt for any president or party to make but they re largely the policies that progressive democrats like ohio s senator sherrod brown have been running and winning on for generations tariffs built america they paid the largest share of the cost of the federal government from the founding of the republic until the civil war two thirds of the federal budget until world war i and about a third at the time of world war ii thus jefferson noted how tariffs were producing surpluses for the united states tariffs paid for 90percent of his 1806budget in his 1806 state of the union message to congress the question therefore now comes forward jefferson said to what other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated and the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures he answered his own rhetorical question a few sentences later pointing out that americans wouldn t want the government to drop the tariffs instead he noted their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education roads rivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers progressive democrats have been pushing for a return to jefferson until carter protectionist policies ever since bill clinton split apart the party over the issue with his advocacy of nafta in the 1992 election if the democrats want to beat trump they need to get with the progressives trade program in a big strong and fast way democrats must point out that trump is doing protectionism wrong because he s doing his tariffs by executive order which only last as long as his administration does no company is going to build a factory based on that thin assurance and the anti tariff republican party will never pass such a policy trump is screwed in that regard congress should be negotiating our trade agreements in the open and passing them as solid long lasting legislation so companies have multi decade horizons of tariff protections democrats need to return the party to its past mission of putting american workers and the environment first but if the democrats promote free trade in 2020 get ready for four more years of donald trump gloating at us all from 1600 pennsylvania avenue i m for free trade if it becomes the party s mantra will be the 2020 version of mondale s i m going to raise your taxes
the losses came in spite of the eur managing to recover from a thursday intraweek low 1 1116 out of the u s on the data front key stats were skewed to the negative in the week following memorial day on monday may consumer confidence figures provide direction on tuesday the cb consumer confidence index continued its upward trajectory rising from 129 2 to 134 1 the move back to close to 18 year

month the cac40 ended may with a 6 78 loss yet more disappointing economic data and trade war jitters weighed on the european majors in the week elsewhere it was a mixed week for the aussie and kiwi

delivered mixed results in the week while business confidence saw a marginal improvement in may building consents tumbled for a 2nd month in a row adding to the negative bias was the rbnz s financial

the yen a 2 81 gain out of china may nbs private sector pmi figures added to the risk aversion in the week the government numbers showed that the manufacturing sector contracted in may steady output from the services sector eased some of the pain
risk aversion ran wild as stock markets and other risk assets plummeted on global tariff escalation the us dollar s early gains during the end of may market rout is starting to reverse course on expectations the fed may cut rates twice this year stocks are licking their wounds following a double dose of negative trade news the first bullet came from china s retaliatory measures that will deliver a crippling blow to multi nationals and likely further downgrade earnings forecasts as the sino us relationship appears to going towards a path of irreparable damage the second bullet came from the escalation in trade tensions between mexico and us which pretty much came out of nowhere the trade spat with china has been brewing but markets were taken back with the us actions towards mexico the us mexico and canada were in the process of getting the usmca approved with their respective governments but that may have hit a road block now president trump s attack to their southern neighbor saw a mexican response that us exports of grains pork and apples may be hit with tariffs tariff escalation is detrimental to global growth and the bond market saw bunds fall to a record low and the 10 year treasury yield dropped to a fresh 20 month low and fell further below the fed s fund target range markets will continue to care about every incremental trade update but they should also closely pay attention to a couple important rate decisions and a wrath of fed speak which includes chair powell s discussion on policy strategy on monday president trump will also make a state visit to the uk where he will meet with queen elizabeth and pm may tuesday the rba is expected to cut rates and we hear from fed chairman jerome powell at a fed research conference wednesday the eia releases their crude oil weekly report and the fed releases the beige book and members clarida and bostic speak on thursday the ecb will keep policy steady and update their economic forecasts friday will see pm may step down as the leader of the conservative party and have the release of the us employment report which expects to see hiring deliver 185 000 new jobs in may rba to cut rates and signal more are coming ecb to downgrade forecasts and give details on next round of tltros fed s speakers to address recent trade war escalation and possible capitulation on cuts rba on tuesday the reserve bank of australia rba is widely expected to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1 25 with investors focusing on how many more cuts will be queued up only 5 of economists two specifically see the rba keep rates steady at the last meeting the rba surprised many when they kept policy following disappointingly weak first quarter inflation the rba may decide on holding off on confirming any additional rate cuts preferring to see how the global growth slowdown hits their domestic economy the recent global bond rally took the australian 10 year yield below the rba s cash rate of 1 5 for the first time since 2015 analysts are piling on the rate cut bets jp morgan sees rates falling to 0 50 by mid 2020 while westpac and capital economics see cuts targeting 0 75 with tame inflation the rba s easing decision should be an easy one the australian dollar remains near the lows of the year as the recent escalation in trade wars dims global growth outlooks and while data points in the asia pacific continue to deteriorate with china s may manufacturing pmi falling back into contraction expectations remain high the pboc will come to the rescue while the market begins pricing in further rba rate cuts we could limited australian dollar downside as the greater driver could be the fed s capitulation with delivering their own rate cuts fed a wrath of federal reserve members will speak next week with investors waiting to see further confirming signals that the fed will provide further accommodation shortly on tuesday fed chair jerome powell will discuss monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices at the fed s framework review conference in chicago markets have not heard from powell since the trade war went on steroids and he could use this as his stage to begin capitulate and signal accommodation is needed the fed s preferred core price measure in april stayed steady at 1 6 but still comfortably below the fed s 2 target the us trade war escalations with china and mexico will likely dominate the fed s concerns here and while the data dependent script may suggest they need to see further data confirm weakness they might agree that is not necessary ecb the ecb rate decision is expected to see no change with rates and possibly minor downgrades with their economic forecasts the central bank will also deliver more details on the expected launch of its third round of targeted long term refinancing operations in september economists are expecting them to use tltros as a backstop which could provide insurance in times of heightened uncertainty with most of the other g7 central banks on the verge of providing stimulus expectations are rising for the ecb to also provide fresh support to the ailing economy global trade wars are raising the risk for a euro zone recession but that is still not the base case the current implied interest rate probabilities see a 53 chance that the ecb cuts rates at the january 23rd 2020 meeting the upcoming meeting should see the ecb provide a slight adjustment to forward guidance becoming more accommodative economists however still are not abandoning a rate hike in the near future and that should provide some support for the euro a reuters poll showed 47 of the 60 contributors expect a rate hike at some point between now and the end of 2020 while 3 saw a cut and the rest expect no change in rates the euro remains stuck in very tight range and we should see 1 11 remain formidable support while 1 1250 provides initial resistance oil the month of may was a disaster for crude prices the worst may performance in seven years as unabrupt escalation with global trade war saw the global growth outlook crumble oil prices have now given up the lion share of the effects of the opec production cuts geopolitical risks remain in place but right now demand growth is in freefall and oil remains vulnerable the us china trade war remains most critical to the global growth outlook but the addition of trade tensions between the us and mexico raised the slower demand picture for the americas west texas intermediate crude s selloff is now around 20 lower from the april 23rd high of 66 60 with rising expectations that opec will be less effective in signaling continued production cuts going forward crude will need to rely on some positive outcomes on the trade front for prices to begin stabilizing gold it took a while but gold prices finally broke out higher after the trade war escalation led to a code red for global growth a devastating month for equities the worst one since december and other risk assets saw a global bond rally lead the way for safe haven assets the yellow metal is once again becoming an attractive safe haven as markets will remain skeptical on any

since it began operations in 2010 uber has grown to the point where it now collects over 45 billion in gross passenger revenue and it has seized a major share of the urban car service market but the widespread belief that it is a highly innovative and successful company has no basis in economic reality an examination of uber s economics suggests that it has no hope of ever earning sustainable urban car service profits in competitive markets its costs are simply much higher than the market is willing to pay as its nine years of massive losses indicate uber not only lacks powerful competitive advantages but it is actually less efficient than the competitors it has been driving out of business uber s investors however never expected that their returns would come from superior efficiency in competitive markets uber pursued a growth at all costs strategy financed by a staggering 20 billion in investor funding this funding subsidized fares and service levels that could not be matched by incumbents who had to cover costs out of actual passenger fares uber s massive subsidies were explicitly anticompetitive and are ultimately unsustainable but they made the company enormously popular with passengers who enjoyed not having to pay the full cost of their service the resulting rapid growth was also intended to make uber highly attractive to those segments of the investment world that believed explosive top line growth was the only important determinant of how start up companies should be valued investors focused narrow ly on uber s revenue growth and only rarely considered whether the company could ever produce the profits that might someday repay the multibillion dollar subsidies most public criticisms of uber have focused on narrow behavioral and cultural issues including deceptive advertising and pricing algorithmic manipulation driver exploitation deep seated misogyny among executives and disregard of laws and business norms such criticisms are valid but these problems are not fixable aberrations they were the inevitable result of pursuing growth at all costs without having any ability to fund that growth out of positive cash flow and while uber has taken steps to reduce negative publicity it has not done and cannot do anything that could suddenly pro duce a sustainable profitable business model uber s longer term goal was to eliminate all meaningful competition and then profit from this quasi monopoly power while it has already begun using some of this artificial power to suppress driver wages it has not achieved the facebook or amazon type plat form power it hoped to exploit given that both sustainable profits and true industry dominance seemed unachievable uber s investors de cided to take the company public based on the hope that enough gullible investors still believe that the compa ny s rapid growth and popularity are the result of powerfully effi cient inno vations and do not care about its inability to generate profits these beliefs about uber s corporate value were created entirely out of thin air this is not a case of a company with a reasonably sound operating business that has managed to inflate stock market expectations a bit this is a case of a massive valuation that has no relationship to any economic fundamentals uber has no competitive efficiency advantages operates in an industry with few barriers to entry and has lost more than 14 billion in the previous four years but its narratives convinced most people in the media invest ment and tech worlds that it is the most valuable transportation company on the planet and the second most valuable start up ipo in u s history after facebook uber is the breakthrough case where the public perception of a large new company was entirely created using the types of manufactured narratives typically employed in partisan political campaigns narrative construction is perhaps uber s greatest competitive strength the company used these techniques to completely divert attention away from the massive subsidies that were the actual drivers of its popularity and growth it successfully framed the entire public discussion around an emotive us versus them battle between heroic innovators and corrupt regulators who were falsely blamed for all of the industry s historic service problems uber s desired framing that it was fighting a moral battle on behalf of technological progress and economic freedom was uncritically ac cepted by the mainstream business and tech industry press who then never bothered to analyze the firm s actual economics or its anticompetitive behavior in reality uber s platform does not include any technological breakthroughs and uber has done nothing to disrupt the eco nomics of providing urban car services what uber has disrupted is the idea that competitive consumer and capital markets will maximize overall economic welfare by rewarding companies with superior efficiency its multibillion dollar subsidies completely distorted marketplace price and service signals leading to a massive misallocation of resources uber s most important innovation has been to produce staggering levels of private wealth without creating any sustainable benefits for consumers workers the cities they serve or anyone else uber cannot produce sustainable profits prior to its ipo uber publicly released limited p l results these showed gaap net losses of 2 6 billion in 2015 3 8 billion in 2016 4 5 billion in 2017 and 3 9 billion in 2018 1 in its april ipo s 1 prospectus uber recast all its historical p l results allegedly to isolate the terrible results in three major markets china russia and southeast asia that uber has abandoned from the results of its ongoing operations which are the primary concern of potential investors 2 but uber s s 1 included 5 billion roughly 3 billion in divestiture gains and 2 billion representing uber s valuation of its untradeable equity debt positions in the companies that took over its failed operations as part of net income from its ongoing operations this deliberate misstatement was designed to give potential investors the impression that the profitability of uber s current marketplace services had improved by 5 billion and that uber actually made a billion dollar net profit in 2018 if one correctly segregates ongoing and discontinued results however uber s actual 2018 profit improvement was zero its ongoing operations lost 3 5 billion in 2017 and lost 3 5 billion again in 2018 the company s losses over the last four years from still ongoing operations were roughly 14 billion 3 previously uber had been the only ridesharing company with sufficient public data to allow a detailed analysis of business model competitiveness versus incumbent operators but the march release of lyft s ipo prospectus revealed that it has the same terrible economics as uber 4 and there is no public evidence that any other ridesharing company such as didi grab ola and other large asian operators has a path to sustainable profitability like uber other well known start ups lost money at first but unlike uber they quickly generated the strong positive cash flow needed to fund growth the gross fares paid by uber passengers increased from 9 billion in 2015 to 45 billion in 2018 if uber had the powerful scale network economies that allowed start ups like amazon and google to rapidly grow into profitability the results would have shown up in uber s financial performance years ago in fact uber s operating and investing activities burned 2 2 billion in cash in 2018 its ninth year of operation uber s gaap profit margin was 135 percent in 2015 it appeared to improve to 51 percent in 2017 and adjusting for the divestiture and noncash equity gains discussed above 35 percent in 2018 yet these subsequent improvements were not driven by efficiency gains but by the ability to force driver take home pay down to minimum wage levels if uber drivers still received their 2015 share of each passenger dollar uber s negative margins would still be in the triple digits primarily digital companies benefit from very strong economies of scale because the marginal cost of expansion becomes negligible once basic corporate infrastructure is in place uber by contrast provides a transportation service with a very small percentage of fixed costs costs increase with each additional vehicle and driver and uber incurs huge start up costs with each new city and country it enters uber and taxi services in general realize none of the network economies that some other transport companies enjoy e g airline hub networks they also have none of the facebook type network effects following what is known as metcalfe s law by which each new user makes the network more valuable to all other users which makes it nearly impossible for smaller competitors to survive uber has higher costs than the competitors it has displaced if uber s growth had actually resulted from superior efficiency there would be ample evidence that it could provide taxi service at significantly lower costs than traditional operators the opposite is true uber has higher costs than traditional operators in every cate gory other than fuel the cost structure of any urban car service company has four components vehicle costs typically 18 percent of total including acquisition financing maintenance and licensing corporate costs 15 percent including dispatching advertising overhead functions such as it and legal and returns to shareholders fuel 9 percent and driver compensation 58 percent including benefits 5 uber s business model shifts the vehicle costs ownership maintenance insurance that traditional companies used to incur to its independent contractor drivers passenger fares need to cover total uber plus driver costs but shifting the burden of vehicle costs and financing onto drivers makes those costs higher since hundreds of thousands of drivers with limited capital and business experience cannot possibly manage these costs as well as even a typi cal traditional cab company traditional cab companies also have much lower corporate costs as they avoid uber s huge expenditures in areas like political lobbying global branding it development big corporate headquarters etc uber should also have higher driver costs than traditional opera tors because the huge increase in the demand for drivers should have improved wages benefits and working conditions as will be discussed below however uber initially offered incentives that in creased its driver costs but since 2015 has suppressed take home pay to minimum wage levels this exercise of artificial market power cannot be considered an uber efficiency or productivity advantage most of uber s margin improvements came from reducing driver take home pay while uber has not achieved the global industry dominance its investors were originally seeking its ability to reduce driver pay illustrates how it always intended to use market power as a major source of returns prior to uber s market entry the take home pay of big city taxi drivers was only 12 17 per hour and drivers needed to work 60 75 hours a week to earn that much despite extensively promoting how it would improve life for its driver partners uber actually re duced take home pay to 9 11 per hour below minimum wage levels in many cases 6 there have been multiple reports about drivers needing to sleep in their cars to make ends meet 7 a recent study of drivers for app based companies in new york city showed that 90 percent were recent immigrants largely from haiti the dominican republic pakistan india and bangladesh and 20 percent required public income supplements such as food stamps 8 uber s entry substantially increased the demand for drivers if labor markets worked as predicted by economic theory this should have significantly increased driver take home pay and improved working conditions instead uber exploited artificial market power to subvert normal market dynamics its extensive driver recruitment programs used gross dishonesty to deceive drivers including ongo ing misrepresentations of gross pay prior to deducting vehicle costs as net pay and at one point the company claimed that uber drivers in new york averaged 90 000 in annual earnings uber s shift of the full vehicle burden onto drivers created additional artificial power traditional cab drivers could easily move to other jobs if they were unhappy but uber s drivers were locked into vehicle fi nancial obligations that made it much more difficult to leave once they discovered how poor actual pay and conditions were starting in 2015 uber eliminated most of the incentives it had used to attract drivers and unilaterally raised its share of passenger fares from 20 percent to 25 30 percent almost all of uber s margin improvement since 2015 is explained by this reduction of driver compensation down to minimum wage levels not by improved efficiency these unilateral compensation cuts resulted in a direct wealth transfer from labor to capital of over 3 billion comparable cuts at lyft resulted in a labor capital wealth transfer of 1 billion 9 uber has not increased taxi productivity or solved long standing industry problems traditional taxi service was widely disliked in a perfect world customers want clean sparkling cabs and don t want to pay higher prices for the increased availability and reliability required to get cars to instantly appear whenever they want four major structural issues explain why traditional cab companies couldn t improve pro ductivity and couldn t economically provide the level of service customers would have liked these problems have long been under stood and are inherent to every form of urban transport solving these structural barriers would require significantly reducing operat ing costs and significantly increasing the productivity of vehicles and drivers uber however has failed to reduce car service costs and it hasn t meaningfully improved productivity far from revolutionizing the future of transportation uber has not solved any of the in dustry s long standing structural problems most taxi demand is low income higher fares would shrink traf fic and reduce utilization taxi demand is sociologically bipolar 55 percent of demand comes from people earning less than 40 000 per year while 35 percent comes from people earning more than 100 000 10 demand from lower income people is driven by access to jobs in areas or at times of day when transit service is poor or non existent given the current income distribution of riders any at tempt to balance supply and de mand will either drive lower in come passengers out of the market or result in wealthy customers being charged less than they might be willing to pay uber does not have the lower cost structure needed to improve service while keep ing fares low and apparently realizes that only a small portion of the market is willing to pay fares that would cover the true cost of its service higher prices would also reduce vehicle utilization and de stroy any notion that uber s busi ness has exceptional growth poten tial uneven geo graphic demand creates unavoidable empty backhaul costs taxi demand as with demand for every other form of urban transport has extreme temporal and geographic peaks most cities have a dense core area where taxi demand is highest and taxis operating within that zone can maintain reasonably high daily utili zation but the true cost of trips to neighborhoods outside that zone can be as much as twice normal trip costs since they will have an empty backhaul low income neighborhoods receive poor taxi ser vice because drivers rationally avoid trips where they won t find a return fare uber does nothing to create new demand that can fill those empty seats and has no way to vary fares based on backhaul utilization people expect that the fare to the airport should be roughly the same at 6 a m when the cab will return empty as at 4 p m when return fares are queued up extremely high cost of peak capacity peak taxi demand occurs during the late evening especially on friday and saturday nights as with rush hour transit and expressway peaks the cost of the capaci ty needed to serve peak demand is four to five times the cost of serving demand on tuesday morning cab companies cannot afford to provide all the expensive capacity demanded creating conflict as wealthier people headed to restaurants and clubs fight over the limited supply of cabs with late shift workers at hospitals and ware houses uber has done nothing to reduce the high cost of peak service or find paying passengers anxious to travel at off hours uber s core business proposition push a button get a car by definition requires far more capacity and much lower utilization rates than traditional operators overcapacity risk taxi businesses in unregulated markets have no natural barriers to entry and thus face the risk of ruinous over capacity that reduces utilization and precludes a workable balance of supply and demand as both uber and past cases of unlimited mar ket entry have demonstrated new entrants don t charge fares high enough to cover full operating costs ensuring major losses for everyone uber did not suddenly discover ways to dramatically improve productivity and service quality that everyone else in the industry had been too stupid to recognize for the past hundred years 11 in fact nothing in uber s business model solves any of the major problems that have long frustrated users uber s popularity is based on manufactured narratives customers correctly perceived that uber offered greater availability and reliability than traditional cab companies used to but failed to recognize that all of these improvements required billions of dollars in unsustainable subsidies if a new entrant in any other established industry suddenly offered much more service at much lower prices than incumbents ever had the normal response would be to demand evidence about the productivity breakthroughs making this possible uber could not withstand this scrutiny as it has no competitive efficiency advantages and no plausible way to explain how it might ever provide these services and prices profitably to divert attention from the subsidies that actually drove its popularity uber and its supporters put forward a variety of vague unsubstantiated and con stantly changing pr claims designed to mislead the public into thinking its popularity actually had something to do with powerful efficiency breakthroughs uber claimed that its business model was based on cutting edge technological innovations which would overwhelm incumbents in any market anywhere in reality uber s technology is less sophis ticated than what airlines and other industries have been using for decades although uber may have been an early adopter of smart phone app based cab hailing this service has been easily repli cated by other companies including traditional cab operators and uber has no significant advantage here more importantly there is no evidence that any of it creates meaningful efficiency gains or that similar technologies led to major competitive upheavals in any other industry uber s business model hasn t worked anywhere and it has failed disastrously in many markets that the company once claimed were strategically critical including china russia and southeast asia uber also claimed huge efficiency gains by offering flexible work ing conditions to people who want to be their own boss and while uber was able to take advantage of abysmal labor market conditions after the 2008 financial crisis the claim that many of its drivers were entrepreneurial millennials with a preference for gig work has always been totally inconsistent with how its business actually operates some drivers may have been initially attracted by uber s false claims about driver pay but near minimum wage work is not a lifestyle choice uber s driver rules and incentives ensure that most drivers work full time and no large scale transport service can survive if capacity only shows up when workers happen to feel like it above all uber argued that its business model and technology were so innovative that it had created an entirely new industry ridesharing based on entirely new business concepts the sharing economy it insisted that it was a tech company selling sophisticated software and could not possibly be compared to taxi companies in fact however uber carries people from point a to point b just like taxis have for a hundred years the tech company claim was really an attempt to get people to ignore its huge losses since tech companies like facebook had quickly grown into profitability the software claim was designed to justify preventing its drivers from getting the labor law protections employees are entitled to based on the argument that they were totally independent entrepreneurs who had freely chosen to purchase uber s superi or software products furthermore nothing in uber s business mod el is actually being shared the only meaningful economic dis tinction between taxis and ridesharing is that the latter avoids regulations that traditional taxis must still obey and depends on billions in predatory investor subsidies uber s claim that its growth resulted from customers freely choosing its superior service in competitive markets is fundamentally false competitive markets use price and profit signals to help allocate resources to more efficient uses uber grew because its years of billion dollar subsidies totally distorted those signals and allowed it to drive more efficient producers out of business uber s investors always sought to exploit artificial market power uber s investors always had a coherent strategy for earning returns on their investment but this strategy was never based on building a company that could make money in competitive markets through powerful efficiency advantages from the outset the investors strat egy was to use massive subsidies to achieve extremely rapid growth their goal was to attract a massive valuation based on this growth and capital markets willingness to ignore the lack of profits because of the expectation that uber would achieve the same type of growth economics as other prominent tech start ups from early on investors hoped that uber s heavily subsidized growth would allow the company to rapidly achieve global dominance of urban car services investors expected that such industry dominance would give uber s platform huge and sustainable economic power akin to what platform companies like amazon and facebook have achieved the expectation was that this artificial market power would eventually allow the company to generate the profits that its operating economics could never produce in a com petitive market in pursuit of high equity valuations and eventual industry domi nance former ceo travis kalanick established a ruthless monomaniacal growth at any cost corporate culture this culture facilita ted legal disobedience competitor sabotage harassment of critical journalists and of people who had sued uber obstruction of local law enforcement and intellectual property theft start ups that can finance growth out of positive cash flow do not need to valorize behavior like this but uber s investors knew it served as a signal that its eventual marketplace dominance was inevitable that com petitive or regulatory resistance was futile and that journalistic probing was pointless while silicon valley observers widely understood that uber was pursuing industry dominance the company developed pr narratives to distract the general public from its anticompetitive objectives it emphasized how much uber customers loved its smartphone app the heart of its platform yet uber s popularity was not driven by a superior user interface but by the fact that its massive subsidies allowed the app to show more cab availability at lower prices than the traditional cab companies with comparable apps could show uber promoters also falsely claimed that its growth was the result of powerful network economies produced by uber s platform that had magically converted taxis into a winner take all business needless to say none of these claims were backed by any evidence of actual network economies and no one could explain how these alleged platform based economies could create quasi monopoly power in an industry that had never even shown regional tendencies toward concentration nor could they explain why no smartphone app based platforms in any other industry airlines pizza delivery services etc had ever driven most incumbents out of business or created close to a hundred billion dollars in corporate value in reality uber never had any of these platform based network economies or any of the other strengths that allowed companies like amazon and facebook to profitably grow companies like amazon and facebook have many problematic aspects but unlike uber they achieved market power by first building a legitimate business base amazon developed enormous efficiency breakthroughs in e com merce and distribution while facebook introduced a wildly popular new communication tool that had huge network effects both com panies quickly generated strong enough cash flow to fund growth towards market dominance the market power of companies like amazon and facebook was the result of their size industry dominance and immunity from new competitive threats it was not created by their user interfaces plat form power became a shorthand term for their overall market power since the vast majority of consumers and suppliers had to deal with the platform whether they liked the company or not uber s investors understood that this market power allows amazon and facebook to economically squeeze workers suppliers and cities to manipulate the data presented to consumers to force users to cede control of their personal data and to expand into other markets where they have no advantages other than platform ubiquity uber has exploited some of this artificial market power against its drivers but even with billions in predatory subsidies it could never achieve the dominance and immunity from competition needed to exploit market power on a scale similar to amazon and facebook maintaining growth expectations thus required manufacturing narratives about expansion opportunities both within and beyond uber s core car service business as with the platform power winner take all narratives they depended on a willingness within silicon valley to assume that the link between amazon like growth rates and eventual amazon like equity appreciation is so obvious that there s no need to examine whether amazon like economics or market conditions actually apply here uber s original narrative about years of global expansion driven by a powerful business model that could overwhelm incumbent cab companies anywhere has already been abandoned this was replaced by a narrative claiming huge synergies that would allow uber s driv ers to use the company s platform to profitably serve a variety of new markets such as urban logistics and food delivery needless to say no evidence documenting that the alleged synergies actually existed or that they were strong enough to enable uber to serve these markets profitably was ever produced uber faces established efficient competitors in these markets which have even fewer com petitive barriers than taxi service companies need to have strong and growing core business profits and cash flow before they can expand into other lower margin businesses the evidence suggests these businesses remain very unprofitable and only remain in place so that uber s ipo prospectus could show that the raw size of its operations was still growing to deal with increasing awareness of its years of huge car service losses uber has trumpeted its major investments in autonomous vehicles it claims this would transform profitability since eliminating drivers would remove 60 percent of uber s costs but there is no evidence that stage 5 automation cars with no steering wheels is remotely close to widespread commercial adoption and uber gets zero return from its investments in this area until it is moreover the economic impacts of this potential change for uber are not as straightforward as the company s boosters claim while automation would hypothetically allow car services to eliminate drivers these savings would be offset especially at first by much higher vehicle costs along with major capital risks that uber currently avoids it is unclear whether any single firm would eventually dominate this hypothetical industry but there is no reason to believe uber would be the most likely company to do so the most ambitious or perhaps desperate narrative around uber is that its true market potential is not taxis but the entire ur ban transport business uber it is claimed will eventually displace private car ownership and become the amazon of transportation uber s ipo prospectus highlights that the 26 billion miles consumers traveled using uber s platform in 2018 represent less than 1 percent of the company s true market potential but nothing uber has done or publicly contemplated is remote ly comparable to amazon s integrated e commerce businesses uber has no hope of expanding its transport services beyond taxis uber s costs are higher than traditional cab operators and nothing in uber s ipo prospectus offers any clue as to how it could ever reduce its costs to the point where they became competitive with mass transit or private cars the political significance of uber s anti regulatory strategy uber s investors were always focused on the need to create the artificial market power that would allow the company to maximize the value of industry dominance this meant that uber had to achieve an explicitly political objective the complete elimination of governmental oversight over taxi service taxis like every other form of urban transport have never been able to function as a totally private investor backed industry and have always been regulated taxis are a part of a city s transport infrastructure providing service to areas and at times of day where other transit service is poor or nonexistent and in limited cases e g airport trips providing an economical alternative to private cars unlike totally discretionary consumer goods public goods like transport education safety and health care create important exter nal benefits access to jobs increased development opportunities that private operators cannot recapture but are critical to a city s economic health regulation was also designed to cope with the inherent structural problems affecting taxi economics described earlier it is impossible to simultaneously maximize public benefits service levels market competition and profitability actions to improve one of these var iables beyond a given point will inevitably make at least one of the others much worse people will not pay the fares that would cover the true cost of having sparkling clean cabs with well trained and reasonably paid drivers constantly available raising fares or limiting service to high demand zones where cab utilization could be maxim ized would destroy most of the critical public benefits taxis create given the structural profitability problems unregulated operators would undersupply safety protections insurance and vehicle main tenance and would naturally tend to eliminate competition in order to increase pricing power regulation also ensured that voters and taxpayers effectively controlled taxi service just as they owned and controlled the urban highway and transit services that also provide important economic benefits regulators responsible to voters could establish a rough compromise between the irreconcilable objectives of maximizing public benefits service levels competition and profitability this rough compromise kept fares vaguely within reach of lower and middle income citizens and rationed peak capacity by congestion and longer waits as is done with rush hour expressway and transit capacity the combination of fare and entry regulations roughly ensured that total market revenue covered total market costs including a living wage for drivers and that the burdens of empty backhauls as well as the advantages of peak demand were widely shared uber s narratives directly copied libertarian propaganda unlike previous silicon valley start ups uber made pr spend ing a top priority from day one other start ups could rely on factual evidence about competitive advantages and financial results perhaps supplemented by some pr spin uber had much greater communication challenges and had to artificially manufacture its entire public image it had to convince the public that its growth was entirely based on powerful technological innovations and superior efficiency while avoiding any scrutiny of its actual economics especially its multibillion dollar subsidies and losses it had to convince politicians and journalists that it was a tech company that had created an entirely new industry with unique dynamics not a transportation company that could be forced to obey rules governing transportation companies it had to convince silicon valley investors that its valuation should be based on the virtually limitless growth opportunities that companies like amazon and facebook enjoyed and it had to sell the idea that all of the taxi industry s historic service and financial problems had been caused by regulators and that allowing uber to dominate a laissez faire industry would magically solve them uber needed to convince local governments to transfer control of the taxi industry from democratically accountable bodies to private investors a move that no local citizens had been demanding recognizing that all of these objectives had political components uber was the first company to build its entire pr program around the emotive propaganda style narratives that have long dominated partisan political campaigns luckily for uber a campaign perfectly suited to its needs had been manufactured a few decades prior 12 in the early 1990s a coordinated campaign advocating taxi deregulation was conducted by a variety of pro corporate libertar ian think tanks that all received funding from charles and david koch this campaign pursued the same deregulation that uber s investors needed and used classic political propaganda techniques it emphasized emotive themes designed to engage tribal loyalties and convert complex issues into black and white moral battles where compromise was impossible there was an emphasis on simple attractive conclusions designed to obscure the actual objectives of the campaigners and their lack of sound supporting evidence 13 this campaign s narratives repeated across dozens of publications included framing taxi deregulation as a heroic battle for pro gress innovation and economic freedom its main claims were that thousands of struggling entrepreneurial drivers had been blocked from job opportunities by the cab cartel and the corrupt regulators beholden to them and that consumers would enjoy the same benefits that airline deregulation had produced in a word consumers were promised a free lunch taxi deregulation would lead to lower fares solve the problems of long waits provide much greater service especially in neighborhoods where service was poor and increase jobs and wages for drivers of course no data or analysis of actual taxi economics showing how these wondrous benefits could be produced was included when uber began operations in 2010 the company immediately adopted this think tank template on a virtually copy and paste basis but uber succeeded where the think tanks had failed because its investor funded subsidies allowed it to directly link these manu factured narratives about innovations and the evils of taxi regulation to the tangible albeit unsustainable benefits of increased service and lower fares but it never explained how it could do those things profitably or why no one else in the history of the taxi industry had ever discovered uber s magic formula as is frequently seen in partisan political contexts the central framing of uber s pr narrative was an epic us versus them battle with fundamental moral issues at stake uber the heroic technology innovator was fighting a battle for progress and economic free dom against regulation the enemy that uber s investors had to vanquish the us versus them framing stokes tribal loyalties and the moral battle against evil forces framing precludes the possibility of careful analysis open debate or compromise in uber s case it prevented people from looking at data about actual taxi industry economics or regulatory issues framing it as a battle for innovation and freedom masked less popular underlying objectives such as the elimination of competition safety protections or the right of urban citizens to exercise oversight over important transport services despite massive funding from silicon valley and other institutional investors uber depicted itself as the innocent victim in trepid programmers facing overwhelming disadvantages in their battle with the evil taxi cartel and the corrupt regulators protecting it one venture capitalist defended uber by arguing uber is so obviously a good thing that you can measure how corrupt cities are by how hard they try to suppress it 14 anyone who did not take uber s side was painted as a bleeding heart clueless about the trade offs that economic progress actually requires the effectiveness of uber s anti regulatory propaganda was clear as early as 2012 when it demonstrated that it could easily mobilize its wealthier customers to flood local officials with social media messages whenever they threatened to apply ordinary taxi regulations to uber those customers remained oblivious to the subsidies behind their service and local officials remained oblivious to the fact that these displays of grassroots support had been artificially manufactured taxi deregulation cannot produce the same benefits as airline deregulation there was already ample historical evidence that taxi deregulation would not produce the kind of benefits uber was promising in the early 1980s immediately following airline deregulation seventeen u s cities deregulated their taxi industries and then quickly re versed course when the efficiency gains and consumer benefits failed to materialize subsequent academic research as well as studies by the urban mass transit administration documented that fares in these cities rose faster than in other cities taxi productivity actually declined added service was limited to already well served areas like airports added driver employment was negligible and the added service quickly disappeared because fare revenue didn t cover oper ating costs 15 since uber knew that few would remember the failed 1980s taxi deregulation efforts its promoters repeated the false think tank claim that the taxi deregulation they were seeking was modeled after 1970s airline deregulation and could be expected to produce similar benefits 16 unlike uber s efforts however airline deregulation was enacted through transparent legislative processes and based on open discussion and independent analysis of the potential consumer and public welfare impacts and unlike uber s totally laissez faire objec tives airline deregulation was strictly limited to liberalizing entry and pricing limitations while actually strengthening antitrust con sumer and labor protections as well as financial reporting rules airline deregulation sought to increase competition while ensuring level playing field conditions uber on the other hand was seeking to eliminate its competition while simultaneously ensuring that incumbents still had to follow the rules that uber was ignoring airline deregulation also eliminated dc 3 era rules e g no market entry had been permitted since 1933 that independent studies had shown to have created serious inefficiencies in the 747 era in the case of car services however no taxi regulations had been rendered obsolete by radical changes in the technology and costs of driving taxis and no independent studies have shown any industry inefficiencies were caused by any specific regulations uber also falsely claimed that its surge pricing system would solve the peak demand problem and produce the same efficiency gains as airline revenue management but the airline approach de pends on major economic differences between long haul intercity and short haul urban transport peak airline demand includes a mix of time sensitive and price sensitive but schedule flexible customers airline variable pricing offers price sensitive passengers big discounts to shift to flights that would otherwise have had empty seats this allows the airline to significantly reduce the number of planes and staff needed to serve a given level of overall demand thus both industry efficiency and consumer welfare increase uber s surge pricing by contrast reduces overall consumer wel fare which is why regulators never allowed it previously 17 virtually all peak urban travelers are extremely time sensitive and unlike airline passengers cannot comparison shop for travel options well in advance no taxi users will shift their saturday night plans to tuesday morning to get a lower fare higher peak taxi fares will not get night shift workers to find different jobs uber s surge pricing does not improve productivity and does not reduce the high cost of peak taxi capacity less wealthy passengers the majority of the market are simply priced out of the market so wealthy customers can have shorter wait times and with industry dominance surge pricing becomes a tool that would allow uber to gouge customers at will uber s market entry has in fact confirmed all of the major economic justifications for taxi regulation unlimited market entry has created ruinous overcapacity so that no one can make money and otherwise viable operators get driven out of business uber clearly undersupplied safety insurance and basic consumer protec tions relative to even the minimal levels regulators had required 18 in pursuit of revenue maximization uber pricing reduces major exter nal public benefits such as the ability of lower income citizens to reach jobs poorly served by transit taxi regulations provided a rough compromise between legitimate competing interests administered by officials accountable to voters uber is solely focused on the objective of private capital accumulation manipulating the media to push the successful innovator narrative by effectively manipulating media biases uber not only limited critical reporting but got the business and tech industry press to enthusiastically amplify its preferred narratives and to almost totally ignore the economics of the company and the industry the company fed the media appetite for prepackaged easy to grasp narratives no news outlet wanted to miss the story of how uber could be the next amazon and by faithfully repeating uber s narra tives they would maintain access to the uber senior executives that would make their stories stand out uber s heroic innovator narratives indulged the natural biases of the reporters embedded in silicon valley where tech companies are viewed as the major driver of economic progress since re porters ignored uber s subsidies and all other economic evidence the link between uber s breakthrough innovations and improved cheaper service was treated as an established fact and since this innova tion was accepted as a powerful force these reporters saw no need to understand anything about the old line industry being disrupt ed mainstream coverage of uber almost never included interviews of anyone with firsthand knowledge of urban transport economics the most emphatic endorsements of uber s narratives came from the liberal mainstream media based in new york and washington despite its libertarian silicon valley origins uber recognized the importance of establishing strong user support in democratic cities like these and hired david plouffe barack obama s campaign man ager to head its pr efforts wealthy elites in these cities were espe cially enthusiastic about uber s improved cheaper service and so report ers had little interest in digging into the subsidies driver exploitation or regulatory disobedience issues outlets like the new york times washington post new yorker bloomberg and the atlantic19 were apparently oblivious to the fact that they were amplifying claims crafted by koch funded groups designed to undermine market competition the concept of urban transport as a public good and the legitimacy of any form of reg ulatory authority the regular repetition of the company s narrative by seemingly independent elite outlets concealed its manufactured top down origins and established it as accepted public opinion not requiring further debate for those reporters not susceptible to heroic tech innovator narratives uber provided the dominance is inevitable narrative one did not need to have a silicon valley worldview to see that the company s massive funding and ruthless culture were running roughshod over any competitor regulator or journalist raising the slightest doubt about uber s eventual success if the end result was a foregone conclusion there was no need to investigate whether uber actually had the superior efficiencies normally required to drive competitors out of business moreover the mainstream media journalists who had ignored economics were also incapable of explaining 2017 s rash of public controversies and board turmoil uber had been sabotaging com petitors disobeying laws and engaging in other problematic behav ior for years but the reporters who were invested in either the heroic innovator or inevitable dominance narratives simply ignored problematic behavior or passed it off as the natural by product of silicon valley bro culture 20 uber s wave of bad publicity crested with susan fowler s blog post about the company s cover up of systemic sexual harassment 21 other issues included a major google lawsuit alleging theft of its driverless car intellectual property a video showing kalanick s pro fane tirade against a driver who had challenged compensation cuts and the revelation that uber senior executives had improperly ob tained the confidential police files of a woman raped by an uber driver but because they had always ignored uber s economics the press failed to see that this behavior was the direct result of kalanick s long standing growth at any cost culture which had always had the full support of the board the press failed to notice that this degree of bad behavior is never seen at companies that can generate strong cash flow and profits based on powerful competitive ad vantages but managers who can produce growth at all costs without real economic advantages know they are free to hit on fe male staff whenever they want the press s failure to refocus uber coverage on business model issues allowed uber to claim that its cultural issues were temporary aberrations that could be fixed with diversity training and by removing a few bad apples it also caused the media to misreport why the board fired kalanick as ceo and replaced him with dara khosrowshahi 22 this was not triggered by the issues raised by fowler but by kalanick s failure to take the company public kalanick had a long range focus he knew that the company s public growth and profitability claims were weak and wanted to delay an ipo until uber had secured greater market power the rebellious investors had no interest in waiting to see if uber could become even more valuable in the next few years how ever some of those investors may have been concerned that the window in which tech ipos were seen as a hot commodity was closing others may have been concerned that uber might never be able to go public with actual evidence of profitable growth khosrowshahi committed to an ipo in 2019 and will get a 100 million bonus if he achieves a valuation of 120 billion one of the most innovative disruptive companies ever developing powerful competitive breakthroughs is hard figuring out how to generate strong positive cash flow from them while fighting established incumbents is even harder uber s innovative strategy was to skip all this really hard stuff the company s strategy was to use an unprecedented level of investment funding to bulldoze its way directly to industry dominance and exploitable market power and create a growth trajectory that would allow it to demand an amazon facebook caliber equity valuation this strategy was bolstered by a hyperaggressive monomaniacal growth at any cost culture by pr techniques that masked uber s losses as well as its lack of competitive advantages and its open pursuit of unregulated industry dominance uber s investors fully understood that achieving extremely rapid growth and dominance without any meaningful efficiency advantages would require funding unprecedented levels of predatory subsidies investors provided 13 billion in equity funding through 2015 and 20 billion through 2018 this was 2 300 times the equity funding that amazon required before its ipo unlike uber amazon could fund its growth out of positive cash flow generated by its powerful efficiency advantages uber s investors meanwhile under stood what was required and never complained about either the huge funding demands or the ongoing losses any bottom line evaluation of uber must start with the fact that the company has not built the proverbial better mousetrap it has not materially reduced the cost or improved the productivity of taxis uber has not discovered a way to profitably provide enough taxi capacity to ensure users could instantly get one whenever they touched a smartphone button but the company did discover an innovative disruptive strategy that allowed a small group of private investors to create almost 100 billion in corporate value out of thin air today s uber is clearly more popular than traditional taxi service but this observation is economically meaningless the only valid comparisons are with a hypothetical subsidy free uber that could produce today s prices and service levels along with sustainable profits if uber could somehow convert the 14 plus billion that it lost in the last four years to sustainable growing profits it would be one the biggest corporate turnarounds in history conversely if uber fails to find the billions of dollars in operating efficiencies that it couldn t find over the past nine years it will have a devastating impact on the urban car service industry and the hundreds of cities that depend on taxis as it struggles to reduce losses it will be free to cut service and gouge the customers and drivers who are no longer protected by either regulations or meaningful competition but uber s demonstrated ability to use raw economic power on an unprecedented scale makes the risks to society even worse it has demonstrated how billions in investment capital can fund the subsi dies and artificially manufactured narratives that can totally skew how competitive markets are supposed to work it was able to sup press already dismal wage and working conditions to sub minimum wage levels while politicians and the media applauded its executives as heroic innovators it was able to nullify long standing laws and regulations and effectively privatize a key part of urban transport infrastructure totally outside normal democratic processes uber s investors benefited from a massive reallocation of industry resources to much less efficient uses capital markets declared that uber might be the most valuable transportation company in world history without demanding actual evidence of improved efficiency or even a plausible explanation of how revenues could someday ex ceed costs other silicon valley investors amassed staggering riches while inflicting enormous damage on the rest of society e g creating an uncontrollable surveillance apparatus poisoning public discourse exploiting massive anticompetitive power but in these cases one can at least point to some offsetting benefits search engines lower retail prices useful social media tools one can also argue that in a different political environment most of these gains could have been achieved while avoiding most of the costs uber meanwhile is unique because it is entirely exploitive it has not created any sustainable offsetting benefits the private wealth it has created comes entirely at the expense of the rest of society in this it at least helps destroy the last illusions that twenty first century capitalism is being operated to serve the greater good uber always depended on pursuing artificial market power and destroying any constraints on the exercise of that power it was always explicitly transferring wealth from labor to capital and from democratically accountable public control to totally unaccountable private control uber is important because it also illustrates that propaganda techniques can be just as powerful in corporate settings as they have been in partisan political settings despite nine years of disastrous financial results and exposés of bad behavior that would have destroyed most companies the press refuses to reconsider its narra tive valorizing uber as a heroic innovator that has created huge benefits for consumers and cities the mainstream media doesn t even

eur managing to recover from a thursday intraweek low 1 1116 out of the u s on the data front key stats were skewed to the negative in the week following memorial day on monday may consumer confidence figures provide direction on tuesday the cb consumer confidence index continued its upward trajectory rising from 129 2 to 134 1 the move back to close to 18 year highs provided the greenback with support early in the week following a quiet wednesday 1st quarter gdp trade jobless claims and pending home sales provided direction on thursday while 2nd estimate gdp numbers were in line with forecasts and the weekly jobless claims figures held relatively steady pending home sales and a widening in the u s trade deficit were negatives on the day in spite of the u s president s efforts to address trade imbalances the goods trade deficit widened from 71 33bn to 72 12bn in april perhaps of greater interest however was more disappointing numbers from the housing sector pending home sales fell by 1 5 in april the numbers came off the back of a 0 4 fall in existing home sales and a 6 9 slide in new home sales in april the pullback came in spite of the downward trend in mortgage rates from last november s latest high story continues wrapping up the week the fed s preferred inflation numbers personal spending chicago pmi and finalized consumer sentiment figures were released on friday lackluster personal spending figures core inflation at 1 6 and weaker than prelim economic sentiment figures weighed on the day outside of the stats the markets continued to focus on trump and

again the dow fell by 3 01 with the nasdaq s p500 falling by 2 41 and 2 62 respectively a particularly bearish month left the nasdaq down by 7 93 for the month of may the dow and s p500 fell by 6 69 and by 6 58 respectively out of the uk there were no material stats to provide direction in the week the lack of stats left the markets to react to the eu parliamentary elections and focus on brexit and uk parliament a brexit party and liberal democrat 1 2 put the pound under pressure at the start of the week while theresa may s decision to step down had provided support to the pound in the previous week concerns over the next pm s stance on brexit weighed in the week a pro brexiteer raises the prospects of a no deal departure which is sterling negative the pound fell by 0 67 in the week

the global economy weighed on the week out of the eurozone the stats were skewed to the negative in the week positives in the week were limited to a jump in french consumer spending fewer jobseekers

results in the week while business confidence saw a marginal improvement in may building consents tumbled for a 2nd month in a row adding to the negative bias was the rbnz s financial stability report

by just 0 1 in the 1st quarter the annualized gdp figure came in at 0 4 falling short of a forecasted 0 7 growth rate in spite of the relatively positive numbers the boc monetary policy decision on

risk aversion ran wild as stock markets and other risk assets plummeted on global tariff escalation the us dollar s early gains during the end of may market rout is starting to reverse course on expectations the fed may cut rates twice this year stocks are licking their wounds following a double dose of negative trade news the first bullet came from china s retaliatory measures that will deliver a crippling blow to multi nationals and likely further downgrade earnings forecasts as the sino us relationship appears to going towards a path of irreparable damage the second bullet came from the escalation in trade tensions between mexico and us which pretty much came out of nowhere the trade spat with china has been brewing but markets were taken back with the us actions towards mexico the us mexico and canada were in the process of getting the usmca approved with their respective governments but that may have hit a road block now president trump s attack to their southern neighbor saw a mexican response that us exports of grains pork and apples may be hit with tariffs tariff escalation is detrimental to global growth and the bond market saw bunds fall to a record low and the 10 year treasury yield dropped to a fresh 20 month low and fell further below the fed s fund target range markets will continue to care about every incremental trade update but they should also closely pay attention to a couple important rate decisions and a wrath of fed speak which includes chair powell s discussion on policy strategy on monday president trump will also make a state visit to the uk where he will meet with queen elizabeth and pm may tuesday the rba is expected to cut rates and we hear from fed chairman jerome powell at a fed research conference wednesday the eia releases their crude oil weekly report and the fed releases the beige book and members clarida and bostic speak on thursday the ecb will keep policy steady and update their economic forecasts friday will see pm may step down as the leader of the conservative party and have the release of the us employment report which expects to see hiring deliver 185 000 new jobs in may rba to cut rates and signal more are coming ecb to downgrade forecasts and give details on next round of tltros fed s speakers to address recent trade war escalation and possible capitulation on cuts rba on tuesday the reserve bank of australia rba is widely expected to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1 25 with investors focusing on how many more cuts will be queued up only 5 of economists two specifically see the rba keep rates steady at the last meeting the rba surprised many when they kept policy following disappointingly weak first quarter inflation the rba may decide on holding off on confirming any additional rate cuts preferring to see how the global growth slowdown hits their domestic economy the recent global bond rally took the australian 10 year yield below the rba s cash rate of 1 5 for the first time since 2015 analysts are piling on the rate cut bets jp morgan sees rates falling to 0 50 by mid 2020 while westpac and capital economics see cuts targeting 0 75 with tame inflation the rba s easing decision should be an easy one the australian dollar remains near the lows of the year as the recent escalation in trade wars dims global growth outlooks and while data points in the asia pacific continue to deteriorate with china s may manufacturing pmi falling back into contraction expectations remain high the pboc will come to the rescue while the market begins pricing in further rba rate cuts we could limited australian dollar downside as the greater driver could be the fed s capitulation with delivering their own rate cuts fed a wrath of federal reserve members will speak next week with investors waiting to see further confirming signals that the fed will provide further accommodation shortly on tuesday fed chair jerome powell will discuss monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices at the fed s framework review conference in chicago markets have not heard from powell since the trade war went on steroids and he could use this as his stage to begin capitulate and signal accommodation is needed the fed s preferred core price measure in april stayed steady at 1 6 but still comfortably below the fed s 2 target the us trade war escalations with china and mexico will likely dominate the fed s concerns here and while the data dependent script may suggest they need to see further data confirm weakness they might agree that is not necessary ecb the ecb rate decision is expected to see no change with rates and possibly minor downgrades with their economic forecasts the central bank will also deliver more details on the expected launch of its third round of targeted long term refinancing operations in september economists are expecting them to use tltros as a backstop which could provide insurance in times of heightened uncertainty with most of the other g7 central banks on the verge of providing stimulus expectations are rising for the ecb to also provide fresh support to the ailing economy global trade wars are raising the risk for a euro zone recession but that is still not the base case the current implied interest rate probabilities see a 53 chance that the ecb cuts rates at the january 23rd 2020 meeting the upcoming meeting should see the ecb provide a slight adjustment to forward guidance becoming more accommodative economists however still are not abandoning a rate hike in the near future and that should provide some support for the euro a reuters poll showed 47 of the 60 contributors expect a rate hike at some point between now and the end of 2020 while 3 saw a cut and the rest expect no change in rates the euro remains stuck in very tight range and we should see 1 11 remain formidable support while 1 1250 provides initial resistance oil the month of may was a disaster for crude prices the worst may performance in seven years as unabrupt escalation with global trade war saw the global growth outlook crumble oil prices have now given up the lion share of the effects of the opec production cuts geopolitical risks remain in place but right now demand growth is in freefall and oil remains vulnerable the us china trade war remains most critical to the global growth outlook but the addition of trade tensions between the us and mexico raised the slower demand picture for the americas west texas intermediate crude s selloff is now around 20 lower from the april 23rd high of 66 60 with rising expectations that opec will be less effective in signaling continued production cuts going forward crude will need to rely on some positive outcomes on the trade front for prices to begin stabilizing gold it took a while but gold prices finally broke out higher after the trade war escalation led to a code red for global growth a devastating month for equities the worst one since december and other risk assets saw a global bond rally lead the way for safe haven assets the yellow metal is once again becoming an attractive safe haven as markets will remain skeptical on any

chirashree das gupta is a political economist and associate professor at the centre for the study of law and governance jawaharlal nehru university new delhi sunanda sen and maria cristina marcuzzo eds the changing face of imperialism colonialism to contemporary capitalism new york routledge 2018 338 pages 145 hardcover situated largely within the marxist debates on imperialism but addressing the liberal formulations too the changing face of imperialism colonialism to contemporary capitalism is an important intervention regarding the material basis of imperialism and its three hundred year old history of unequal power relations the book consists of an introduction by the editors sunanda sen and maria cristina marcuzzo followed by fourteen chapters arranged thematically five chapters are devoted to exploring the conceptual basis of imperialism three to analyses of patterns of contemporary imperialism another three chapters to the relationship between imperialism and colonial control and the last three to the link between contemporary capitalism and the indian economy the book broadly addresses five issues 1 the nature of finance capital and the novel yet familiar processes of value extraction 2 the world of capital 3 global production networks and labor regimes 4 the institutional system of nation states in the new global order and 5 the nature of integration from colonial regimes to now the discussions on finance capital are hinged on the differences between the john hobson rudolf hilferding v i lenin thesis and the notions of contemporary imperialism advanced by prabhat patnaik and satyaki roy patnaik roy and noemi levi orlik all analyze the implication of the political hegemony of the dollar and the rentier accumulation that characterizes this regime of primary accumulation of finance capital anjan chakrabarti roy john smith and byasdeb dasgupta locate the specificities of value extraction processes in the structure and nature of global production networks and contemporary labor regimes however chakrabarti and dasgupta veer toward an analysis of contemporary imperialism that bases the labor process in informality and dualism surajit mazumdar argues that the discussion on the nature of the integration of countries like india into the global circuit of capital has been on subordinate terms and has led to a premature deindustrialization in the case of india subhanil chowdhury demonstrates the ambiguities of the definition of foreign direct investment and the lack of maneuvering space for the bourgeoisies of india and china amiya bagchi sen gerald epstein and utsa patnaik address the possibilities and limits of the nation state in an imperialist international order in doing so the focus is on both the relationship between the metropolitan working class and the metropolitan ruling classes as well as the relationship between the metropolitan working class and the working class of the periphery this creates room for the debate on decoupling to be addressed in fresh ways it also points to the possibilities and limits of south south and north south solidarities in the opening essay titled imperialism the old and the new departures and continuities roy provides a critical overview of the major marxian theories and debates on imperialism among all the debates he argues the most contentious has been that on the role of the nation state he concludes that oppressors of the world at various levels are far more integrated and interdependent than ever before but the complex network of hierarchies that characterize the current phase of capitalist domination is always potent with fissures and ruptures that might not have a national character as it used to be earlier 34 he argues that in the sphere of distribution conflicts today are more apparent in terms of class than between nations smith in his essay marx s capital and the global crisis provides a value theory of contemporary imperialism that reinforces roy s argument but moves it from the sphere of distribution to the sphere of creation of value he contends that neoliberal globalization is solely dependent on the global labor arbitrage arising from the higher degree of exploitation prevalent in export oriented industries in low wage nations 56 according to smith this superexploitation is based on the third form of surplus value increase in marx s exposition whereby capitalists outsource production and push the wage of the worker down below the value of his labour power effectively capturing additional value from low wage countries 52 this form of value capture is distinct from the more familiar increases in absolute and relative surplus value and is the defining feature of the neoliberal era thus national solutions based on xenophobia that intensify this form of value capture are unworkable struggles to abolish national racial hierarchies and tremendous disparities based on the principle of equality of all working people are the only way forward for smith in reflections on contemporary imperialism prabhat patnaik focuses on the contemporary phase of imperialism as the hegemony of international finance capital which is distinct from the finance capital of the early twentieth century that was the subject of lenin s analysis as well as karl kautsky s thesis of internationally united finance capital finance capital requires an unrestricted arena of operations globally leading to a muting of interimperialist rivalry but while finance capital is international the state remains a nation state the state must willy nilly bow to the wishes of finance capital and to justify this change the interests of finance are increasingly passed off as being synonymous with the interests of society 65 my italics this hegemony of finance capital has thrown up new contradictions the most significant of which is a reduction in the share of wages in total world output neoliberalism has created a tendency towards overproduction engendering inequalities in world income distribution 70 it undermines the capacity of the state to play a role in demand management and saddles it with acute current account deficits the crisis manifests primarily as a crisis of aggregate demand in the first world with unemployment and unutilized capacities in addition to these conditions which also prevail in the third world the third world sees an impoverishment of peasants and petty producers through a process of primitive accumulation but this latter difference is important as the class alliances in the struggle against imperialism shift in his essay the particularity of imperialism in the stage of neoliberal globalization and global capitalism a dialogue between nikolai bukharin and aimé césaire chakrabarti attempts to synthesize bukharin s concept of the colonial outside in a spatial sense with imperialism as a policy of conquest along with césaire s outside that is the perspective of from the negro location 78 the argument is that these two perspectives are synthesized to formulate a theory of the outside which the author calls world of the third this outside is not only a product of imperialism driven by the nation state what is called external imperialism but also of domestically induced policy of conquest of world of the third carried out at the behest of global capital 79 this is achieved in the contemporary period with reforms of domestic neoliberal policies along with alliances with the political and business establishments of other nation states such as the brics brazil russia india china and south africa and the association of southeast asian nations countries the policy of conquest involves both repressive and ideological apparatuses of the ruling dispensation which help tie global capital to all corners of the globe thus imperialism cannot be ended without ending capitalism anti imperialism should be a work that encompasses both the so called external and internal in world of the third based on a wide array of data chowdhury in his chapter is imperialism a relevant concept in today s world argues that much of the developing countries rising share of world gross domestic product is from a small set of brics countries the most significant being china and india moreover this growth has not led to any significant rise in workers wages in developing countries even though capitalists in these countries have amassed huge amounts of wealth thus the third world continues to exist but new aspiring capitalists from these countries are staking their claim in the global capitalist order 113 despite the huge current account deficit of the united states dollar hegemony continues backed by u s military might and arms trade as well as the country s strict control over the oil producing regions of the world through war thus imperialism remains ever relevant to understanding the current conjuncture the second part of the book focuses on patterns of contemporary imperialism with two essays on latin america and one on the united states orlik argues that aside from wage depression financialization and neomercantilism have been the new modes of surplus appropriation in latin america in the age of neoliberalism there is of course a pecking order in the appropriation of this surplus the united states at the top followed by other developed countries that control technology then developing countries with external current account surpluses and high investment spending and at the bottom the latin american and caribbean economies that adopted neomercantilism but failed to achieve external surpluses and were forced to liberalize their financial markets bagchi examines the political economy of hope and fear both of which signify latin america since most of the left wing regimes in latin america depend on revenue from oil and gas to maintain their social democratic programs any decline in prices of these commodities creates disaffection which is then manipulated by the united states to destabilize left wing regimes as was done in brazil and venezuela thus argues bagchi the only way to be an effective buffer against u s imperial interference is to become less dependent on nonrenewable resources 168 gerald epstein dwells on the peculiarities of the united states as the leader of imperialist nations a point also addressed by radhika desai in her book geopolitical economy london pluto 2013 epstein argues that in the period between 1985 and 2000 the u s working class did not gain from imperialism on the contrary it suffered huge material losses by bearing the cost of military power and wars not to mention from wage compression reflected in consumption shares the world of capital and its outside is addressed in the section on imperialism and the colonial context essays by sen and utsa patnaik establish the twin nature of unrequited transfers from colonial india that financed the proliferation of the british empire from the unrequited exports of labor from india to the unrequited trade surplus under british colonialism sabyasachi bhattacharya argues that standardization of labour regulations through an international legal normative regime was one of the means of overcoming the wage cost differentials that the colonialists faced due to higher wages in the metropole 261 but this regulatory regime covered a miniscule part of the indian labor force and left the bulk outside its ambit thus proliferating the wage cost differential the last section of the book explores the relationship between contemporary capitalism and the indian economy the penetration of finance insurance and real estate is an important aspect of this relationship as demonstrated empirically by sukanya bose and abhishek kumar dasgupta elucidates the modalities of global capitalism today that thrives on ensuring greater control of labour through flexible labour regime world over 308 neoliberal flexible labor rules are imposed on distant lands by contemporary imperialism through the aegis of multilateral institutions like the international monetary fund and the world bank mazumdar presents a detailed study of the nature of india s integration into the global market and demonstrates through a range of empirical evidence that the underlying and entrenched vulnerabilities and dependencies inherent in the nature of indian integration also circumscribes its capacity to play an autonomous leading role on the global stage whether as a partner or as a rival of advanced capitalisms 327 the book s unique analytical edge lies in the distinctively collaborative intellectual and political enterprise it presents between scholars of the north and the south and despite the heterogeneity of its component sections and chapters the book contains a central running thread the penetration of finance as an autonomous sphere of accumulation is the sine qua non of imperialism in contemporary times this has had several manifestations the most significant of which has been worsening income distribution but what comes out most significantly is the continued flow of unrequited transfers the colonial triangular trade home charges taxation and rent along with labor and commodity exports were different ways in which this unrequited transfer was perpetuated by the colonial regime in different periods of history contemporary imperialism has shifted to direct value capture that is pure exploitation and superexploitation through global production networks and global value chains to do this the nation state is invaluable in maintaining the uneven world through borders not only for cross border rentier capital flows but also to ensure conditions of global labor arbitrage for the purpose of value capture it also ensures that no autonomous development is possible for so called emerging economies thus the nation state is the sole entity that maintains all social conditions and institutions that capital requires for its daily operations within the imperialist structure these arguments open up the question of the main site of resistance to imperialism prabhat patnaik argues that the nation state for all of its institutional specificities of maintaining the class order remains the main site of resistance to imperialism while chakrabarti locates resistance in the conjuncture of both negritude and class smith focuses on the emergent north south solidarities as the site of resistance mazumdar emphasizes the need to develop popular struggles that will alter the balance of class forces the bulwark of contemporary imperialism the changing face of imperialism rich in its intellectual offerings raises further questions for example what is the relationship between contemporary imperialism and the rise of neofascism across the world in the last three to four decades how does imperialism constitute the institutional conditions of social reproduction that in turn constitute the reproduction of the contemporary capitalist system these and many other questions are not addressed but the book is a useful point of entry or departure for finding ways and means of resisting contemporary imperialism
on the morning of march 14 2016 in a tiny office in rio de janeiro a libertarian businessman named winston ling met with jair bolsonaro a right wing congressman running a longshot campaign to be president of brazil some of ling s closest associates had pleaded with him not to sit down with bolsonaro who was infamous for public comments praising torture and dictatorship and denigrating women and minorities just associating with him they feared would tarnish brazil s libertarian movement which was drawing new followers at an astounding pace and winning mainstream recognition three years later bolsonaro is president ludwig von mises scholars free market think tankers and even anarcho capitalists now occupy top level positions in his administration where they hope to slash the government bureaucracy of the nation ranked as the absolute worst by the world economic forum in the category of burden of government regulation a country that goes beyond regulating the number of hours that workers spend on the job to micromanaging the size and make of the punch clocks used to record their arrivals and departures i m losing all my guys to government says hélio beltrão founder and president of the brazilian mises institute with a grin but other prominent libertarians are outraged over their former comrades willingness to ally themselves with a politician the intercept has called the most extreme and repellent face of a resurgent evangelical driven right wing attempt to drag the country backwards by decades bolsonaro is not a libertarian in many ways he is sharply un libertarian he has been working to make it easier for police to kill civilians with impunity he has repeatedly praised the military dictatorship that ruled brazil from 1964 to 1985 he has flatly declared himself in favor of torture and in 2002 he said if i see two men kissing in the street i will hit them it shows that their commitment to individual liberty is actually not that strong says joel pinheiro da fonseca a libertarian columnist at folha de s paulo brazil s largest newspaper they want a more authoritarian style of government that can bring about their economic policies more easily ling argues that the country didn t have time to entertain fantasies of a truly principled free market politician rising to power in 2016 when he met with bolsonaro the leftist workers party had controlled the presidency for 13 years brazil s unemployment rate was approaching 12 percent and the economy had contracted by more than 3 percent the prior year for me this was life or death he says i truly believed if someone else were elected president brazil would go down the beginning of bolsonaro s presidency has been chaotic the free marketeers have made some significant progress in cutting red tape but must also contend with powerful special interests that want to maintain the status quo concern is growing that their participation in bolsonaro s administration will damage the libertarian movement and help the workers party win back credibility if bolsonaro fails to meaningfully liberalize the economy says pedro ferreira a co founder of the libertarian free brazil movement we re going to be in a lot of trouble a troublesome alliance jair bolsonaro is best understood as trump without the success in business says paulo roberto de almeida a brazilian political scientist career diplomat and prominent pro market intellectual he s a populist nationalist xenophobe misogynist a former army captain with an undistinguished military career bolsonaro served 27 years in the national congress before he was elected president passing just two minor bills during his entire tenure he was best known for his incendiary public comments in a 2011 interview he told playboy that he would be incapable of loving a homosexual son preferring that a gay child die in an accident in 2016 he said the biggest mistake of the dictatorship that used to rule brazil was to torture and not to kill in march he asked the nation s armed forces to commemorate the 55th anniversary of that coup in his first months in office bolsonaro s most substantive policy proposal has been a draconian anti crime package that includes more lenient treatment of police officers who kill while on duty police shootings have been shockingly rampant in the country for a while in 2017 law enforcement killed 5 144 civilians or 14 people per day in march 2018 two former rio de janeiro police officers were arrested on charges of murdering marielle franco an openly gay city council member by shooting her in the head with a submachine gun according to human rights watch extrajudicial executions by cops are common in 2003 bolsonaro said that as long as the state does not have the courage to adopt the death penalty those death squads in my opinion are very welcome yet bolsonaro also has an uncanny ability to connect with voters which is what drew winston ling s attention every time he came to a city there was a huge number of people at the airport the businessman recalls the 63 year old ling is a founding figure in brazil s libertarian movement or movimento liberal since the portuguese word liberal has retained its classical meaning who helped establish two prominent think tanks in the 1980s he and his siblings co own a handful of companies started by their chinese immigrant father who made a fortune in the soybean and petrochemical industries at their initial meeting in 2016 ling gave bolsonaro a half hour tutorial on the austrian school of free market economics and left him with two books frédéric bastiat s the law and mises economic policy thoughts for today and tomorrow he chose those two he recalls because they re thin and easy to read and politicians don t read he also offered to help bolsonaro assemble a council of free market economists to join his campaign bolsonaro accepted the offer so ling flew home to shanghai and started working through his rolodex nobody wanted to meet him ling recalls because of bolsonaro s reputation as a populist firebrand and a homophobe then ling got in touch with paulo guedes who was immediately very enthusiastic a respected economist who earned a ph d in 1978 from the university of chicago guedes has spent most of his career in finance on november 13 2017 he and bolsonaro had a five hour meeting at a sheraton hotel in rio guedes set the ground rules he would consider working with bolsonaro only if given carte blanche over economic affairs after winning the presidency in october 2018 bolsonaro made guedes super minister putting him in charge of a new ministry of economy that consolidated the government s departments of finance planning industry and commerce guedes then appointed a group of young libertarians to high level roles within the new department guedes brief experience in politics 30 years ago may have discouraged him from working with candidates who are more like minded but have little chance of electoral success in 1989 he helped craft the economic platform of guilherme afif domingos who ran for president on the liberal party ticket they put forward a proposal that brazil privatize every state owned company and then use the revenue to wipe out the federal debt domingos came in sixth and so brazil became a paradise for rent seekers and hell for entrepreneurs guedes later told piauí magazine guedes openness to working with bolsonaro may also derive in part from the efforts of the chicago boys a group of free market economists trained at guedes alma mater who had helped guide chile s economy under the dictator augusto pinochet beginning in the 1970s guedes had no direct involvement with this cohort but he held a teaching job at the university of chile in the early 80s and he has expressed admiration for its economic impact thanks to the chicago boys pinochet lifted price controls slashed red tape sold off state owned companies eased occupational licensing rules and launched a quasi private pension system the chicago boys agenda was derailed in 1982 when an ill advised fixed exchange rate produced an economic crisis but in the long run their reforms worked as intended after the restoration of a democratic government in 1989 chileans voted to continue their program of market liberalism three decades of spectacular growth followed from 1987 to 2017 chile s gross domestic product gdp grew ninefold and its poverty rate declined from 11 7 percent to 0 7 percent of course pinochet also overthrew a democratically elected president censored the press murdered an estimated 3 200 citizens and tortured many more he was willing to back many of the reformers ideas about economic liberty but he violated other liberties in abhorrent ways guedes defenders argue that there s a fundamental difference between his work with bolsonaro and the morally dubious alliance struck by the chicago boys bolsonaro is working within the democratic institutions of brazil says diogo costa a political scientist with a high level position at the ministry of economy who has worked at the libertarian cato institute and atlas economic research foundation i don t think would agree to sign on to a project that violated more fundamental principles some fear on the other hand that bolsonaro will gradually erode those democratic institutions his administration is engaged in a constant war against every single institution that could serve as an opposition to his power says fonseca the libertarian folha de s paulo columnist pedro menezes a 25 year old libertarian who writes for gazeta do povo and infomoney has compared bolsonaro to hugo chávez the late socialist leader of venezuela who dismantled institutional constraints on his power after being elected menezes is particularly troubled by bolsonaro s suggestion that he would consider packing the supreme court and lowering its mandatory retirement age enabling him to appoint more justices menezes decided to distance himself from his country s libertarian movement after attending an october 22 2016 event in são paulo that was organized by the free market leadership training institute bolsonaro a longshot candidate at the time was invited on stage to join in a dialogue with a group of prominent libertarians a large contingent of his supporters showed up baiting the audience with chants of ustra ustra ustra a reference to the notorious carlos alberto brilhante ustra an army colonel who had arrested and tortured dissidents during the military regime bolsonaro made outrageous comments during the event according to menezes but his co panelists treated him respectfully anyway i was so pissed i left in the middle he says it was this transformational moment for me other libertarian leaning groups have kept their distance from brazil s new president partido novo a political party founded in 2011 backed the more orthodox libertarian candidate joão amoêdo in the 2018 election and the young political movement livres which used to be part of the social liberal party psl broke off in january 2018 when bolsonaro took over the larger group in an essay explaining his vote to separate from the psl the political scientist costa wrote that when populism enters through the window freedom goes out the door but after bolsonaro won the election and costa was offered his position in the ministry of economy he took it if i had to work under people who didn t share my vision and values and were committed to a different agenda he says i wouldn t have accepted brazil s most influential libertarian organization is the free brazil movement which helped organize massive street protests in 2015 calling for the impeachment of workers party president dilma rousseff she was removed from office on august 31 2016 the group initially resisted supporting bolsonaro in the 2018 election and tried to build up more reasonable people says ferreira the organization s co founder but brazilians wanted the more extreme option after debating the issue internally the group allied itself with bolsonaro toward the end of his campaign it was a dire situation ferreira argues because if bolsonaro had lost the workers party would have regained the presidency and so the group launched what it called the patriotic journey sending its key representative to brazil s northeast region to convince voters that workers party policies would damage their way of life the movement s charismatic spokesman 23 year old kim kataguiri was elected to congress in 2018 becoming the second youngest brazilian currently serving one of his first actions was to organize a 48 member free market caucus to support guedes agenda but now that bolsonaro is in office kataguiri and his group have started criticizing the president when he violates their principles in april after bolsonaro threatened to cancel a planned hike in gas prices to appease the truck drivers union free brazil movement co founder renan santos compared him to former left wing president rousseff and called him a truck driver s bitch on twitter paranoid nationalism bolsonaro s inner circle has embraced the one aspect of libertarianism that overlaps with its own ethos opposition to socialism but the critique is articulated in the language of a paranoid right wing nationalism in august 2018 eduardo bolsonaro the president s son met with former donald trump adviser steve bannon in new york city announcing on twitter that they were joining forces to fight against cultural marxism after his father was elected eduardo became the south american representative of bannon s the movement a project to promote populism and a nationalist agenda the greatest brazilian philosopher alive according to eduardo is olavo de carvalho a pipe smoking septuagenarian who lectures on youtube about the alleged dangers of globalism feminism and islam and who once claimed that pepsi is sweetened with the cells of aborted fetuses carvalho who lives in virginia attended a dinner party at bannon s house in washington d c in january his host expressed concern that the face of chicago meaning guedes could derail the nationalist agenda in brazil carvalho reportedly denied that this would happen when bolsonaro made a trip to washington d c in march to meet with trump he attended a dinner at the brazilian embassy and was seated between bannon and carvalho bolsonaro s foreign affairs minister a position comparable to the american secretary of state is ernesto araújo a carvalho disciple who believes the current administration will reverse the spiritual corruption caused by a left wing agenda that includes gender ideology and the taking over of the catholic church by marxist ideology with its attendant promotion of birth control bolsonaro s first education minister was a carvalho recommendation ricardo vélez rodríguez who proposed an orwellian rewrite of school textbooks mandating that they refer to brazil s military dictatorship as a democratic regime of force after a disastrous three months bolsonaro replaced him with another carvalho recommendation conspiracy theorist abraham weintraub who has suggested that the introduction of crack cocaine in brazil was a left wing plot but the biggest threat to paulo guedes free market agenda according to the political scientist almeida might not be carvalho or araújo or bannon it s the industrialists of são paulo and the agriculturalists of mato grosso crony capitalists with an economic stake in protectionism and regulation who will wield influence in congress to resist his policies i m not sure how long paulo guedes will the defeats he ll endure in this government almeida says starting small bolsonaro is already demonstrating an unwillingness to risk political capital on meaningful reforms that hurt entrenched interests but there s cause for optimism that the new radicals in brasília the nation s capital city can cut red tape in significant ways in april the president signed a sweeping bill to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses it exempts companies engaged in low risk activities from licensing requirements mandates that the government establish deadlines for responding to permit requests and loosens the rules around initial public offerings among other things as a provisional decree it went into immediate effect but it will be invalidated if congress doesn t confirm it within 120 days many of the ministry of economy s initiatives don t require congressional approval for example attorney andré ramos a self described anarcho capitalist who now directs the department of business registry and integration has helped craft a proposal to make it easier to register a company in brazil further streamlining a process that was already improved dramatically by a digital government initiative predating bolsonaro in 2018 according to the world bank it took an average of 20 5 days to start a new business in the country way down from 82 5 days the prior year but there s a long distance to go in chile it takes just six days in a speech this year at the world economic forum in davos switzerland bolsonaro set the goal of moving brazil into the top 50 in the world bank s ease of doing business index over the next four years its current ranking is 109 out of 190 fulfilling that mandate falls largely to paulo uebel the ministry of economy s 40 year old special secretary of debureaucratization management and digital government who oversees a staff of 1 200 uebel who has held leadership positions at several libertarian think tanks says his goal is to simplify the lives of brazilians and to make the government stop micromanaging the life of the entrepreneur he s starting with the small stuff if reformers go up against powerful special interests right away uebel says we re probably going to lose kataguiri now in congress agrees we ll be able to approve some reforms but these groups are very powerful he says he expects small and medium successes but nothing of the magnitude that us liberals would like as an example of the sort of changes his team is starting with uebel says he wants to eliminate the rules governing the size and functionality of the punch clocks that private sector employers are required to use when tracking workers hours only two or three companies in brazil provide this kind of punch clock uebel says and they lack political clout more significant reforms such as eliminating controls on workers hours i e the restrictions that require a punch clock in the first place would require a constitutional amendment that is highly unlikely to pass right now uebel also plans to revise over a thousand federal procedures that currently require face to face meetings with government bureaucrats allowing brazilians to take care of more things online so what happens to the thousands of federal employees who would be replaced by websites if uebel gets his way they ll remain on the payroll because the authority to cut superfluous staff would require changing the constitution still uebel says he can thin the ranks through attrition theoretically the constitution does give the government authority to fire federal workers for poor performance but congress must first establish a legal framework for doing so the ministry of economy will be working with lawmakers to craft such a bill according to wagner lenhart an attorney and co author of a book about mises who is now the secretary of people management but legislation of this sort is sure to face enormous opposition from labor unions lenhart and costa who now heads brazil s federal school of public administration will also be pushing to substitute automatic promotion of government employees with a merit based system what next during the campaign bolsonaro deferred to guedes on most questions related to economic policy in truth i know nothing about the economy the president confessed to one reporter this is the difference between and trump says ling the guy who thinks he knows everything will never be a libertarian but a few months into his presidency bolsonaro is already overruling guedes for political expediency tariffs in brazil average 8 6 percent or 17 times the chilean rate in the world bank s 2019 doing business survey brazil ranked 106 out of 190 on trade across borders brazil s president has the authority to slash tariffs without congressional approval and in february his administration announced an agreement with mexico that liberalized the trade in light commercial automobiles but bolsonaro has also raised tariffs on powdered milk announcing on twitter that everyone has won in particular the consumers of brazil even before he was elected bolsonaro was citing the need for responsible trade and sympathizing with the difficulties that brazilian companies face broad tariff reductions seem unlikely guedes first major priority is to restructure brazil s fiscally insolvent pension system which because of an aging population is projected to consume a staggering 26 percent of gdp by 2050 standard poor s downgraded brazil s credit rating last year based on its failure to pass pension reform the system allows beneficiaries to retire at an average age of 58 and favors the better off the bottom 40 percent of the population gets just 18 percent of the paid benefits guedes and kataguiri are pushing for a unified system similar to chile s sistema previsional which would replace the current intergenerational ponzi scheme with an arrangement in which workers contribute to private savings accounts the government would still provide a baseline benefit for those who are too poor to contribute and current beneficiaries would be grandfathered into the old system but will it pass the negotiations underway in congress have been chaotic and in april kataguiri was losing faith my outlook for the future he told the new york times is that we won t approve the pension reform we will slip into a recession and the government will be left hemorrhaging kataguiri s souring outlook reflects the free brazil movement s shifting stance toward bolsonaro ferreira the group s co founder reflects on simpler times when the workers party was in power and the group could be purely oppositional explaining to its followers that left wing ideas were responsible for the crisis now that the group is publicly associated with the president it will be a public relations crisis for libertarians if his policies fail the left wing is going to come back at us says ferreira they could respond by pointing out that bolsonaro isn t really representative of their views but that s really hard convincing to do if guedes succeeds more broadly it could bring reductions in poverty and strong overall growth analogous to what the chicago boys engineered in chile but it will come at a cost the alliance that began three years ago on the initiative of winston ling desperate to save brazil from its worst economic crisis in modern history was instrumental in electing a populist president who is doing significant damage to civil liberties brazil needs economic freedom but it needs human rights too
is another recession real or imagined with fears rife over an imminent global economic recession experts have expressed mixed feelings on how it may affect nigeria s economy already suffering a lot of headwinds report ibrahim apekhade yusuf and medinat kanabe is nigeria immune from the impending global financial crisis as accentuated by the trade wars between the two major economic powers including the usa and china are the fears about a global meltdown as experienced a decade ago founded are there ominous signs the foregoing questions are some of the worries that have preoccupied the minds of well meaning nigerians in the last couple of days now indeed with the latent fears over another imminent global economic crunch many countries of the world are preparing ahead for any eventualities while analysts have expressed mixed reactions as to the extent to which the outcome of the trade wars can adversely affect nigeria they however did not foreclose the possibility clear and present danger over recession one man who should know better is the governor of central bank of nigeria cbn godwin emefiele he spoke of fears of another recession if measures are not put in place to combat the high rate of unemployment and other economic crisis emefiele gave this hint penultimate wednesday at the university of benin while delivering a lecture titled beyond the global financial crisis monetary policy under global uncertainty according to him monetary and fiscal policy authority must be ready to challenge the situation and begin to think of what can be done to tackle the situation the cbn governor said from some of my concluding remarks you may have observed whether you like it or not there is global uncertainty that will unfortunately most certainly lead to another crisis the question could be how are we as nigerians particularly our leaders i am talking of monetary and fiscal policy authority how are we preparing our country for the next set of crisis he said we have luckily exited recession we have seen inflation pending downward to about 18 72 percent in 2017 to about 11 37 percent today we see reserve moving up exchange rate stabilizing but unfortunately we still have issue and those issues bother on unemployment rate he assured that cbn will continue to take proactive approach in mitigating the likely adverse effects that may emanate from external headwinds while the cbn governor was rather downcast in his forecast the president of the association of bureaux de change operators of nigeria abcon alhaji aminu gwadabe at the weekend was optimistic that the country was not under any risk especially of a global recession as far as i m concerned there is really no cause for alarm the forex market has been relatively stable from what we can see the economic managers have got a solid rein on the workings of the economy the new government as just been sworn in and have since hit the ground running he assured going down memory lane the abcon boss said one of the factors that helped the country from exiting recession in the past was a single exchange rate for the market ensuring that naira should not be more than n400 to a dollar and this was one of the first thing we did as an association to checkmate the spike and the weakness of the naira also as stakeholders in the market we have helped the central bank of nigeria in ensuring that people have readily foreign exchange accessibility like you said our number is about 3 500 none of the banks even have up to 1000 outlets in the entire country in lagos alone we have about 1 700 bdcs so we are all over the place ensuring liquidity right now the market is even shocked up because the parallel market rate is below the rate we are buying from the cbn we are currently buying at n358 to the dollar for working customers that come some even n355 but we are going to the cbn window at n360 to a dollar so it is even becoming impossible for people to go to cbn window and come out and sale to make margin because of the parallel market rate is even far below the selling rate of the cbn to the bdc sub sector 2019 outlook in 2019 by broad consensus of global economic institutions the world economy will slow however the issue is where and by how much reporting on this the london based magazine the economist noted that economists at investment bank jp morgan developed their model based only on the historical predictive power of the stock market credit spreads and the yield curve this implies a probability of a recession in the united states in 2019 which could be as high as 91 according to economic watchers in nigeria a lot will depend on the condition of the international oil market if the global economy slumps oil prices will come under severe pressure and rising dollar would result in oil price decline besides the experts inferred that there are strong reasons to believe that monetary conditions will tighten in the year as cbn seeks to rein in liquidity just as there are concerns that this might not be adequate to refrain the naira from falling against major foreign currencies rising food prices from low harvests as a result of the herdsmen conflict and severe floods in 2018 and the implementation of the new minimum wage are expected to increase inflationary pressures during the year which could lead to tighter monetary policy recession is a possibility in the view of mr victor ndukauba deputy managing director afrinvest west africa limited the fear of global recession is not likely but a global slowdown in growth is certain under the circumstance while making oblique reference to the trade warfare between the usa and china ndukauba said the risk is possibly driven by the us the trade wars on one hand between the us and china fighting over you know the trade balance and trade deficit and more recently the conflict between mexico and canada so i think that s the real threat to global slowdown because between the us and china these are the two countries that are responsible for nearly 40 of all trade flows and perhaps even more in terms of the global gdp on whether the risk of the global slowdown in growth is sufficient to push the global economy into a recession he said it is a possibility that might be possible but i think if you follow the top global issues though the more critical thing for us is still the domestic challenges confronting us daily raising some posers the afrinvest boss said what is the risk of the slow down on all titles positive or negative and how do we put that side by side the expectations for the conflict in the middle east and how long will the escalation in iran and the us versus north korea last for me issues are even more fundamental and they are more domestic than external while attempting a prognosis of the issues bedeviling the nation s fledging economy he said growth is at 2 or thereabouts and the security growth is very weak at 2 where our population is still growing at 2 6 2 7 so that is part of the problem with respect to an expansion in poverty what drives growth in nigeria is not so much what happens on the external sector and the best you can have is oils prices is still where it was last year which is at an average of 70 barrel or more but even with that we saw that revenue underperformed by 45 so unless something significant happens in terms of output significant output in oil volumes and that oil prices stay high we are still going to struggle in respect to revenue and there is only so much you can flog in terms of trying to get the economy to swipe as we produce the taxes pressed further he said some of the issues are more domestic than external as a government we need to look at i think the focus now has to be more on growth because that is where the real need is unemployment indices is a disaster at 26 or thereabout so we really need to address the issues and even those external developments are always the key risk factor but i think regardless we still have good examples we can draw from in africa ethiopia is doing maybe 10 and rwanda is doing something similar so i think there are pockets of excellence even despite the global headwinds as far as i m concerned there are very clear and present dangers really of a possible recession by the way a recession is officially described as two successive regimes of negative gdp flow so if you see a contraction then there is a problem when you look at the 2 gdp growth there is only really one sector that made the difference and that is the telecoms ict attracted about at 10 gdp growth every other sector hardly posed such impressive outcomes at 6 and services was more or less negative manufacturing was down those are the issues really confronting us at this point in time how usa china trade war will aid global recession there are worries that a further escalation of the trade war between the united states and china could drag the world economy into a recession according to janus henderson investors this is a potential for a near term very painful escalation of the trade tensions which could weigh on the tech sector and slow global growth said richard clode a portfolio manager on the global technology team at janus henderson i m worried about the trade war clode said at a media round table on disruption and sustainable investing in hong kong rising protectionism 25 per cent tariffs on chinese goods is going to have huge implications for the global economy and could ultimately bring us into a recession
president trump s plan to slap new tariffs on mexican imports weeks after escalating his trade war with china leaves the united states fighting a multi front campaign that threatens more instability for manufacturers consumers and the global economy the president s bombshell announcement that he would impose 5 percent tariffs on mexican imports with the possibility of raising them to 25 percent if mexico does not stop migrants from crossing into the united states left some economists fearing there were few limits to trump s appetite for trade conflict in our view if the u s is willing to impose tariff and non tariff barriers on china and mexico then the bar for tariffs on other important u s trading partners including europe may be lower than we previously thought barclays economists

manufacture so far few have reported returning production to the united states despite the president s stated aim of using trade policy to help bring jobs back home many are still seeking alternative locations overseas where labor is cheaper trump said he would impose the new tariffs because the mexican government was not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants many of whom travel through mexico from central america some white house officials who support trump s approach believe the threat of tariffs is the only way to get the attention of mexican leaders advertisement the mexican government

tariffs imposed by president donald trump during 2018 cost the u s economy 6 9 billion last year above and beyond the 12 3 billion paid by american consumers and importers to the federal government that s the conclusion of a new economic analysis of the trump trade war published this week by centre for economic policy research a london based think tank by a trio of economists from the federal reserve bank of new york princeton university and columbia university the paper draws an important but sometimes ignored distinction between the cost of the tariffs as a form of taxation and the broader economic effects of raising barriers to trade americans are paying both those seen costs in the form of higher taxes as well as the unseen spillover costs known as deadweight loss in economist lingo created by the tariffs by the end of last year after ramping up tariffs over the course of several months the deadweight loss of trump s tariffs totaled 1 4 billion each month according to mary amiti stephen j redding and david weinstein the three researchers we find that the u s tariffs were almost completely passed through into u s domestic prices so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers they concluded evidence of broader negative economic consequences of the tariffs blows a major hole in the trump administration s big three economic arguments for its protectionist trade policies first trump has argued that the tariffs benefit the u s government because they are generating revenue that could be used to close the budget deficit this is technically correct because tariff revenue does flow into the u s treasury but the billions generated by the trade war has not slowed the growth of the federal budget defict in any case if the tariffs are draining 1 4 billion out of the economy every month beyond the cost of the taxes paid by u s importers it becomes even more of a stretch for trump to claim that the tariffs are benefiting the country its economy or the federal government our results imply that the tariff revenue the u s is now collecting is insufficient to compensate the losses being born by the consumers of imports the researchers conclude the second argument trump has made for the tariffs is that they are needed to create leverage on other nations in order to negotiate better trade deals trump has explicitly credited the tariffs with helping negotiate the new united states mexico canada agreement usmca a more protectionist replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta and has made it obvious that he believes tariffs on chinese goods will pave the way to a new trade deal with china but amiti redding and weinstein found little evidence of such an improvement in the terms of trade one of the main points of contention in the trump administration s efforts to reach a trade deal with china has been the supposed theft of u s intellectual property by chinese firms but even if a future trade deal resulted in the chinese paying an additional 25 percent in royalties for u s intellectual property it would take three years of payments to make up for the damage inflicted on u s companies by the first 11 months of trump s trade war finally trump has claimed that tariffs will help resurrect american manufacturing jobs and prevent further offshoring of blue collar work to cheaper labor markets in mexico china and elsewhere but even if the trade war could bring back 35 400 manufacturing jobs equal to the number of american steel and aluminum producing jobs lost in the past decade the deadweight loss to the economy would be about 195 000 per job which is almost four times more than the annual wage of a steel worker the trio concludes an economic white paper is unlikely to sway trump s opinion about tariffs he s the tariff man after all but this analysis is the most comprehensive summary yet of the ongoing costs of the white house s misguided protectionism more than a year after trump assured americans that his trade war would be good and easy to win the data strongly suggest otherwise

dispatch his top diplomat to washington for talks seeking to head off the proposed tariffs obrador said mexico won t panic over the threatened hike but economists and those whose livelihoods depend on the trade relationship worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year worry that stiff duties could have dramatic negative consequences and potentially spark a trade war between the neighboring countries already esquer and other exporters were having to contend with a 17 56 tariff on tomatoes imposed after washington announced in march it was ending a longstanding agreement over alleged mexican dumping of the fruit if the new duties do take effect esquer is looking at another 5 being slapped on his products potentially increasing to 25 in subsequent months unless mexico does more to stop illegal migration through its territory by a june 10 deadline per trump s demand right now more than anything there is a reaction of disbelief with everything that is going on esquer who s been sending tomatoes and other crops to the united states for 60 years told the associated press by phone during a break in the meetings it also goes against the spirit there is between both countries the agreements we have the bilateral trade we have which is very successful esquer continued on the other hand we ll have to wait for the reaction of u s exporters to mexico because they are also going to see their exports threatened if mexico launches some kind of mirror policy from berries and automobiles to machinery and household appliances all of mexico s exports stand to be hit with the tariffs avocado growers in michoacan electronics factory workers in tamaulipas across the border from texas auto parts exporters all would feel the pinch esquer who does business from the tomato growing northwestern state of sinaloa said it s not just businessmen who stand to lose since mexico s estimated 700 tomato exporters are responsible for directly generating some 450 000 jobs according to mexico s agriculture department last year some 2 billion in tomatoes were exported to the united states second only to tequila and ahead of avocados the threat also throws into question the future of the usmca trade deal between the u s mexico and canada hammered out in months of contentious negotiations as a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s most touted achievements trump s threat came the same day mexico announced it would begin the process of ratifying the usmca and less than two weeks after it successfully negotiated the lifting of u s steel and aluminum tariffs that had been a roadblock to final approval for the trade deal it would really have a terrible impact on our producers and our exporters said kenneth smith ramos who led then president enrique peña nieto s delegation to usmca talks and is now an international trade consultant at mexico city based agon and it would hurt u s producers as well because they rely a lot on mexican inputs for their production he added so it would reduce their competitiveness and force them to raise prices which would ultimately of course hit consumers that means people like chuck sholtis ceo of el paso texas based plastic molding technology inc which employs 100 people most of its business involves plastic injection molding for automotive electronics and business products for maquiladoras factories in mexico that are run by foreign companies sholtis said his company has already suffered from u s steel tariffs on china that increased the costs of their tools and it s also been hit by slowdowns at ports of entry sholtis said the united states has found a niche in high tech specialized manufacturing that s part of a global supply chain he fears that if more tariffs like this are implemented or if the usmca doesn t take effect the united states will lose its edge in manufacturing he s also worried about possible recession in mexico and the united states it s illogical sholtis said tariffs go against one of the stated goals of the administration to help manufacturing and thereby create high skilled manufacturing jobs the economic impact for mexico was swift with the peso down more than 3 against the u s dollar today u s stocks likewise tumbled on wall street initial macroeconomic projections from economists were also chilling analyst alfredo coutiño of moody s analytics said mexican exports to the u s totaled 358 billion last year or 80 of all goods the country sold overseas over the course of a year he said a 5 tariff would represent about 18 billion in damage or 1 5 of mexico s gdp while a 25 tariff would amount to 90 billion or 7 3 of gdp banco base estimated that a 5 tariff could knock 2 85 percentage points off growth of mexico s exports but said a weaker peso would help compensate such tariffs would likely push mexico into a recession as well as disrupt regional supply chains and hurt investor confidence oxford economics economist gregory daco wrote in a report coutiño said mexico could impose retaliatory penalties sparking a tariff war a second less aggressive but potentially more effective option would be to allow the peso to depreciate to the point where the tariffs would be neutralized he added via twitter trump argued that mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done mexico already has implemented policies and actions to discourage irregular migration last month it raided the latest caravan of mostly central american migrants traveling through the southern state of chiapas arresting hundreds and effectively breaking it up there have been no significant caravans since then with many migrants saying they now fear to travel in large groups mexico also has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more with seemingly endless waits for permits that would allow them to travel legally through the country but sealing its porous southern border with guatemala is probably impossible because mexico lacks sufficient infrastructure to completely patrol a frontier that includes a river passing through dense jungle we are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy lópez obrador said this morning while making no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly central american immigrants transiting mexico to reach the u s border we have to help so that they don t enter the united states illegally but we also have to do it respecting human rights said lópez obrador nothing authoritarian they re human beings lópez obrador espouses a longer term holistic approach focused on improving security development and economic opportunity in the migrants countries of origin especially honduras guatemala and el salvador for now lópez obrador is betting on diplomacy and dialogue foreign relations secretary marcelo ebrard announced talks would take place next wednesday in washington with him and u s secretary of state mike pompeo leading their respective nations delegations there is a disposition for dialogue ebrard tweeted we will be firm and we will defend the dignity of mexico in ciudad juarez across from el paso texas 21 year old jennifer del carmen pérez hernández said she moved there three years ago because she couldn t find work in her home state of veracruz on the gulf coast pérez said when she first arrived she was told that if trump were elected staff cuts might be possible she s kept her job operates an upholstery machine specialized for cars so far but the tariff threat gives her new cause for concern i ve worked in sewing the three years that i ve been in juarez it s what i know pérez said if there are cuts and i have to find work elsewhere i would start at zero
swift s latin american regional conference larc explored how banks in the region are looking to increase digitisation while managing cyber and compliance challenges ignacio blanco head of latin america the caribbean at swift opened larc by noting that customer demands from financial services have rapidly increased in the digital world with organisations operating in a world that is hyper connected financial institutions need to evolve from market leaders to digital leaders he said this was supported by an audience poll that asked delegates to think about the main driver for digital transformation in their organisation with business model adaptation 32 and meeting customer expectations 31 being selected as the key drivers accelerating digital transformation as to how banks are approaching this challenge kartikeya swami associate partner at mckinsey company described how they are deploying systems and tools to drive products with an agile test and learn approach developing solutions and getting them out to customers for testing as quickly as possible taking on feedback updating the solution and sending it out for more feedback thinking about what it takes to successfully support the acceleration of digital transformation christopher mager ctp managing director digital office at bny mellon treasury services said that two years ago his institution had moved to pursue a more centralised strategy by creating an enterprise level digital group their clients often hold relationships with a number of the bank s businesses across the world he said so this enterprise view was helpful to provide a seamless approach as part of this process bny mellon created a digital council that has representatives from all the different business groups and key stakeholders while each business within the group should prioritise its own developments there are certain functions that every business undertakes such as onboarding clients or providing reporting for example this is where the digital council and enterprise approach has its focus mager said helping the business structure its data across the enterprise and avoiding duplicating costs kasif wadiwala associate partner at deloitte consulting reinforced the point that financial institutions need a bank wide digital strategy in order to bring all businesses along on the digitisation journey at the same time he added that banks need to understand what their business process rules are and how they manage technological investments before jumping into digitisation projects commenting on his own bank george doolittle executive vice president and head of global payments services corporate investment banking at wells fargo said they realised they had centralised innovation too much and needed to get the various business lines more involved in the process the business lines have the customer connection which is key in developing solutions that actually solve customer needs when it comes to payments for example customers want a fast effective and secure experience this point was raised by beatriz quevedo uman a regional head of client management global liquidity and cash management latin america for hsbc who noted that this need is the same for consumers and businesses alike mo nica garci a luzio vice president of finance at banco bisa added that corporates need more information around their payments which is why her bank had added support for swift gpi last year a question from the audience on day 1 of larc asked about how banks can go about balancing digital innovation with cyber security and regulatory requirements bny mellon s mager responded by saying that his team works closely with business partners on the digital council so that legal and compliance teams at the bank have an input on the bank s innovations it is important to get all key stakeholders on board before investing in and working on innovation in order to address any particular issues before time and resources are spent on a project facing cyber challenges the threat that banks face from cyber criminals was highlighted by swami who commented that 25 7 of all malware attacks in 2018 hit banks and other financial services organisations cyber actors will attempt to infiltrate a local system via a phishing attack a compromised security token or similar pat antonacci head of customer experience at swift explained they would then look to move large volumes of funds over weekends or holidays for example while banks smartened up to this approach and would monitor for these sorts of attacks fraudsters will now try to withdraw smaller but more numerous amounts during weekdays julian dana director of latin america for mandiant at fireeye made the point that advanced persistent threats apts are one group of cyber actors to pay particular attention to today these groups can often be government sponsored apts from countries such as north korea have evolved he noted from acting like hacktivists to now looking for financial gain as a way around economic sanctions ransomware like wannacry is an example of this apts have local contacts to support attacks who can help with reverse engineering to generate an insider threat adam bulava executive director of attack simulation with jp morgan added that the us financial sector has developed cyber response guides across the community to help address cyber threats the more that banks run through these eventualities the better they will be able to respond to a real attack the human element in combating cyber crime was highlighted by carmen zegarra digital crimes unit attorney for microsoft she said that people may have their password underneath their keyboard use basic passwords or use the same password on their company computer that they use on their mobile phone she stressed that organisation wide education is critical to build awareness nine out of ten people will click on a phishing link so the business needs to understand that fighting cyber crime is everyone s responsibility bulava said that jp morgan regularly carries out phishing tests across all of their employees in a move designed to further awareness and to protect the business he added that the bank has a red team of ethical hackers who will attack the bank s environment to try and gain access to data or accounts this can highlight where previously unknown vulnerabilities exist in the bank s infrastructure delegates had a chance to see skylar simmons from swift s own red team carry out a live hack on the second day of larc 2019 simmons showed how a methodical approach could allow a hacker to find a bank s ip address relatively easily see which ports of the bank s ip addresses are open and target the information they could uncover to quickly gain access to the bank s servers using a variety of tools that are easily available online in the hack simmons was able to download sensitive files from the bank s server he also found that the bank had written its own programme to send mt103 messages without using swift interfaces while the system was set up to only allow authorised users to send payment messages having compromised the system the hacker can start checking what security measures exist and bypass these quickly sending tens of millions of dollars to his own accounts the speed at which simmons was able to demonstrate a hacker s attempt to gain access to a bank s core systems provided plenty of food for thought for attending delegates keeping up with compliance as well as balancing an innovative digital agenda with managing the cyber threats banks also need to be able to keep up with the compliance demands they face speaking to this point on the second day of larc sandra depoalo managing director and global head of aml with bny mellon said that the compliance team needs to engage with the business team in a bank to understand new clients before the onboarding process begins she said that aml compliance in the bank could call a similar person in the potential client organisation at the start of this process for example depoalo added that it is important to find out if correspondent banks have similar controls in place if a bank is making repeated requests for information that go unanswered from its correspondent red flags can be quickly raised maristella aldana sanin chief compliance officer at bancolombia agreed with the need for compliance to be close to the business compliance programmes need to be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they share the ethical principles of the organisation as well as the regulatory rules in compliance she added that they are also trying to improve the customer experience by being as agile and efficient as possible by using new technologies such as bots to scan for suspicious operations and comparing customers with a pool of peers for example corporate governance is critical to ensuring that compliance is understood across the whole organisation carlos e troetsch partner and executive vice president at mmg bank president of felaban said that this allows institutions to be proactive rather than reactive and it should be integrated into a bank s risk programme speaking to different banks in other regions also helps support the understanding of compliance in a bank beneficial ownership was named as the biggest compliance challenge globally by james h freis jr chief compliance officer and managing director at deutsche bo rse group the question is who is behind the corporate entity he said what is the nature of the corporate business and where are the funds coming from while it can be difficult to address beneficial ownership freis said that if it is done right it could create a level playing field across all countries collaboration and innovation to create common standards such as the swift kyc registry help in this regard he added regional considerations the issue of corruption and compliance is clearly top of mind for financial institutions in latin america a poll of delegates showed 69 believe that the biggest concern for latin america today is corruption and its impact on foreign direct investment fdi claudio irigoyen managing director head of latin america economics and foreign exchange fixed income strategy at bank of america merrill lynch commented that this issue has certainly been very important in different national elections in latin america in the past couple of years he did add however that the elephant in the room with regard to fdi is the possibility of us china trade wars on that topic humberto lo pez director of strategy and operations for latin america with the world bank observed a split in latin america noting how the northern part of the region looks to the us while the southern part of region looks to china he added that interest rates in the us could be a concern for companies in latin america with high levels of debt looking at where opportunities exist in the continent irigoyen mentioned brazil saying that expectations have adjusted significantly since the most recent presidential election with the reform bill in brazil expected to be passed by q3 2019 and additionally a market friendly government being elected in argentina there are good economic news stories in the region he said margaret myers director of the asia latin america program inter american dialogue highlighted softbank s us 5bn technology growth fund for start ups which could help to promote growth in the region she added that the advancement of 5g across the region offered the prospect of development in industries such as agriculture and mining in closing larc 2019 swift s ignacio blanco drew attention to the variety of opportunities for banks to accelerate digital transformation in latin america that had been discussed at the conference he concluded by saying that this transformation needs collaboration and it is critical that institutions foster a culture that supports this
u s president donald trump has once again turned to tariffs to try to get his way with a u s trading partner this time the target is mexico trump plans to impose five per cent tariffs on mexican imports starting june 10 and to ratchet them up to 25 per cent by oct 1 if the mexicans don t do more to stop the surge of central american migrants across the southern u s border tariffs have become one of trump s favourite policy tools the president who calls himself a tariff man has slapped the levies on imported steel aluminum dishwashers and solar panels he s also imposed them on 250 billion worth of chinese goods in a dispute over china s aggressive campaign to challenge american technological dominance and he s planning to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese imports that he hasn t already targeted story continues below advertisement before trump tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries when nations tended to focus on keeping imports out and exporting as much as they could more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s watch the auto sector may be impacted most by mexico tariffs 2 23 the auto sector may be impacted most by mexico tariffs here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ q is the u s in a trade war economists have no set definition of a trade war but with the world s two largest economies now slapping potentially punishing tariffs on each other it looks as if a trade war has arrived all told trump has threatened to hit as much as 550 billion worth of china s exports to the u s with punitive tariffs that s more than the 506 billion in goods that china shipped to the united states last year story continues below advertisement it s not uncommon for countries even close allies to fight over trade in specific products the united states and canada for example have squabbled for decades over softwood lumber but the u s and china are fighting over much broader issues like china s requirements that american companies share advanced technology to access china s market and the overall u s trade deficit with china so far neither side has shown any sign of bending breaking news from canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens ___ q so what are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they re typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller in the united states tariffs also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 per cent to parachutes three per cent watch conway cites meeting with trudeau as proof usmca can be ratified 1 29 conway cites meeting with trudeau as proof usmca can be ratified sometimes the u s will impose additional duties on foreign imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies story continues below advertisement ___ q do other countries have higher tariffs than the united states most key u s trading partners do not have significantly higher average tariffs according to an analysis by greg daco at oxford economics u s tariffs on imported goods adjusted for trade volumes average 2 4 per cent above japan s two per cent and just below the three per cent for the european union and 3 1 per cent for canada the comparable figures for mexico and china are higher both have higher duties that top four per cent trump has complained about the 270 per cent duty that canada imposes on dairy products but the united states has its own ultra high tariffs 168 per cent on peanuts and 350 per cent on tobacco ___ q what are tariffs supposed to accomplish two things raise government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the establishment of the federal income tax in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for the u s government from 1790 to 1860 for example they produced 90 per cent of federal revenue according to clashing over commerce a history of us trade policy by douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast last year tariffs accounted for only about one per cent of federal revenue story continues below advertisement in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the u s government collected 34 6 billion in customs duties and fees the white house office of management and budget expects tariffs to fetch 40 4 billion this year watch white house says trump s mexico tariff threat is about national security 1 01 white house says trump s mexico tariff threat is about national security tariffs also are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive they also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices tariffs fell out of favour as global trade expanded after world war ii the formation of the world trade organization and the advent of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement among the u s mexico and canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether story continues below advertisement ___ q why are tariffs making a comeback after years of trade agreements that bound the countries of the world more closely and erased restrictions on trade a populist backlash has grown against globalization this was evident in trump s 2016 election and the british vote that year to leave the european union both surprise setbacks for the free trade establishment critics note that big corporations in rich countries exploited looser rules to move factories to china and other low wage countries then shipped goods back to their wealthy home countries while paying low tariffs or none at all since china joined the wto in 2001 the united states has shed 3 1 million factory jobs though many economists attribute much of that loss not just to trade but to robots and other technologies that replace human workers trump campaigned on a pledge to rewrite trade agreements and crack down on china mexico and other countries he blames what he calls their abusive trade policies for america s persistent trade deficits 566 billion last year most economists by contrast say the deficit simply reflects the reality that the united states spends more than it saves by imposing tariffs he is beginning to turn his hard line campaign rhetoric into action story continues below advertisement watch white house says mexico has not done enough on migration 2 25 white house says mexico has not done enough on migration ___ q are tariffs a wise policy most economists trump s trade adviser peter navarro is a notable exception say no the tariffs drive up the cost of imports and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise their prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported components some u s companies that buy steel are complaining that trump s tariffs put them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer their products at lower prices story continues below advertisement more broadly economists say trade restrictions make the economy less efficient facing less competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best
ian angus edits the website climate and capitalism and is the author most recently of a redder shade of green intersections of science and socialism monthly review press 2017 he would like to thank john bellamy foster fred magdoff michael friedman lis angus and two anonymous scientific reviewers for their assistance with this article while i was writing this article the press reported a maternity hospital in romania shut down because thirty nine newborns were infected by a drug resistant superbug eleven staff members were found to be carriers in gaza the wounds of thousands of palestinians shot by israeli soldiers are infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria and the blockade prevents necessary medical supplies from reaching them in pakistan in the past two years over five thousand people have contracted a strain of typhoid fever that is resistant to all recommended antibiotics in an indian hospital a new strain of the common bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae described as both multidrug resistant and hypervirulent killed more than half of the patients who contracted it described as both multidrug resistant and hypervirulent killed more than half of the patients who contracted it tests found that 56 percent of staphylococcus bacteria in two afghan hospitals are resistant to multiple antibiotics scarcely a day passes without more news of people contracting infections or infectious diseases that cannot be cured by the strongest medicines available antimicrobial resistance amr is a global health crisis driven by a pharmaceutical and health care system that puts profit before people in addition to devastating climate change the anthropocene may be defined by epidemics that medicine cannot cure a ticking time bomb in 1876 frederick engels wrote let us not however flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature for each such victory nature takes its revenge on us each victory it is true in the first place brings about the results we expected but in the second and third places it has quite different unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first 1 sarah otto may never have read engels but the director of the biodiversity research centre at the university of british columbia echoed him in 2018 with the evolution of antibiotic resistance humans may impose selection but we will often not retain the upper hand 2 keywords microbe and microorganism are umbrella terms for microscopic organisms including bacteria viruses archaea and some fungi bacteria are single celled organisms that do not have a structured nucleus pathogens are bacteria that can cause disease viruses are very small parasites that can only grow or reproduce by infecting a living cell antimicrobial and antibiotic are often used interchangeably but properly speaking antimicrobial includes all chemicals that attack microbes while antibiotic refers specifically to medicines that only attack bacteria a widely used test developed by bacteriologist hans gram divides bacteria into two broad classes gram negative and gram positive the former are naturally more resistant to antibiotics because their cell walls are less permeable engels would certainly have considered the discovery of antibiotics as one of the greatest of human victories over nature diseases that had shortened human lives for millennia were defeated wounds and infections that had almost always been fatal were cured in hours the ultimate triumph of medicine the end of all disease seemed about to arrive but now the world health organization who says we face a problem so serious that it threatens the achievements of modern medicine 3 england s chief medical officer professor sally davies calls it a ticking time bomb not only for the uk but also for the world arguably as important as climate change 4 nature s revenge the unforeseen result that cancels the first is upon us miracle drugs are losing their magic an end to modern medicine like most scientific breakthroughs in the twentieth century antibiotic drugs were developed for war alexander fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 when an unknown fungus killed bacteria in a dish in his lab but it remained a scientific curiosity until the early 1940s when howard florey and ernst chain at oxford university showed its practical medicinal value and the u s government decided that a drug that could save injured soldiers might help win the war several pharmaceutical companies were well paid to develop techniques for mass production and penicillin was introduced for battlefield use late in 1942 for the united states and its allies the second world war was the first major conflict in which infections did not cause the majority of amputations and fatalities 5 after the war when penicillin became generally available it was hailed as the miraculous beginning of a new era in human health in 1948 bacteriologist mary barber wrote that penicillin was already regarded by many in the nature of a charm the mere sight of which was sufficient to make all bacteria tremble 6 if some bacteria did not succumb to penicillin they fell to newer antibiotics and more magic bullets were on the way many experts predicted the imminent conquest of disease but nature always bats last resistance to penicillin which appeared on a limited scale in the 1940s became a worldwide problem in the 1950s newer antibiotics quickly lost their power as well tetracycline arrived in 1948 and resistance was nibbling at its effectiveness before the 1950s ended erythromycin was discovered in 1952 and erythromycin resistance arrived in 1955 methicillin a lab synthesized relative of penicillin was developed in 1960 specifically to counter penicillin resistance yet within a year staph bacteria developed defenses against it as well earning the bug the name mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus after mrsa there were the esbls extended spectrum beta lactamases which defeated not only penicillin and its relatives but also a large family of antibiotics called cephalosporins and after cephalosporins were undermined new antibiotics were achieved and lost in turn 7 bacteria are the oldest and most numerous organisms on earth no one knows how many there are but a good estimate is five times 1030 more than the number of stars in the universe in addition to about thirty trillion human cells your body contains some thirty nine trillion bacteria most of which provide metabolic services that you literally could not live without a few about one hundred species can cause serious illnesses if they get into your blood antibiotics kill bacteria or stop them from reproducing and if they work properly they attack the disease causing pathogens without damaging too many of the bacteria you actually need the history of antibiotics is often described as a biochemical arms race bacteria develop immunity to existing drugs scientists develop new drugs bacteria evolve again and so on that cycle continued for a few decades until science fell behind over one hundred different antibiotics were developed and introduced in the 1950s and 1960s but the last major additions to the arsenal were made in the 1980s development slowed markedly in the 1990s and fell off a cliff after 2000 the few antibiotics introduced in this century are basically variations on past themes most drugmakers have pulled out of the race entirely eliminating antibiotic research and development in favor of more lucrative drugs 8 meanwhile antibiotic resistance continues to spread the promise of a world without disease has been replaced by warnings of evermore virulent pathogens created by the very drugs that were supposed to save us drug resistant infections are now the third leading cause of death in the united states killing an estimated 162 thousand people a year 9 the toll is far higher in africa asia and latin america the case of mrsa the ability of bacteria to overcome antibiotics has been well demonstrated by a member of the staphylococcus family first identified in 1889 staphylococcus cells live by the millions in the nostrils and on the skin of about 30 percent of the population normally they are harmless but if they get into your blood or gut they can cause illnesses ranging from minor skin infections to life threatening heart disease of the dozen or so varieties staphylococcus aureus is particularly virulent it can cause pneumonia heart failure toxic shock syndrome bacteremia sepsis and other serious diseases it is also particularly good at defending itself until the 1940s most s aureus infections were fatal penicillin was effective against it until the mid 1950s when hospitals reported resistance and research showed that the bacteria had learned to produce penicillinase an enzyme that disables the antibiotic by the late 1960s penicillin no longer worked on about 80 percent of all identified s aureus infections methicillin introduced in 1960 was specifically designed to fight s aureus but within a year hospitals in britain found a more deadly strain of s aureus that methicillin could not stop methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa spread through hospitals across europe in the 1960s reaching north america by the end of the decade by the 1990s it was in almost every country and had developed resistance to many antibiotics becoming one of the most widespread and deadly superbugs initially found only in hospitals mrsa infections are now more often contracted in the community the infectious diseases society says that mrsa kills more people in the united states each year than emphysema hiv aids parkinson s disease and homicide combined an expert panel appointed by the british government has warned that if present trends continue by 2050 the global death rate due to antibiotic resistance will be ten million a year 10 that is a death every three seconds more than the combined total from cancer and diabetes the potential death toll from incurable infection is frightening but the threat goes beyond that as michael osterholm director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota writes if antibiotics do not work then many medical procedures that rely on them will no longer be safe without effective and nontoxic antibiotics to control infection any surgery becomes inherently dangerous so all but the most critical lifesaving procedures would be complex risk benefit decisions you d have a hard time doing open heart surgery organ transplants or joint replacements and there would be no more in vitro fertilization caesarian delivery would be far more risky cancer chemotherapy would take a giant step backward as would neonatal and regular intensive care for that matter no one would go to a hospital unless they absolutely had to because of all the germs on the floors and other surfaces and floating around in the air rheumatic fever would have lifelong consequences tb sanitaria could be back in business you could just about do a postapocalyptic sci fi movie on the subject 11 margaret chan former director of who summarizes a post antibiotic era means in effect an end to modern medicine as we know it 12 how close is that future until recently the most dangerous category of bacteria was multidrug resistant recently who added extensively drug resistant now some researchers unofficially describe certain bacteria as totally drug resistant 13 no wonder who calls a postantibiotic era a real possibility for the 21st century 14 this article focuses on resistance to antibiotics but similar problems are developing with antifungal and antiviral medicines the risk is not evenly distributed in 2010 carlos franco paredes and jose ignacio santos preciado wrote while it is recognized that the burden of antimicrobial resistance represents a significant threat to the health care costs and clinical outcomes of infectious diseases in resource rich countries the impact on resource poor countries has been shown to be devastating 15 it is a law of life under capitalism that social problems in the global north are crises in the global south that social crises in the north are catastrophes in the south this is increasingly true in the anthropocene when the impacts of higher temperatures violent storms and rising sea levels are particularly severe in the poorest countries and disproportionately harm poor people everywhere amr proves the law again as the authors of a who report on infectious disease say biologically we are all at risk but the risk is not evenly distributed 16 when researchers predicted that by 2050 ten million people a year will die from untreatable infections their calculation included more than eight million deaths in asia and africa diseases that antibiotics have largely controlled in the north including tuberculosis and cholera are not only epidemic in the south but they have also mutated into much harder to treat forms worldwide 1 6 million die each year from tuberculosis making it the leading cause of death from infectious disease there are 10 million new cases each year and 450 thousand of those are drug resistant thirty countries account for more than 85 percent of all cases of tuberculosis and all but two russian federation and brazil are in africa or south southeast asia in the rich countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd 17 percent of bacterial infections are resistant to some antibiotics now that is bad news but most antibiotics still work most of the time and alternatives are usually available if you live in the global north and have strep throat or an infected injury an antibiotic can probably cure it but as the oecd s 2018 report stemming the superbug tide remarks the odds are much worse if you live in a poorer country in low and middle income countries resistance is already high and amr is projected to grow more rapidly than in oecd countries for example in indonesia brazil and the russian federation between 40 and 60 of infections are already resistant compared to an average of 17 in oecd countries in the same countries growth of amr rates is forecast to be 4 to 7 times faster than growth in oecd countries between now and 2030 such high resistance rates in health care systems which are already weakened by constrained budgets will create the conditions for an enormous death toll that will be mainly borne by new borns very young children and the elderly population 17 carlos f amábile cuevas the internationally recognized authority on antibiotic resistance who heads mexico s fundación lusara explains why the crisis is so much more severe in the south infectious diseases are much more common here as poor sanitary and work safety conditions starvation and malnutrition lack of medical services and an excess of alternative medicine options and larger exposure to environmental agents that increase the likelihood of infection e g weather changes arthropod vectors affect much more and a much larger fraction of the population than in developed countries conditions are only likely to get worse as the divide between rich and poor countries widens as it does between rich and poor people within poor countries and also as climate change war and migration introduce entirely new variables to systems that were in an equilibrium of sorts for many years 18 two factors came together to create the amr crisis the spectacular ability of bacteria to adapt to threats and a pharmaceutical industry whose primary concern is maximizing sales and profits unprecedented in the history of evolution the famous maxim of geneticist theodosius dobzhansky nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution is absolutely true of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance 19 despite the reluctance of medical journals and the popular press to use the e word amr is evolution in overdrive 20 bacteria lack the complex internal structures that characterize the cells of fungi plants and animals but that does not mean that these single celled organisms are simple rather than growing physically bigger and more structured bacteria have evolved as masters of biochemistry they have survived for billions of years by inventing an extraordinary range of metabolic processes that detect consume block transform and produce chemicals of all kinds they constantly modify and manipulate the world around them and they evolve quickly when faced with new challenges what has been called the high evolutionary potential of bacteria and their enormous potential for adaptation has enabled them to colonize every imaginable ecological niche high in the atmosphere on the ocean floor deep in the earth s crust 21 some species thrive in the hottest geysers while others live in arctic ice or stomach acid or oil wells or radioactive waste some even live by eating antibiotics according to orthodox evolutionary theory new traits can appear when an organism s dna is incorrectly copied during reproduction if the mutant offspring are better able to survive and reproduce natural selection will preserve the trait and eventually those with the new dna will outnumber those without it bacterial populations number in the trillions and each cell can divide in as little as twenty minutes so bacteria can change and adapt to new circumstances far more rapidly than plants animals and other multicellular organisms 22 in the 10 days a fruit fly takes to reproduce 720 new generations of e coli are born in your gut that is how some antibiotic resistance emerges but it does not explain the improbably rapid evolution of bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs including antibiotics they have never been exposed to this is a result of a different adaptive process that biologists discovered in the 1950s and 1960s bacteria do not only inherit dna from their parents but they can also acquire it directly from other bacteria in what is called horizontal or lateral gene transfer hgt in addition to inventing new resistance genes bacteria can acquire existing ones in ready made batches from other cells over hundreds of millions of years every type of bacteria not just the few species that can harm humans has fought the biochemical poisons it encountered in its environments and natural selection favored the winners those that failed disappeared those that succeeded incorporated new genes in their genomes as the scars of the natural history of bacteria and the diversity of toxic molecules that they have encountered including antibiotics 23 many of those genes are found in plasmids free floating loops of dna that are part of each cell s genome but separate from its chromosome each plasmid carries between three and three hundred different genes and each bacterium may host many different plasmids 24 the most common form of hgt involves plasmids moving from one bacterium to another even between species carrying new traits to the recipient cell such exchanges occur more frequently when the population is under attack by antibiotics increasing each cell s chance of acquiring resistance genes since each plasmid can contain several different resistance genes a bacterium that acquires resistance to the currently threatening antibiotic may also as a side effect acquire resistance to others 25 the ease and frequency with which bacteria exchange dna leads some scientists to question whether the concept of species is appropriate for microbes as stuart b levy director of the center for genetic adaptation and drug resistance at tufts university comments the exchange of genes is so pervasive that the entire bacterial world can be thought of as one huge multicellular organism in which the cells interchange their genes with ease 26 whether or not that is correct it is certain that hgt has played a major role in the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance around the world since the 1940s antibiotics have forced radical changes in the tempo and direction of bacterial evolution as well as favoring variants that are resistant to the specific antibiotics in use natural selection also favors variants that respond to antibiotic stress by mutating or exchanging genes faster than others and by reproducing more often 27 bacteria have become so efficient in building and sharing resistance that they no longer need months or years to adapt four days after streptomycin therapy begins for a kidney infection for instance streptomycin resistant bacteria outnumber the susceptible bacteria in the patient s urine samples 28 antibiotics are the most powerful evolutionary force that bacteria have ever encountered and bacteria have mounted powerful defenses producing the kinds of unexpected effects that engels described antibiotic pressure on natural selection has shifted the composition of bacterial populations killing off or marginalizing susceptible strains and enabling resistant strains to outnumber them levy who has spent most of his career studying the subject says that antibiotic resistance exemplifies par excellence darwinism in his view the mounting increase in the use of antibiotics not only in people but also in animals and in agriculture has delivered a selection unprecedented in the history of evolution 29 as a result every new antibiotic has been and will be countered by the evolution of resistance noted biochemist gerard wright is blunt resistance proof antibiotics are a fiction 30 antibiotics are either products of living organisms or creations of humans in the lab regardless of their origins they are all subject to natural selection bacteria have acquired the ability to respond to toxins such as antibiotics over millions to billions of years the impact on our use of these compounds to improve health is therefore hardly surprising 31 given the ability of bacteria to replicate quickly the ease of horizontal gene transfer the selective pressure from antibiotic use and the fact that antibiotics predate the dinosaurs and even the cambrian explosion the inevitability of resistance becomes obvious 32 pills promotion and profits antimicrobials are unique among medicines in that the more widely they are used the less effective they become prudent use of antibiotics could have limited the activation and spread of resistance genes but exactly the opposite occurred if pharmaceutical companies had deliberately set out to encourage antibiotic resistance they would have made every effort to ensure that the drugs were disseminated as fast and irrationally as possible which is exactly what happened fleming did not patent penicillin he honorably rejected the very idea of claiming ownership of a natural substance so after the war when material shortages ended and the manufacturing processes were widely known new companies jumped into the penicillin business driving prices down a single dose cost the u s military twenty dollars in 1943 by 1951 the cost was twenty five cents and two years later it was less than one cent 33 the president of pfizer told new york stock market analysts if you want to lose your shirt in a hurry start making penicillin and streptomycin 34 the major drug companies adopted a multipronged response to falling prices and commodification for unpatented drugs they sought high volume sales promoting penicillin for every conceivable use and for some uses that seem inconceivable the marketers went wild particularly in the united states where prescriptions were not required until 1951 penicillin was not only dispensed to patients in hospitals manufacturers tossed it into ointments throat lozenges gum toothpaste inhalable powders even lipstick 35 at the same time corporate researchers searched the world for new natural bacteria killers lederle laboratories a subsidiary of chemical giant american cyanamid had the first success introducing aureomycin in 1948 that was quickly followed by terramycin from pfizer in 1949 and over one hundred more from various companies in the next decade most were first found in tiny amounts in soil home to the highest concentrations of bacteria the goal of these research and development efforts was not better drugs but different drugs that could be patented and sold at higher prices than generic penicillin new antibiotics were launched with minimal testing whether or not there was a medical need for them in 1957 an article in the journal of the american medical association complained of dozens of unimportant modifications designed to compete with drugs that are already available 36 sales and prices were also boosted by creating patentable combinations of existing drugs as of november 1956 there were on the market twenty nine preparations containing two antibiotics twenty containing three eight containing four and four preparations that contained five antibiotics apiece there is no good reason for the use of any of these sixty one mixtures 37 several companies offered supposed cold remedies that combined antibiotics with antihistamines and decongestants colds are caused by viruses not bacteria so antibiotics are powerless against them but by the early 1960s u s doctors were writing four million prescriptions a year for such combinations one of these an antibiotic and antihistamine concoction offered by lederle laboratories under the name achrocidin was said to account for 5 percent of all antibiotic sales in the united states 38 the antibiotics in such products were not just medically worthless but they also promoted the evolution of resistant bacteria in the bodies of consumers increasing the danger posed by future infections another push for high volume sales was a process lederle branded as acronizing reducing meat spoilage by soaking it in an antibiotic bath before shipping sales were over twenty million dollars in 1956 and by 1958 half of the slaughterhouses in the united states had licensed it lederle claimed that cooking would destroy the drugs but apparently did no research on how handling raw meat drenched in aureomycin might affect slaughterhouse workers or homemakers let alone on how such uses accelerated the evolution of resistance 39 but the biggest innovation was marketing and advertising on an unprecedented scale the drug industry discovered that the techniques that had been used so successfully in the advertising of soaps and tooth pastes and of cigarettes automobiles and whiskey could be used as successfully to advertise drugs to doctors 40 lederle led the way shipping ten railcars of aureomycin samples to physicians followed by a direct mail campaign that delivered over a hundred promotional letters to every doctor in the united states in total it spent some two million dollars to convince prescribers that its product was the most versatile antibiotic yet discovered with a wider range of activity than any other known remedy 41 pfizer quickly joined in and took the lead after spending four million dollars to develop terramycin it spent twice that amount the equivalent of eighty million dollars today on a two year blitz campaign targeting doctors competitors followed suit spending millions on sales visits mailings and advertising in journals deluging doctors with promotional materials samples gifts and barely concealed bribes such as free trips to so called seminars in vacation resorts in 1960 henry welch director of the u s federal drug administration s antibiotics division and an outspoken supporter of the industry was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had received over 260 thousand dollars in payments from the companies he was supposed to regulate truth in advertising was not a concern one pfizer advertisement for example displayed the business cards of doctors with different specialties implying that they agreed with the headlined claim that more and more physicians find sigmamycin the antibiotic therapy of choice as saturday review s science editor reported in a widely cited exposé the cards were fake none of the doctors existed 42 but many real doctors did accept the drug companies miracle drug narrative and began prescribing antibiotics even when there was no evidence that they could help a practice that continues today a 2016 study found that despite educational campaigns urging prudent use 30 percent of antibiotic prescriptions in the united states are inappropriate most of these are for viral infections such as colds which do not respond to antibiotics 43 in addition to pushing doctors to overprescribe antibiotics pharmaceutical companies produced a steady stream of propaganda designed to create consumer demand in addition to advertisements subsidized or ghost written articles hailing the benefits of antibiotics appeared frequently in mass circulation magazines soon writes historian elizabeth watkins americans had been conditioned to expect good things from science and they also came to expect pills from their physicians 44 the marketing campaigns worked beyond the dreams of avarice u s antibiotic production rose from 240 thousand pounds in 1948 to over 3 million pounds in 1956 45 pfizer alone increased its annual sales from 39 million dollars to 254 million between 1947 and 1959 46 most importantly for investors those sales were immensely profitable by the mid 1950s pharmaceutical companies were the most profitable corporations in the united states and superprofits continue to this day as michael friedman reports the pharmaceutical sector is the world s most profitable alongside banking the ten largest pharmaceutical corporations made a combined profit of 90 billion in 2013 for a net profit of 19 percent in 2009 global antibiotic sales were worth 42 billion equivalent to 5 percent of the pharmaceutical market this figure rose to 43 55 billion in 2012 and is expected to grow to 45 09 billion by 2019 47 the pharmaceutical giants maintain these figures by spending up to twice as much on sales and marketing as on research and development 48 drug hucksters go south despite pious declarations that it puts people first big pharma is as a former editor of the new england journal of medicine writes primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit 49 its ethical standards are low even by normal corporate standards a report by the ngo public citizen shows that from 1991 through 2015 u s pharmaceutical companies paid 35 7 billion dollars to settle 373 federal and state charges mainly related to drug pricing fraud and unlawful promotion of drugs many including giants pfizer merck glaxosmithkline novartis and bristol myers squibb paid large fines for multiple offenses public citizen concludes that the companies view such payments as a cost of doing business these illegal but profitable activities will continue to be part of companies business model 50 if drug companies are so willing to break u s laws it should not be surprising that they and their affiliates have long taken maximum advantage of weak or nonexistent regulation in the global south as a result long standing health problems caused by poverty have been exacerbated by the massive overuse and misuse of antibiotics that has been actively promoted by the pharmaceutical industry at every level in books and papers published between 1973 and 1992 milton silverman mia lydecker and philip r lee of the university of california san francisco systematically documented abuses of medical and business ethics by drug companies in search of third world sales they showed for example that supposedly educational materials produced by drug companies differed substantially from north to south and between countries in the south in contrast to the promotional material provided to physicians in the united states and great britain material presented to physicians in third world countries was found to be marked by gross exaggeration of product effectiveness and minimized or completely omitted potential hazards the identical products marketed by the same company may be promoted in some countries only for the control of typhoid fever and other serious diseases while in other countries they are recommended for the treatment of such scarcely life threatening conditions as tonsillitis laryngitis bronchitis and bacterial skin infections a common practice is handing out samples that doctors can resell the physician not only prescribes the drug for a fee but also sells the drug for a profit to the patient under such conditions overprescribing is almost inevitable 51 in 1992 silverman lydecker and lee showed that the practices that originated with multinationals high pressure sales to doctors by direct sales agents misrepresentation about products bribery and so on had been widely adopted by domestic manufacturers in the south in 2018 researchers in bangladesh found such practices were still common overstatement and misinformation about antibiotics are very common in bangladesh which significantly influences doctors prescribing behaviors currently pharmaceutical companies are the only organizations in bangladesh providing medicine information to health professionals and in some cases the information provided is not consistent with recommendations from public health bodies a large number of physicians are reported to accept economic incentives from the pharmaceutical companies as a result the physicians receiving economic incentives feel obliged to prescribe company s branded medicines including antimicrobials irrespective of quality consideration 52 as who says promotional activities of the drug manufacturers have created a demand greater than the actual needs 53 an oxfam study found that as a direct result of intensive promotion by both multinationals and local manufacturers overprescribing and misuse of antibiotics is rife throughout the global south all the key first line antibiotics are used irrationally throughout the third world the pattern seems to be when in doubt prescribe an antibiotic a pharmacist in bangladesh will recommend a penicillin injection for a baby with nappy rash hospital doctors in north yemen will give penicillin injections to a breast feeding mother with sore nipples in bangladesh a young boy knocked down by a motorised rickshaw is prescribed tetracycline and half a dozen other drugs for a mild concussion even in remote areas of the amazon poorly trained health workers have been distributing tetracycline capsules with apparent total disregard for the problems of drug resistance 54 a recent cnn report on antibiotic resistance in afghanistan found both inappropriate prescribing by doctors and widespread use of antibiotics without medical advice fueling the superbug problem in afghanistan is the unregulated sale of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture drugs are advertised on television and available to buy over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription or diagnosis from a doctor they give them out like sweets said dr doris burtscher a medical anthropologist at médecins sans frontières burtscher compiled a report in 2015 about attitudes to antibiotics at a public hospital in kabul and found that the drugs were taken for such issues as bruised knees nosebleeds and body pain as well as by women after menstruating 55 in most of the global south even in countries where prescriptions are supposedly required street vendors and pharmacies with untrained staff are a primary source of medicine drugs especially antibiotics are sold routinely for every ailment as infectious diseases advisor rupa kanapathipillai of médecins sans frontières msf doctors without borders says this can have deadly results particularly in a lot of the countries where msf works patients can purchase broad spectrum antibiotics in markets and pharmacies without prescriptions they then become unnecessarily exposed to different types of antibacterial agents so to different types of antibiotics bacteria become exposed to these types of antibiotics and are more likely to develop resistance to them 56 burtscher told cnn that overuse in afghanistan reflects a strong cultural trend toward taking antibiotics if so the cultural trend was created and reinforced by an industry that has deliberately promoted miracle drugs as the solution to all health problems as silverman lydecker and lee write heavy promotion by manufacturers and doctors has ensured that much of the public has become convinced that there must be a pill for every ill 57 oxfam s dianna melrose agrees since both manufacturers and prescribers give too much encouragement to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics it is hardly surprising that ordinary people have come to see antibiotics as panaceas 58 per capita consumption of antibiotics is still highest in the united states but southern countries are gaining fast between 2000 and 2015 antibiotic consumption rose 103 percent in india 79 percent in china and 65 percent in pakistan if current trends continue global consumption will increase 200 percent by 2030 and most of that growth will be in the south 59 since up to 80 percent of every antibiotic dose is excreted unchanged most antibiotics enter the environment if appropriate sewage treatment is available some antibiotics may be eliminated but even advanced treatment systems do not remove resistant bacteria where sewage treatment is inadequate or as in most of the global south where there is no sewage treatment at all the antibiotics and resistant germs that humans excrete end up in rivers lakes oceans and groundwater this is a particularly critical issue with effluent from hospitals which typically contains high concentrations of antibiotics and bacteria for example a study of wastewater treatment in hospitals in vietnam found that even after treatment significant concentrations of antibiotics were still present in the hospital effluents which when released to the environment could promote the selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria 60 big pharma and big farms antibiotic waste from human use is a serious environmental problem but it pales beside the impact of feeding antibiotics to animals who consume and excrete far more than humans globally the great majority of all antibiotic production is fed to livestock and since even the world s most advanced hospitals produce resistant bacteria no one should be surprised that barns crammed with animals are producing far more without antibiotics what tony weis calls the meatfication of the western diet a quadrupling of world meat production in a mere half century would not have been possible 61 when large numbers of genetically similar animals are confined in the close unhygienic conditions that have characterized industrial livestock production rapid spread of disease is all but inevitable so when confined animal feeding operations cafos became widespread in the united states after the second world war pharmaceutical marketers saw a golden opportunity they began selling antibiotics in bulk to the then new factory farms claiming that low doses in feed would prevent disease and somehow cause animals to grow bigger and faster despite the absence of scientific evidence that so called growth promotion additives gpas actually promoted growth countries that have banned the use of antibiotics for growth promotion have seen no significant decline in production lending credence to the view held by some that gpas were no more than a brilliant means for drug companies to sell otherwise worthless leftover mash a huge exercise in american hucksterism an epidemiologist with the centers for disease control comments if there was evidence they worked the pharmaceutical industry would have provided that they would have been falling all over themselves to show the evidence it worked 62 the authors of a uk government report on amr suggest in fact that antibiotics are more effective growth promoters when used for animals kept in cramped dirty unregulated conditions than for animals living in cleaner more open more controlled environments under suboptimal conditions the growth promoters are for all practical purposes a substitute for good infection prevention and control 63 in short as ellen silbergeld of the john hopkins school of public health says antibiotics are used to compensate for what is accepted practice in poultry and swine houses which i prefer to analogize to badly run and overcrowded hospitals 64 unfortunately and inevitably the antibiotics used in agriculture and the resistant bacteria they produce do not only affect the animals in 1976 levy demonstrated the problem on a small scale by dividing three hundred three month old chicks into two groups half received tetracycline in their feed half did not the control group did not change but tetracycline resistant bacteria appeared almost immediately in the feces of the others after twelve weeks those chicks were also excreting bacteria that were resistant to streptomycin sulfonamides ampicillin and carbenicillin none of which they had been exposed to five months after tetracycline was first used on the farm family members living about 500 feet from the chicken barn were also found to harbor high numbers of resistant fecal bacteria including multiply resistant bacteria none of these individuals was taking an antibiotic 65 if a few chicks could develop and spread resistant genes that quickly how much worse is the situation in and around industrial farms that raise tens of thousands of animals science journalist maryn mckenna tells us researchers have found resistant bacteria in the soil around chicken farms in groundwater under hog farms and in dust borne away from an intensive farm by the wind the trucks that bear chickens from farm to slaughter stacked up in towers of wire cages stream a plume of resistant bacteria behind them that can contaminate cars on the same road scientists have found resistant bacteria being carried away by flies from chicken farms in delaware and maryland and hog farms in kansas and north carolina all of those accidental exportations cause the environment outside farms to be loaded not just with resistant bacteria but with genes that confer resistance 66 workers on factory farms and in slaughterhouses become unwitting carriers spreading resistant bacteria and genes into the community a 2018 report on the pork industry published by the natural resources defense council summarizes some recent studies a study of more than 1 300 iowans determined that people working on pig farms were six times more likely to be carriers of multidrug resistant s aureus than were iowans not exposed to pigs in particular pig workers and their children are more highly colonized with methicillin resistant s aureus than the general public a separate study examined workers from 22 industrialized pig operations and found that 45 5 percent were carriers of mrsa of all the staphylococcus bacteria carried by these workers 82 percent were found to be resistant to tetracycline the antibiotic most widely used in pig production a third study somewhat earlier and more limited looked at 20 workers from two pig operations in iowa and illinois and found 45 percent of them were colonized with mrsa bacteria slaughterhouse workers face elevated risks as well one recent study found 21 6 percent of them were carrying s aureus bacteria the s aureus isolated were resistant to more than 2 5 times the number of antibiotic classes than were s aureus from the slaughterhouse workers neighbors nearly 22 percent of these workers specifically carried mrsa 67 cafos in the united states produce over forty times more solid waste mostly feces than all publicly owned wastewater treatment plants combined almost all of it enters the environment without treatment 68 the manure produced by industrial hog operations ihos accumulates in immense cesspools euphemistically called lagoons before being sprayed or spread on the land contaminating soil sediment and groundwater in north carolina a state that has more than two thousand giant hog farms and four thousand pig shit lagoons researchers found that people living near iho liquid waste application sites have elevated rates of infection with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and that african americans latinos and indigenous people are disproportionately affected 69 silbergeld and her colleagues call factory farms agricultural incubators for resistant bacteria the use of antimicrobials as feed additives results in uncontrolled and subtherapeutic doses over the lifetime of animals raised in grossly unhygienic surroundings this presents the worst possible scenario for resistance selection and infection control coupled with incomplete biosecurity and biocontainment and mostly nonexistent waste treatment these conditions lead to dissemination into human hosts and the environment with amplification of reservoirs of resistance 70 large volumes of antibiotics are also used to prevent infections in fish farms orchards and beehives and possibly the most outrageous use of all some golf courses even spray oxytetracycline to kill bacteria that cause turfgrass to wilt until recently in the united states anyone could walk into a feed store and buy tons of antibiotic dosed grain or barrels of straight drugs if they preferred to mix their own no prescription required no questions asked as much as 80 percent of annual u s production was given to chickens pigs cattle and other livestock in 2017 after the food and drug administration banned the use of antibiotics for growth promotion antibiotics for animals still constituted 64 percent of u s sales by weight over 90 percent of that was delivered in healthy animals food and water for so called disease prevention the requirement of a veterinarian s prescription does not appear to be a major obstacle to antibiotic use the fact that many physicians routinely overprescribe antibiotics for people suggests that agribusiness giants will not have any difficulty finding veterinarians who are willing to do the same for livestock especially in states that allow animal doctors to prescribe and sell medicines this combined with the general reduction of environmental protections in the trump era means that animal antibiotic use in the united states may soon return to former levels deliberate ignorance scientists have learned an enormous amount about bacteria in the decades since antibiotics were introduced so it might be argued that the overpromotion and overuse of antibiotics after the second world war resulted from lack of knowledge of the dangers as the prophet isaiah said the combination of greed and ignorance is particularly dangerous i perhaps ignorance played a role but if so it was deliberate ignorance like the so called climate science skepticism so conveniently adopted by the executives of fossil fuel companies the precise mechanisms may not have been discovered but the resistance problem was well known before the drug companies became big time antibiotic pushers sulfa drugs anti infective chemicals that were developed in germany in the 1930s had lost effectiveness against many bacteria by the beginning of the war howard florey and ernst chain observed some resistance to penicillin in laboratory tests as early as 1940 in his 1945 nobel prize speech alexander fleming warned that antibiotic use should be carefully managed because it is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin ii in 1948 mary barber discoverer of the first resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus warned that the present widespread and often indiscriminate use of penicillin particularly as a preventive measure is seriously menacing its future reputation iii in 1955 a partial literature survey identified 564 published scientific papers on antibiotic resistance iv in the same year in the proceedings of the royal society of medicine prominent british surgeon lindsay batten cautioned that we may come to the end of antibiotics we may run clean out of effective ammunition and then how the bacteria and moulds will lord it vshortly after horizontal gene transfer was discovered the new england journal of medicine warned unless drastic measures are taken very soon physicians may find themselves back in the preantibiotic middle ages in the treatment of infectious diseases vi the role of factory farming in spreading resistance was also known long ago as early as 1953 physician barnett stross speaking in the british house of commons argued that if pigs are fed in this way new types of bacteria may evolve and thrive which are resistant to the penicillin if there be migration of the bacteria to humans we may find ourselves in trouble vii and shortly before her death in 1964 rachel carson author of the environmental classic silent spring wrote that diseases sweep through these establishments which indeed are kept going only by the continuous administration of antibiotics disease organisms then become resistant to the antibiotics viii those warnings and many others were ignored if human health had been big pharma s main concern it would have changed course long ago a rational approach would have been to avoid all unnecessary use of antibiotics monitor essential uses carefully and study how to minimize bacterial evolution but human health has never been a priority for the pharmaceutical industry drugs are a way to accumulate capital and human health is at best a side effect notes i

cabi 2013 32 industrial pollution if you are prescribed an antibiotic in europe or north america it is almost certain that the active pharmaceutical ingredients apis were manufactured in china then made into pills or capsules and packaged in india in the past three decades most drug manufacturing operations in the north have been shut down and big pharma has outsourced production to the global south where wages are low and regulation is weak china now makes 80 to 90 percent of apis and india is the largest producer of finished medicines particularly private label generics some manufacturing has also moved to pakistan bangladesh and southeast asia while some southern operations are subsidiaries of northern drug companies or joint ventures most production is done by locally owned companies that compete to produce drugs for multinationals there are about five thousand pharmaceutical factories in china and over eight thousand in india but most antibiotic production takes place in about two hundred facilities owned by a handful of large companies india s sun pharma for example has over thirty thousand employees and forty factories 71 the supply chains are complex and virtually impossible to trace the northern companies whose names go on the box or bottle and the southern manufacturers who make the contents all treat their arrangements as trade secrets and publish as little information as possible in any industry corporations whose business strategy is to be the lowest cost provider of commodity products must do everything possible to cut costs in pharmaceuticals that includes offloading the cost of waste disposal onto the environment local regulators and inspectors look the other way either because they are political appointees who do not want to challenge local businesses or because they are corrupt or often both trade secrecy and political protection of polluters means that no comprehensive picture exists of pharmaceutical industry pollution in the south but a growing number of studies indicate that release of antibiotics and resistant bacteria into land and water is a major problem perhaps the most disturbing example is in the city of hyderabad in southeastern india one of the largest centers of bulk drug production in the world in 2007 researchers examined effluent from the wastewater treatment plant that receives and processes waste from some ninety drug manufacturers in patancheru an industrial suburb samples of effluent from the plant treated liquid that flows into a stream and then into several rivers contained the highest levels of drugs any study had found in effluent anywhere notably the antibiotic ciprofloxacin was found in concentrations one thousand times higher than the dosage recommended for patients with serious bacterial infections the scientists calculated that manufacturers in the area must be discarding forty five kilograms of ciprofloxacin a day enough to treat forty four thousand people 72 a follow up study in 2009 found unprecedented drug contamination of surface ground and drinking water around hyderabad and very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics in two nearby lakes in one of the lakes the concentration of antibiotics was higher than is normally found in the blood of patients under treatment 73 a lake that was once popular for swimming and fishing has been described as a giant petri dish for anti microbial resistance 74 these studies were headed by joakim larsson of sweden s gothenburg university as he writes the antibiotic pollution in hyderabad is not unique similar concentrations of oxytetracycline and penicillin have been found in treated effluent from chinese factories and high concentrations of apis have been found in waste discharged from drug factories in south korea taiwan and pakistan 75 a report published in 2016 by the liberal watchdog group sumofus remarked that lax regulatory enforcement corruption and corporate negligence have enabled china s antibiotics manufacturers to pollute in impunity for decades the unmonitored dumping of pharmaceutical effluent has contaminated land and waterways surrounding the factories with toxic chemicals and active antibiotic substances making local communities lives a misery and fuelling the global amr crisis the problem is not restricted to the plants immediate environment recent studies and investigations have found antibiotics in almost all of china s major rivers 76 as the european public health alliance argues antimicrobial resistance amr and pharmaceutical pollution in the environment pie are twin problems that are closely connected weak domestic regulations insufficient inspection capacities and lax procurement rules allow multinational companies to bypass international standards and pollute unchecked antibiotic residues pose a growing problem not only do they contaminate surface and ground waters soil and sediment with consequences for aquatic life crops and plants and quality of drinking water they also contribute to the proliferation of resistant bacteria which are passed on to local people and animals via polluted water international travel and trade carry resistant bacteria around the globe 77 a perfect storm in the resistome the major problem with antibiotic overuse and pollution is not immediate transmission of disease although that is a concern but the increasing volume of resistant genes and harmful bacteria in the environment resistance as such is only detected when someone is infected and antibiotic treatment fails possibly far from where the bacteria first appeared if you carry bacteria with resistant genes you are not only in greater danger of contracting untreatable infections in the future but you will also almost certainly pass resistant bacteria onto other people since every time you breathe or touch anything you leave some of your trillions of bacteria behind and pick up bacteria left by others as more resistant bacteria enter the environment there are evermore opportunities for their genes to spread the worldwide pool of resistance genes that bacteria may acquire is called the antibiotic resistome resistance originally evolved to deal with the small concentrations of toxins found in nature so for most of history the resistome was limited in size and scope and many of the genes were inactive most of the time a team headed by william gaze of the european centre for environment and human health explains how mass use of antibiotics has changed that humans have created environments with unprecedented mixing opportunities between environmental bacteria and human pathogens in the presence of such selective agents through for example sewage and waste water treatment plants chemical production factories and the practice of spreading manure on farmland these opportunities provide conditions that greatly facilitate gene mobilization the result is a perfect storm of opportunity for bacterial human pathogens that exploits millions of years of evolution uncounted microbial generations and modern human activity hgt hot spots areas with high concentrations of bacteria where gene transfer can easily occur have probably existed since shortly after the first bacteria appeared in the past eight decades misuse and overuse of antibiotics has concentrated resistance genes in those hot spots creating a cocktail with high numbers of bacteria of human and animal origin that offer an unprecedented opportunity for genetic exchange between environmental bacteria and pathogens 78 hot spots in soil and water as well as in hospitals factories sewage treatment plants and factory farms provide excellent conditions for the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria in local ecosystems and around the world the net result is an exploded mobile metagenome of shared genetic traits that is fluid and readily promulgated through microbial populations the rapid movement of water plants animals soil and humans across the planet virtually ensures that such traits and associated organisms once easily ecologically segregated can move seamlessly through habitats across the globe the result is that no regions are safe or can escape the introduction and movement of antimicrobial drug resistant organisms and their genes 79 there are no national borders in the resistome no barriers that prevent or even slow the global spread of resistance genes consider carpabenam and colistin last resort antibiotics that no bacteria could resist bacteria with a gene that provides resistance to carpabenam were first seen in india in 2008 by 2012 the gene was found over one thousand times in fifty five countries bacteria with a gene that resists colistin appeared in china in 2015 and it spread to bacteria in more than thirty countries in less than a year as microbiologist thomas o brien says use of an antimicrobial anywhere can increase resistance to any antimicrobial anywhere else 80 not just pathogens most research and policy discussion on antibiotic resistance has focused on its direct effects on human health and health care that is not surprising since untreatable infections are already a global medical problem that is likely to get much worse nevertheless it is important to recognize that the millions of metric tons of antibiotics that have been added to the environment are not simply affecting the few types of bacteria that cause diseases in humans and other animals microbes that provide essential life support services also have to cope with unprecedented amounts of toxins for example the global carbon and nitrogen cycles are fundamental to the functioning of the biosphere and the maintenance of life of all kinds and neither would be possible without the metabolic operations of specific types of bacteria those biogeochemical cycles evolved on earth when antibiotics only existed in tiny amounts and we have no idea what the long term effects of high environmental concentrations might be as biologist michael gillings writes the antibiotic revolution may be having effects across the entire microbial biosphere we need to address the antibiotic resistance problem from a broader evolutionary and ecological perspective the ability of natural selection to shape species and communities is the same for microorganisms as it is for larger species and the ecological theory of community assembly developed for multicellular organisms can be applied to the microbiome the risk associated with the environmental spread of resistance genes with known adverse consequences for human welfare has had little attention nor has the potential for pollution with antibiotics to widely affect the global microbiome 81 planetary boundaries when earth system scientists first concluded that a new epoch in planetary history had begun they illustrated their findings with twenty four graphs showing global scale environmental changes since the industrial revolution every one of the graphs water use atmospheric carbon dioxide biodiversity decline great floods and more rose very slowly or not at all until about 1950 and then turned sharply upward those hockey stick curves illustrate what is now called the great acceleration the most rapid transformation of the human relationship with the natural world in the history of humankind 82 earth system scientists now view the great acceleration as a decisive turning point a time of transition between the eleven thousand year old holocene epoch and the anthropocene there is a continuing discussion about whether and how to amend the formal geological time scale but there is no question that qualitative changes to the earth system began in the mid twentieth century and have accelerated since a graph of antibiotic production would closely resemble the great acceleration graphs nonexistent before 1942 followed by a rapid and exponential rise from mid century on the similarity is no coincidence the introduction of mass produced drugs is part of the third technological revolution described by ernest mandel as an epoch of unprecedented fusion of science technology and production that has transformed agriculture manufacturing transportation telecommunications materials chemicals and of course greenhouse gases 83 the rise of antibiotic production and use is part of this revolution and the great acceleration some scientists now argue that antibiotics should be viewed as nonrenewable resources and antimicrobial resistance as a global environmental crisis as a team headed by peter søgaard jørgensen of the royal swedish academy of sciences recently wrote there are strong parallels between how the burning of fossil fuels has altered our climate and how pollution with antibiotics has depleted the abundance of easily treatable microorganisms and diminished the many benefits human receive from microorganisms antibiotics resemble fossil fuels in their foundational role in industrial societies and the consequent need for concerted collective action 84 jørgensen is a principal investigator in the living with resistance project an international multidisciplinary effort to address the socio ecological dilemmas that constrain society s response to resistance evolution 85 in a review article published recently in nature sustainability they propose that antibiotic resistance be added to the planetary boundaries defining a safe operating space for humanity that were identified by the stockholm resilience centre in 2009 and updated in 2015 86 the question jørgensen and colleagues maintain is whether we have already crossed the safe zones of the anthropocene operating space for biocide susceptibility they propose three zones of increasing risk for pathogens safe uncertain and surpassed based on how many antibiotics are no longer effective against them zero to all and the availability of alternatives many to none the result of this sorting is not heartening the anthropocene operating space for antibiotic susceptibility globally surpassed for gram negative bacteria and in the uncertain zone for gram positive bacteria this does not mean that every infection caused by gram negative pathogen is incurable but that current methods of treating such infections frequently fail overall we are entering a new phase in which levels of multiple resistance and pan resistance put the sustainability of current practices at increasing risk 87 this initial approach to antibacterial planetary boundaries will undoubtedly be reviewed and modified over time but it is an important step toward integrating microbiology into our understanding of the anthropocene the gunfighter illusion in 1959 when the biochemical arms race between antibiotics and bacteria was heating up the noted microbiologist and environmentalist rené dubos warned against a strategy that was entirely dependent on magic bullets the belief that disease can be conquered through the use of drugs fails to take into account the difficulties arising from the ecological complexity of human problems it is an attitude comparable to the naïve cowboy philosophy that permeates the wild west thriller in the crime ridden frontier town the hero singlehanded blasts out the desperadoes who were running rampant through the settlement the story ends on a happy note because it appears that peace has been restored but in reality the death of the villains does not solve the fundamental problem for the rotten social conditions which had opened the town to the desperadoes will soon allow others to come in unless something is done to correct the primary source of trouble 88 sixty years later dubos s warning seems remarkably prescient the cowboy hero is mortally wounded the desperadoes are stronger than ever and the rotten social conditions remain those who hailed the first antibiotics as miracle drugs were not wrong what those chemicals could have been was a way to work with nature to use natural processes to overcome diseases that had plagued us for thousands of years used with appropriate humility and careful stewardship in conjunction with a global drive to eradicate the conditions that cause infectious diseases penicillin and its successors could have been boons to humanity for centuries but that would have required a radically different economy and society instead the new drugs were promoted and sold as high volume commodities whose primary function was to generate fast profits pharmaceutical giants and manufacturers doctors and private hospitals pharmacies and more at every stage the profit economy has pushed antibiotics for short term gain without regard for long term effects the expression to kill the goose that lays the golden egg has rarely been more appropriate capitalism always operates in the short term and its defenders always insist that new technology will solve any problems that might arise for several decades antibiotics seemed to confirm that superstition for every drug that stopped working new ones were discovered but that did not last the early discoveries were low hanging fruit and searching the higher branches has been hard and largely unsuccessful mainstream economists like to claim that the market solves all if there is a need customer demand will produce solutions but today when bacteria have found ways to resist every available antibiotic most pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for others not because new antibiotics would not be profitable but because they would not be profitable enough big pharma makes double digit profits from drugs it sells for thousands of dollars a dose to patients who must take them frequently for many years antibiotics just do not fit that business model and yet despite big pharma s responsibility for creating the crisis many mainstream proposals for addressing the amr crisis involve bribing pharmaceutical makers to get back into the business with the excuse of correcting a market failure supposed experts urge governments to guarantee still more profits for the companies that have already made billions by hustling antibiotics into oblivion as amábile cuevas argues such plans only illustrate the pervasive and destructive impact of free market theology from the clinical side free market notions have only allowed antibiotic abuse especially of broad spectrum antibiotics that are good for business as they can be used against many diseases the abandonment of antibiotic r d as there are other more profitable avenues for pharmaceutical research and the immoral notion of the need for incentives including higher prices to big pharma back to the antibiotic business from the agricultural arena which is the main antibiotic abuser the only reasons for antibiotic usage are of financial nature most particularly the massive use of antibiotics for growth promotion agricultural use of antibiotics of all antibiotics not only those without direct clinical use must cease immediately worldwide this would prevent the further selection of resistant organisms within food animals which in turn get into our foodstuff and the release of antibiotics and resistant organisms in the many forms of waste these activities generate that end up one way or another in the environment antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in the environment mark one of the many convergences of public health and ecology in the end both deal with the wellbeing of living organisms free market theologies have their focus and faith at precisely the other end of the scale while it may be permissible for free market to decide whether a brand of cell phones or cosmetics prevail or not environmental and health regulations must be completely detached from it this may sound unrealistic but our very lives depend on understanding it and acting accordingly 89 to tackle antimicrobial resistance we must rescue public health from profit making corporations but getting the profiteers out of medicine is only part of the solution massive damage has already been done by pharmaceutical pollution and it cannot be easily reversed natural selection has spread antibiotic resistance worldwide but so far as we know there are no counter selection mechanisms that would remove resistance genes if antibiotic pollution stopped even if such a countervailing force does exist it will not eliminate amr quickly this means that the use of antibiotics including any new ones that may be discovered must be stringently limited to essential cases and all waste must be contained and destroyed agricultural use of antibiotics except to treat specific diseases in individual animals must be stopped period expropriating big pharma must be accompanied by a global campaign to eliminate the rotten social conditions that lie behind antibiotic overuse and misuse for example diarrhea is a major killer in the global south claiming 1 1 million lives a year the uk review on antimicrobial resistance found that in just four countries india indonesia nigeria and brazil close to 500 million courses of antibiotics a year are each year used to treat diarrhoea the commissioners concluded that with universal access to improved water and sanitation this would be reduced by some 60 percent 90 as this example shows antibiotic resistance is not simply a medical or biological problem it is a social and economic crisis while we can and should fight for clean water sanitation and primary health care as basic human rights experience shows that such changes will be resisted by a system that measures the value of human lives in dollars and judges every reform by its effect on corporate profit addressing amr effectively will require a level of global effort and redirection of resources comparable to the fight against climate change biodiversity loss and other ecological crises that define the anthropocene if pharmaceutical business as usual prevails the new epoch will be a time when few if any antibiotics work and bacterial evolution will remake earth s life support systems in ways we cannot predict postscript while this article was in production the u s environmental protection agency proposed to allow growers to spray as much as 650 thousand pounds of streptomycin a year on citrus trees in florida to combat citrus greening disease that is nearly fifty times as much as the antibiotics humans use each year but the environmental protection agency has not studied how the spraying will affect antibiotic resistance and there is no evidence that it would be effective against citrus greening notes

employees work on an aluminum equipment assembly line in qinhuangdao hebei province strong domestic demand to sustain momentum says multilateral lender china s economy is expected to grow by 6 2 percent this year and by 6 1 percent next year despite rising global uncertainties the world bank said on friday the world s second largest economy has remained resilient although new trade tariffs have taken effect and global growth slowed the multilateral lending organization said china s economy will need to rely increasingly on domestic demand to sustain rapid growth it said in the may edition of the china economic update china s growth in the first quarter was stronger than expected and the growth momentum increased in march another positive factor to support the projection at 6 2 percent for this year is the government s strong fiscal stimulus package according to john litwack the world bank s lead economist for china next year the escalation of trade tensions would not only affect china but also the rest of the world partly because the prospects for world economic growth look lower than before litwack said in an interview with china daily although the direct impact on trade will be measurable and manageable the impact on investor sentiment is difficult to gauge and will depend on the degree to which the trade tensions are expected to be temporary as opposed to a longer duration the economist said the renewed trade tensions have increased fluctuations in the foreign exchange market some investors speculated that the chinese currency is under pressure and the yuan s exchange rate against the us dollar may slip to around 7 an important psychological threshold for stabilizing market sentiment the exchange rate policy in china is more transparent than it used to be said litwack the main trends in the yuan exchange is mainly determined by economic fundamentals but it can also be influenced by short term speculative factors the chinese central bank has done well in smoothing volatility from speculative factors while allowing the market forces to determine the currency value the world s second largest economy recorded a gdp growth rate of 6 4 percent in the first quarter unchanged from the fourth quarter of last year compared with 6 8 percent in the first half of 2018 the escalation in trade tensions between china and the united states however may lead to weaker business confidence and slower global trade growth which is expected to weigh on investment and exports in 2020 said the report the world bank downgraded the projection for china to 6 1 percent in 2020 from 6 2 percent in the previous forecast there is still some room for the central government to expand fiscal policy although some local governments no longer have much space said the world bank economist the people s bank of china has made a good decision to maintain a prudent monetary policy the encouragement for commercial banks to lend more to small and private businesses is also helpful to stabilize growth the national bureau of statistics released china s official manufacturing purchasing managers index on friday the figure declined for the second consecutive month in may and stood at 49 4 compared with 50 1 in april indicating the manufacturing sector s contraction production activities continued to expand in may while demand slackened somewhat said zhao qinghe a senior statistician with the nbs china s nonmanufacturing pmi stayed unchanged from the previous month and stood at 54 3 in may registering the fifth month in a row with a reading of above 54 the manufacturing pmi reading weakened in may as escalated sino us trade tensions have impaired enterprises confidence said liu chunsheng an associate professor with the central university of finance and economics in beijing enterprises adopted a wait and see approach to weather heightened uncertainty dampening the expansion in business activities liu said citing that small businesses scaled down activities the most as they are more flexible in decision making and more vulnerable to negative shocks in the long term china should stick to reform and opening up as well as technological innovation to deal with lingering external uncertainties liu said

cnn the return of tariff man set off another wave of selling on wall street with the dow tumbling below 25 000 to four month lows on friday president donald trump s threat to impose escalating tariffs on mexico one of america s largest and most important trading partners amplified fears about slowing economic growth the dow declined 355 points or 1 4 capping its sixth straight losing week that s the longest slump since june 2011 it s also the first time the dow has closed below 25 000 since late january the s p 500 fell 1 4 and the nasdaq lost 1 5 this is just the latest worry to put on the fire for investors ryan detrick senior market strategist at lpl financial wrote in a note to clients the big question at the end of the day though is can we really fight two trade wars at the same time the dow and s p 500 declined nearly 7 apiece in may their first losing months since december the nasdaq tumbled 8 on the month its worst may since 2010 trump s vow on thursday evening to impose tariffs on mexico one of america s largest trading partners only exacerbate investor worries about how trade tensions will disrupt business and slow global economic growth wall street was already growing concerned about the escalating trade battle with china the united states imported 346 billion of goods from mexico last year including everything from auto parts and avocados to beer and televisions major corporations already found themselves caught in the crosshairs of the outburst of tensions with mexico levi strauss tumbled 7 reflecting concerns about the fact that up to a fifth of

mexico as a vital part of their supply chain fell sharply fiat chrysler lost 6 while general motors declined 4 and ford lost 2 parts suppliers including lear and delphi technologies also stumbled alarming decision trump said the united states will impose a 5 tariff on all mexican imports starting on june 10 as a punishment for illegal immigrants crossing the mexican border into the united states the white house indicated the tariff would increase by increments of 5 percentage points each month until it reaches 25 in october some analysts expressed concern that trump is imposing tariffs in response to immigration problems not economic or trade ones tariffs can be thrown around as an economic bomb for anything now peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group wrote in a note to clients global growth rates will only continue to suffer kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco called it an alarming decision by the us administration to open up a new and unexpected frontier by using tariffs as a weapon beyond just trade policy markets don t like surprises and this is a big surprise hooper wrote in a note worse there were signs that the crackdown on mexico may not be part of a broader economic strategy on behalf of the trump administration in fact robert lighthizer trump s top trade official joined treasury secretary steven mnuchin

wall street is no fan of tariff man the stock market stumbled friday to its first losing month of 2019 in may primarily due to president donald trump s decision to broadly wield his tariff powers first against china over trade and then against mexico over immigration during stocks month long slide investors wrestled with the potential impact that the u s s escalating trade war with china could have on corporate and economic growth friday s losses came after trump announced plans via twitter to impose tariffs on mexico in a bid to compel the nation s third biggest trading partner to crack down on migrants attempting to enter the u s the move shocked investors and spurred a broad sell off that sliced more than 350 points from the dow jones industrial average the selling left the benchmark s p 500 index 6 6 lower for the month and up 9 8 for the year so far clearly the markets were blindsided and completely caught off guard said cliff hodge director of investments for cornerstone wealth it was only a month ago that the s p 500 hit a record high and underlined its claim as the longest bull market for stocks on record at more than a decade long the market had climbed steadily through 2019 amid rising investor confidence that a deal with china was at hand and that the federal reserve would not tip the economy into recession by raising interest rates too aggressively but when the first weekend of may arrived trump s tweet threatening more tariffs on china upended months of calm in the market investors are now preparing for a much longer and messier resolution to the global trade war than they were expecting just a few weeks ago the trade conflicts have also clouded the global economic outlook with many economists now forecasting u s growth to weaken in the coming months that s likely to weigh on corporate profits this year what you had over the last few days really is an increase in global uncertainty and the economic data has been poor and weakening said tom martin senior portfolio manager with globalt investments with rising costs as a result of tariffs and rising uncertainty that s definitely going to have a damper on earnings the s p 500 index fell 36 80 points or 1 3 to 2 752 06 it s the first time the s p 500 has dropped for four straight weeks since autumn 2014 the dow lost 354 84 points or 1 4 to 24 815 04 the nasdaq slid 114 57 points or 1 5 to 7 453 15 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 20 04 points or 1 4 to 1 465 49 major stock indexes in europe also fell you had a market that was feeling as though president trump would want to do a deal so that the economy would not be hurt said martin and now the behavior is indicating that he will use tariffs to accomplish his goals and seems less concerned about the actual economic impact since the end of april investors have sought out safer investments like utilities and bonds technology stocks which led gains all year were among the month s biggest losers the technology heavy nasdaq shed 7 9 while technology companies within the s p 500 lost 8 9 utilities which have lagged the market fell only 1 3 in may making them among the month s best performers meanwhile real estate stocks posted a 0 9 gain the only winners this month the new tariffs on mexican goods shocked investors who were already nervous about a global trade war crimping economic growth the new front in the trade war hit automakers particularly hard many of them import vehicles from mexico general motors slid 4 3 friday while fiat chrysler dropped 4 8 ford motor lost 2 3 banks also declined as higher bond prices pushed yields lower the yield on the 10 year treasury note slid to 2 13 from 2 22 late thursday investors have been shifting money into bonds over concerns that economic growth will be crimped by the ongoing trade war lower bond yields drag down interest rates making lending less profitable for banks citigroup fell 2 3 and bank of america lost 2 1 energy companies sank following another broad slide in oil prices occidental petroleum fell 4 1 and valero energy dropped 3 4 investors have been fleeing to safer holdings all month the shift to utilities and bonds quickened earlier in may after the u s and china broke off negotiations the u s then pushed more tariffs on chinese goods along with a ban on technology sales that prompted retaliatory tariffs from china and threats over other key resources while the u s economy grew at a solid 3 1 annual rate in the january march quarter many economists now think growth is likely to weaken in coming months they cite a range of threats facing the u s economy including escalating trade conflicts more cautious spending by consumers and businesses and a global economic slowdown on friday a report showed china s factory activity slowed in may as the trade war between washington and beijing escalated economists say china may be drawing up its own list of retaliatory targets among u s companies the worry is that a trade war fought on multiple fronts around the world will be a drag on corporate profits and on a u s economy that s been supported by a solid job market that worry pulled the yield on the 10 year treasury note to its lowest level since the summer of 2017 that s left long term treasury yields below some short term yields an unusual occurrence that many investors see as a warning sign of recession investors are also raising their bets that the federal reserve will need to cut interest rates later in 2019 to help the economy less than a year after it had been raising rates to get them closer to normal the fact that the president is willing to use tariffs as a weapon can really cause damage to business confidence hodge said you ve got to be wondering who s

washington president donald trump has once again turned to tariffs to try to get his way with a u s trading partner this time the target is mexico trump plans to impose 5 tariffs on mexican imports starting june 10 and to ratchet them up to 25 by oct 1 if the mexicans don t do more to stop the surge of central american migrants across the southern u s border tariffs have become one of trump s favourite policy tools the president who calls himself a tariff man has slapped the levies on imported steel aluminum dishwashers and solar panels he s also imposed them on 250 billion worth of chinese goods in a dispute over china s aggressive campaign to challenge american technological dominance and he s planning to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese imports that he hasn t already targeted before trump tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries when nations tended to focus on keeping imports out and exporting as much as they could more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ q are we in a trade war economists have no set definition of a trade war but with the world s two largest economies now slapping potentially punishing tariffs on each other it looks as if a trade war has arrived all told trump has threatened to hit as much as 550 billion worth of china s exports to the u s with punitive tariffs that s more than the 506 billion in goods that china shipped to the united states last year it s not uncommon for countries even close allies to fight over trade in specific products the united states and canada for example have squabbled for decades over softwood lumber but the u s and china are fighting over much broader issues like china s requirements that american companies share advanced technology to access china s market and the overall u s trade deficit with china so far neither side has shown any sign of bending ___ q so what are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they re typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller in the united states tariffs also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 per cent to parachutes 3 per cent sometimes the u s will impose additional duties on foreign imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ q do other countries have higher tariffs than the united states most key u s trading partners do not have significantly higher average tariffs according to an analysis by greg daco at oxford economics u s tariffs on imported goods adjusted for trade volumes average 2 4 per cent above japan s 2 per cent and just below the 3 per cent for the european union and 3 1 per cent for canada the comparable figures for mexico and china are higher both have higher duties that top 4 per cent trump has complained about the 270 per cent duty that canada imposes on dairy products but the united states has its own ultra high tariffs 168 per cent on peanuts and 350 per cent on tobacco ___ q what are tariffs supposed to accomplish two things raise government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the establishment of the federal income tax in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for the u s government from 1790 to 1860 for example they produced 90 per cent of federal revenue according to clashing over commerce a history of us trade policy by douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast last year tariffs accounted for only about 1 per cent of federal revenue in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the u s government collected 34 6 billion in customs duties and fees the white house office of management and budget expects tariffs to fetch 40 4 billion this year tariffs also are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive they also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices tariffs fell out of favour as global trade expanded after world war ii the formation of the world trade organization and the advent of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement among the u s mexico and canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether ___ q why are tariffs making a comeback after years of trade agreements that bound

chiapas state mexico president donald trump plans to impose 5 tariffs on mexican imports starting june 10 and to ratchet them up to 25 by oct 1 if the mexicans don t do more to stop the surge of central american migrants across the southern u s border ap photo marco ugarte file the associated press washington ap president donald trump has once again turned to tariffs to try to get his way with a u s trading partner this time the target is mexico trump plans to impose 5 tariffs on mexican imports starting june 10 and to ratchet them up to 25 by oct 1 if the mexicans don t do more to stop the surge of central american migrants across the southern u s border tariffs have become one of trump s favorite policy tools the president who calls himself a tariff man has slapped the levies on imported steel aluminum dishwashers and solar panels he s also imposed them on 250 billion worth of chinese goods in a dispute over china s aggressive campaign to challenge american technological dominance and he s planning to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese imports that he hasn t already targeted advertisement before trump tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries when nations tended to focus on keeping imports out and exporting as much as they could more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ q are we in a trade war economists have no set definition of a trade war but with the world s two largest economies now slapping potentially punishing tariffs on each other it looks as if a trade war has arrived all told trump has threatened to hit as much as 550 billion worth of china s exports to the u s with punitive tariffs that s more than the 506 billion in goods that china shipped to the united states last year it s not uncommon for countries even close allies to fight over trade in specific products the united states and canada for example have squabbled for decades over softwood lumber but the u s and china are fighting over much broader issues like china s requirements that american companies share advanced technology to access china s market and the overall u s trade deficit with china so far neither side has shown any sign of bending advertisement ___ q so what are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they re typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller in the united states tariffs also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional duties on foreign imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ q do other countries have higher tariffs than the united states most key u s trading partners do not have significantly higher average tariffs according to an analysis by greg daco at oxford economics u s tariffs on imported goods adjusted for trade volumes average 2 4 percent above japan s 2 percent and just below the 3 percent for the european union and 3 1 percent for canada the comparable figures for mexico and china are higher both have higher duties that top 4 percent trump has complained about the 270 percent duty that canada imposes on dairy products but the united states has its own ultra high tariffs 168 percent on peanuts and 350 percent on tobacco advertisement ___ q what are tariffs supposed to accomplish two things raise government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the establishment of the federal income tax in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for the u s government from 1790 to 1860 for example they produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to clashing over commerce a history of us trade policy by douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast last year tariffs accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the u s government collected 34 6 billion in customs duties and fees the white house office of management and budget expects tariffs to fetch 40 4 billion this year tariffs also are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive they also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices tariffs fell out of favor as global trade expanded after world war ii the formation of the world trade organization and the advent of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement among the u s mexico and canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether ___ q why are tariffs making a comeback after years of trade agreements that bound the countries of the world more closely and erased restrictions on trade a populist backlash has grown against globalization this was evident in trump s 2016 election and the british vote that year to leave the european union both surprise setbacks for the free trade establishment advertisement critics note that big corporations in rich countries exploited looser rules to move factories to china and other low wage countries then shipped goods back to their wealthy home countries while paying low tariffs or none at all since china joined the wto in 2001 the united states has shed 3 1 million factory jobs though many economists attribute much of that loss not just to trade but to robots and other technologies that replace human workers trump campaigned on a pledge to rewrite trade agreements and crack down on china mexico and other countries he blames what he calls their abusive trade policies for america s persistent trade deficits 566 billion last year most economists by contrast say the deficit simply reflects the reality that the united states spends more than it saves by imposing tariffs he is beginning to turn his hard line campaign rhetoric into action ___ q are tariffs a wise policy most economists trump s trade adviser peter navarro is a notable exception say no the tariffs drive up the cost of imports and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise their prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported components some u s companies that buy steel are complaining that trump s tariffs put them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer their products at lower prices more broadly economists say trade restrictions make the

culiacan mexico ap tomato exporter sergio esquer peiro spent much of friday in hastily called meetings with other stunned growers trying to evaluate the potential fallout of u s president donald trump s threat to slap coercive tariffs on all imports from mexico the sudden announcement stunned observers on both sides of the border and prompted president andrés manuel lópez obrador to dispatch his top diplomat to washington on for talks seeking to head off the proposed tariffs already he and others were having to contend with a 17 56 tariff on tomatoes imposed after washington announced in march it was ending a longstanding agreement over alleged mexican dumping of the fruit if the new duties do take effect esquer is looking at another 5 being slapped on his products potentially increasing to 25 in subsequent months unless mexico does more to stop illegal migration through its territory by a june 10 deadline per trump s demand right now more than anything there is a reaction of disbelief with everything that is going on esquer who s been sending tomatoes and other crops to the united states for 60 years told the associated press by phone during a break in the meetings president andrés manuel lópez obrador said mexico won t panic over the proposed tariffs and dispatched his top diplomat to washington on friday for talks seeking to head them off but economists and those whose livelihoods depend on the deeply intertwined trade relationship worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year worry that stiff duties could have dramatic negative consequences and potentially spark a trade war it also goes against the spirit there is between both countries the agreements we have the bilateral trade we have which is very successful esquer continued on the other hand we ll have to wait for the reaction of u s exporters to mexico because they are also going to see their exports threatened if mexico launches some kind of mirror policy from berries and automobiles to machinery and household appliances all of mexico s exports stand to be hit with the tariffs avocado growers in michoacan electronics factory workers in tamaulipas across the border from texas auto parts exporters all would feel the pinch esquero who does business from the tomato growing northwestern state of sinaloa said it s not just businessmen who stand to lose since mexico s estimated 700 tomato exporters are responsible for directly generating some 450 000 jobs according to mexico s agriculture department last year some 2 billion in tomatoes were exported to the united states second only to tequila and ahead of avocados the threat also throws into question the future of the usmca trade deal between the u s mexico and canada hammered out in months of contentious negotiations as a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s most touted achievements trump s threat came the same day mexico announced it would begin the process of ratifying the usmca and less than two weeks after it successfully negotiated the lifting of u s steel and aluminum tariffs that had been a roadblock to final approval for the trade deal it would really have a terrible impact on our producers and our exporters said kenneth smith ramos who led then president enrique peña nieto s delegation to usmca talks and is now an international trade consultant at mexico city based agon and it would hurt u s producers as well because they rely a lot on mexican inputs for their production he added so it would reduce their competitiveness and force them to raise prices which would ultimately of course hit consumers that means people like chuck sholtis ceo of el paso texas based plastic molding technology inc which employs 100 people most of its business involves plastic injection molding for automotive electronics and business products for maquiladoras factories in mexico that are run by foreign companies sholtis said his company has already suffered from u s steel tariffs on china that increased the costs of their tools and it s also been hit by slowdowns at ports of entry sholtis said the united states has found a niche in high tech specialized manufacturing that s part of a global supply chain he fears that if more tariffs like this are implemented or if the usmca doesn t take effect the united states will lose its edge in manufacturing he s also worried about possible recession in mexico and the united states it s illogical sholtis said tariffs go against one of the stated goals of the administration to help manufacturing and thereby create high skilled manufacturing jobs the economic impact for mexico was swift with the peso down more than 3 against the u s dollar friday u s stocks likewise tumbled on wall street initial macroeconomic projections from economists were also chilling analyst alfredo coutiño of moody s analytics said mexican exports to the u s totaled 358 billion last year or 80 of all goods the country sold overseas over the course of a year he said a 5 tariff would represent about 18 billion in damage or 1 5 of mexico s gdp while a 25 tariff would amount to 90 billion or 7 3 of gdp banco base estimated that a 5 tariff could knock 2 85 percentage points off growth of mexico s exports but said a weaker peso would help compensate such tariffs would likely push mexico into a recession as well as disrupt regional supply chains and hurt investor confidence oxford economics economist gregory daco wrote in a report coutiño said mexico could impose retaliatory penalties sparking a tariff war a second less aggressive but potentially more effective option would be to allow the peso to depreciate to the point where the tariffs would be neutralized he added via twitter trump argued that mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done mexico already has implemented policies and actions to discourage irregular migration last month it raided the latest caravan of mostly central american migrants traveling through the southern state of chiapas arresting hundreds and effectively breaking it up there have been no significant caravans since then with many migrants saying they now fear to travel in large groups mexico also has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more with seemingly endless waits for permits that would allow them to travel legally through the country but sealing its porous southern border with guatemala is probably impossible because mexico lacks sufficient infrastructure to completely patrol a frontier that includes a river passing through dense jungle we are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy lópez obrador said friday morning while making no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly central american immigrants transiting mexico to reach the u s border we have to help so that they don t enter the united states illegally but we also have to do it respecting human rights said lópez obrador nothing authoritarian they re human beings lópez obrador espouses a longer term holistic approach focused on improving security development and economic opportunity in the migrants countries of origin especially honduras guatemala and el salvador for now lópez obrador is betting on diplomacy and dialogue foreign relations secretary marcelo ebrard announced talks would take place next wednesday in washington with him and u s secretary of state mike pompeo leading their respective nations delegations there is a disposition for dialogue ebrard tweeted we will be firm and we will defend the

american consumers would pay a hefty price if president donald trump carries out his latest tariff threat against mexico but that s just one of many issues created by the president s pledge to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on one of the country s largest trading partners trump said via tweet on thursday he would impose tariffs of 5 percent on all mexican imports beginning june 10 in response to the flow of migrants over the southern u s border a subsequent white house statement said the tariffs would rise incrementally up to 25 percent by oct 1 unless mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory the uncertainty caused financial markets to plummet and threatened to send stocks lower for the sixth week in a row this is just the latest worry to put on the fire for investors said ryan detrick senior market strategist for lpl financial can we really fight two trade wars at the same time the prospect of fighting trade wars on multiple fronts spooks investors and executives alike as we are all fighting to develop plans to exit or to reduce our exposure to china one of our options mexico is now equally in jeopardy said rick helfenbein president and ceo of the american apparel footwear association this could roil u s and global financial markets which could see this as a signal that trump is leading us in the direction of a global trade war if that were to happen the u s economy could get hit hard said desmond lachman resident fellow at the american enterprise institute a right leaning think tank from a consumer perspective everything from cars to vegetables would get more expensive the u s imports 53 billion worth of autos from mexico and the country also is a major supplier of produce electronics and apparel including more than one third of men s and boy s jeans according to helfenbein prices will go up sales will go down jobs will be lost he said this has a devastating effect on our industry a lot of companies in the u s not just retailers treat north america as a unified market said david french senior vice president of government relations at the national retail federation it opens a new front in uncertainty for retailers but really for the u s economy president trump s attempt to bully mexico has horrified u s businesses as well as mexican political leaders said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics we expect the market to keep falling until the president blinks lachlan estimated that a 25 percent tariff on all mexican imports could add 0 4 percent to inflation but even more than just the health of the economy is at stake it borders more on the crazy bill daley former u s secretary of commerce under president bill clinton said on cnbc s squawk box on friday characterizing trump s mexico tariff threat as throwing gas on a fire the really shocking thing about this from a political standpoint is this is an abrupt reversal of everything the administration has been signaling about its top legislative priority said phil levy senior fellow on the global economy at the chicago council on global affairs levy pointed out that on thursday u s trade representative robert lighthizer asked congress to begin the ratification process for the united states mexico canada agreement usmca trump s replacement to the north american free trade agreement the office of the u s trade representative has called the trade pact a mutually beneficial win for north american workers farmers ranchers and businesses that would create a more level playing field for american exports now its passage is in jeopardy although acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney told reporters on thursday the two are absolutely not linked and said these are not tariffs as part of a trade dispute experts disagree saying trump absolutely risks derailing the pact slapping tariffs on mexico would almost certainly be deemed illegal under world trade organization rules trade experts on both the right and the left say this is alarming because it sends a message to all u s trading partners that the president has no compunctions about breaking treaties even ones he orchestrated it s a clear signal the president does not feel bound by trade agreements levy said as the threat of a full on trade war with china grows beijing is more likely to dig in if its trade negotiators believe trump would extract concessions in order to make a deal only to turn around and break his word in the eyes of the outside world this means that the u s is now the world s biggest rogue trader shepherdson said this has far reaching implications that could leave the u s with a tarnished reputation on the global stage well after trump s presidency is over a legacy that could take a long time to overcome this action would further undermine the rule based international trade system that the u s so painfully put together in the post war period lachman said does this seem like the extent of the trade problems we re going to have levy said this says no we re going to pick trade wars anywhere there s something that annoys the president
culiacan mexico ap tomato exporter sergio esquer peiro spent much of friday in hastily called meetings with other stunned growers trying to evaluate the potential fallout of u s president donald trump s threat to slap coercive tariffs on all imports from mexico the sudden announcement caught observers on both sides of the border by surprise and prompted president andrés manuel lópez obrador to dispatch his top diplomat to washington for talks seeking to head off the proposed tariffs obrador said mexico won t panic over the threatened hike but economists and those whose livelihoods depend on the trade relationship worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year worry that stiff duties could have dramatic negative consequences and potentially spark a trade war between the neighboring countries already esquer and other exporters were having to contend with a 17 56 tariff on tomatoes imposed after washington announced in march it was ending a longstanding agreement over alleged mexican dumping of the fruit if the new duties do take effect esquer is looking at another 5 being slapped on his products potentially increasing to 25 in subsequent months unless mexico does more to stop illegal migration through its territory by a june 10 deadline per trump s demand right now more than anything there is a reaction of disbelief with everything that is going on esquer who s been sending tomatoes and other crops to the united states for 60 years told the associated press by phone during a break in the meetings it also goes against the spirit there is between both countries the agreements we have the bilateral trade we have which is very successful esquer continued on the other hand we ll have to wait for the reaction of u s exporters to mexico because they are also going to see their exports threatened if mexico launches some kind of mirror policy from berries and automobiles to machinery and household appliances all of mexico s exports stand to be hit with the tariffs avocado growers in michoacan electronics factory workers in tamaulipas across the border from texas auto parts exporters all would feel the pinch esquer who does business from the tomato growing northwestern state of sinaloa said it s not just businessmen who stand to lose since mexico s estimated 700 tomato exporters are responsible for directly generating some 450 000 jobs according to mexico s agriculture department last year some 2 billion in tomatoes were exported to the united states second only to tequila and ahead of avocados the threat also throws into question the future of the usmca trade deal between the u s mexico and canada hammered out in months of contentious negotiations as a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s most touted achievements trump s threat came the same day mexico announced it would begin the process of ratifying the usmca and less than two weeks after it successfully negotiated the lifting of u s steel and aluminum tariffs that had been a roadblock to final approval for the trade deal it would really have a terrible impact on our producers and our exporters said kenneth smith ramos who led then president enrique peña nieto s delegation to usmca talks and is now an international trade consultant at mexico city based agon and it would hurt u s producers as well because they rely a lot on mexican inputs for their production he added so it would reduce their competitiveness and force them to raise prices which would ultimately of course hit consumers that means people like chuck sholtis ceo of el paso texas based plastic molding technology inc which employs 100 people most of its business involves plastic injection molding for automotive electronics and business products for maquiladoras factories in mexico that are run by foreign companies sholtis said his company has already suffered from u s steel tariffs on china that increased the costs of their tools and it s also been hit by slowdowns at ports of entry sholtis said the united states has found a niche in high tech specialized manufacturing that s part of a global supply chain he fears that if more tariffs like this are implemented or if the usmca doesn t take effect the united states will lose its edge in manufacturing he s also worried about possible recession in mexico and the united states it s illogical sholtis said tariffs go against one of the stated goals of the administration to help manufacturing and thereby create high skilled manufacturing jobs the economic impact for mexico was swift with the peso down more than 3 against the u s dollar friday u s stocks likewise tumbled on wall street initial macroeconomic projections from economists were also chilling analyst alfredo coutiño of moody s analytics said mexican exports to the u s totaled 358 billion last year or 80 of all goods the country sold overseas over the course of a year he said a 5 tariff would represent about 18 billion in damage or 1 5 of mexico s gdp while a 25 tariff would amount to 90 billion or 7 3 of gdp banco base estimated that a 5 tariff could knock 2 85 percentage points off growth of mexico s exports but said a weaker peso would help compensate such tariffs would likely push mexico into a recession as well as disrupt regional supply chains and hurt investor confidence oxford economics economist gregory daco wrote in a report coutiño said mexico could impose retaliatory penalties sparking a tariff war a second less aggressive but potentially more effective option would be to allow the peso to depreciate to the point where the tariffs would be neutralized he added via twitter trump argued that mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done mexico already has implemented policies and actions to discourage irregular migration last month it raided the latest caravan of mostly central american migrants traveling through the southern state of chiapas arresting hundreds and effectively breaking it up there have been no significant caravans since then with many migrants saying they now fear to travel in large groups mexico also has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more with seemingly endless waits for permits that would allow them to travel legally through the country but sealing its porous southern border with guatemala is probably impossible because mexico lacks sufficient infrastructure to completely patrol a frontier that includes a river passing through dense jungle we are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy lópez obrador said friday morning while making no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly central american immigrants transiting mexico to reach the u s border we have to help so that they don t enter the united states illegally but we also have to do it respecting human rights said lópez obrador nothing authoritarian they re human beings lópez obrador espouses a longer term holistic approach focused on improving security development and economic opportunity in the migrants countries of origin especially honduras guatemala and el salvador for now lópez obrador is betting on diplomacy and dialogue foreign relations secretary marcelo ebrard announced talks would take place next wednesday in washington with him and u s secretary of state mike pompeo leading their respective nations delegations there is a disposition for dialogue ebrard tweeted we will be firm and we will defend the dignity of mexico in ciudad juarez across from el paso texas 21 year old jennifer del carmen pérez hernández

a concern weighing on the markets and causing investors to contemplate whether the us is next advertisement advertisement in this article i will discuss some low to negative beta options to hedge anyone s portfolio in these volatile times chicago mercantile exchange the cme group is the largest commodity derivatives exchange in the world based out of downtown chicago it offers firms a wide variety of derivatives and futures to hedge their business the exchange is also used by speculative traders who believe they can beat the market as the markets have become increasingly volatile over the past month and the cme has shown investors an almost 10 gain while the s p 500 is down roughly 5 since the beginning of may cme has a beta very close to zero making it a safer bet in rough market waters most of the volume that is traded on the cme are interest rate derivatives which are used to help businesses hedge floating interest rates expected future borrowing as well as expected future lending they also offer futures and options in equities foreign exchange agriculture and commodities when the market breaks down companies tend to hedge more of their business due to the perceived future risk associated with a market downturn speculative traders on the cme exchange are also trading larger volumes because of the increased volatility something every day trader is waiting for the cme group s revenue is driven almost entirely by volume and as the markets break volumes increase for the reasons mentioned above volume has consistently increased over the past 5 years by an average annual rate of 9 cme globex has primarily driven this growth this is cme s online platform that makes it easier for any business to hedge no matter the size the past 5 years have been relatively low volatility so when the markets hit the fan expect cme to reap the benefits cme is currently trading just off its 10 year forward p e high i would wait to put a long position on cme until the valuation comes down a bit look to buy once cme drops below the 180 level this low beta exchange is expanding and will make not only a good hedge but also an excellent long term investment at the right price anglogold ashanti limited gold prices have an inverse relationship with the equity market because of its flight to quality characteristics as you might guess gold miners and gold move together au has a beta of 1 implying that it will show investors returns when the broader equity market isn t you can see this inverse relationship play out in this past month as au attains 8 returns and the s p 500 slides almost 5 au is trading at favorable multiples with its forward p e of 11 2x below its 10 year median and far below the gold mining industry average north of 30x if you factor expected growth into its p e multiple the investment looks even more attractive trading at a peg of 0 6x significantly below the industry average of 5x anglogold ashanti is expected to grow its eps by 90 this year and 21 in 2020 analysts have raised these estimates considerably over the past 2 months thrusting au to a zacks rank 1 strong buy pinnacle west capital investors often use utility companies as investment safe havens because of their consistent cash flows and large dividend payouts falling interest rates which we have been seeing are also good for utility companies because of the capital intensive nature of their business causing them to carry a lot of debt on their balance sheet historically during market downturns utility stocks have outperformed the broader equity market pinnacle west capital is a utility holding company whose subsidiaries provide arizona with electricity pnw is responsible for generating and distributing electricity to 1 2 million customers around the phoenix area pnw is focusing on expanding its customer base and updating its infrastructure with renewable energy being a focal point they are planning on investing roughly 4 billion over the next 3 years in order to make this happen over the past decade pnw has consistently grown its top and bottom lines as well as expand its margins something most utility companies can t boast pnw has performed exceptionally well over past 52 week returning investors over 20 and outperforming both the industry average and the s p 500 analysts are have raised long term eps outlook for pnw over the last 60 days propelling this stock into a zacks rank 2 buy an expanding utility company that still pays out a dividend north of 3 is hard to come by pnw is about 5 off its all time high which it hit last week and i believe now is the perfect time to add this low beta utility company to your portfolio take away market volatility is inevitable and the best way to protect your portfolio from exacerbated losses is to hedge it with low to negative beta options you could use a growing exchange like cme for long term portfolio returns combined with a low beta hedge at the right price au and other gold mining stocks with a negative correlation to the market will allow your portfolio to have some profitability even in the worst downturns a utility company like pnw will give your portfolio sustainable

increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive they also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices tariffs fell out of favor as global trade expanded after world

culiacan mexico ap tomato exporter sergio esquer peiro spent much of friday in hastily called meetings with other stunned growers trying to evaluate the potential fallout of u s president donald trump s threat to slap coercive tariffs on all imports from mexico the sudden announcement caught observers on both sides of the border by surprise and prompted president andrés manuel lópez obrador to dispatch his top diplomat to washington for talks seeking to head off the proposed tariffs obrador said mexico won t panic over the threatened hike but economists and those whose livelihoods depend on the trade relationship worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year worry that stiff duties could have dramatic negative consequences and potentially spark a trade war between the neighboring countries already esquer and other exporters were having to contend with a 17 56 tariff on tomatoes imposed after washington announced in march it was ending a longstanding agreement over alleged mexican dumping of the fruit if the new duties do take effect esquer is looking at another 5 being slapped on his products potentially increasing to 25 in subsequent months unless mexico does more to stop illegal migration through its territory by a june 10 deadline per trump s demand right now more than anything there is a reaction of disbelief with everything that is going on esquer who s been sending tomatoes and other crops to the united states for 60 years told the associated press by phone during a break in the meetings it also goes against the spirit there is between both countries the agreements we have the bilateral trade we have which is very successful esquer continued on the other hand we ll have to wait for the reaction of u s exporters to mexico because they are also going to see their exports threatened if mexico launches some kind of mirror policy advertisement advertisement from berries and automobiles to machinery and household appliances all of mexico s exports stand to be hit with the tariffs avocado growers in michoacan electronics factory workers in tamaulipas across the border from texas auto parts exporters all would feel the pinch esquer who does business from the tomato growing northwestern state of sinaloa said it s not just businessmen who stand to lose since mexico s estimated 700 tomato exporters are responsible for directly generating some 450 000 jobs according to mexico s agriculture department last year some 2 billion in tomatoes were exported to the united states second only to tequila and ahead of avocados the threat also throws into question the future of the usmca trade deal between the u s mexico and canada hammered out in months of contentious negotiations as a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s most touted achievements trump s threat came the same day mexico announced it would begin the process of ratifying the usmca and less than two weeks after it successfully negotiated the lifting of u s steel and aluminum tariffs that had been a roadblock to final approval for the trade deal advertisement advertisement it would really have a terrible impact on our producers and our exporters said kenneth smith ramos who led then president enrique peña nieto s delegation to usmca talks and is now an international trade consultant at mexico city based agon and it would hurt u s producers as well because they rely a lot on mexican inputs for their production he added so it would reduce their competitiveness and force them to raise prices which would ultimately of course hit consumers story continues that means people like chuck sholtis ceo of el paso texas based plastic molding technology inc which employs 100 people most of its business involves plastic injection molding for automotive electronics and business products for maquiladoras factories in mexico that are run by foreign companies sholtis said his company has already suffered from u s steel tariffs on china that increased the costs of their tools and it s also been hit by slowdowns at ports of entry sholtis said the united states has found a niche in high tech specialized manufacturing that s part of a global supply chain he fears that if more tariffs like this are implemented or if the usmca doesn t take effect the united states will lose its edge in manufacturing he s also worried about possible recession in mexico and the united states it s illogical sholtis said tariffs go against one of the stated goals of the administration to help manufacturing and thereby create high skilled manufacturing jobs the economic impact for mexico was swift with the peso down more than 3 against the u s dollar friday u s stocks likewise tumbled on wall street advertisement advertisement initial macroeconomic projections from economists were also chilling analyst alfredo coutiño of moody s analytics said mexican exports to the u s totaled 358 billion last year or 80 of all goods the country sold overseas over the course of a year he said a 5 tariff would represent about 18 billion in damage or 1 5 of mexico s gdp while a 25 tariff would amount to 90 billion or 7 3 of gdp banco base estimated that a 5 tariff could knock 2 85 percentage points off growth of mexico s exports but said a weaker peso would help compensate such tariffs would likely push mexico into a recession as well as disrupt regional supply chains and hurt investor confidence oxford economics economist gregory daco wrote in a report advertisement advertisement coutiño said mexico could impose retaliatory penalties sparking a tariff war a second less aggressive but potentially more effective option would be to allow the peso to depreciate to the point where the tariffs would be neutralized he added via twitter trump argued that mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done mexico already has implemented policies and actions to discourage irregular migration advertisement advertisement last month it raided the latest caravan of mostly central american migrants traveling through the southern state of chiapas arresting hundreds and effectively breaking it up there have been no significant caravans since then with many migrants saying they now fear to travel in large groups mexico also has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more with seemingly endless waits for permits that would allow them to travel legally through the country but sealing its porous southern border with guatemala is probably impossible because mexico lacks sufficient infrastructure to completely patrol

menafn gulf times in a recent project syndicate commentary james k galbraith of the university of texas at austin defends modern monetary theory and corrects some misunderstandings about the relationships among mmt federal deficits and central bank independence but galbraith does not explore what is perhaps the most important issue of all the political conditions needed to implement mmt effectively mmt owes its newfound relevance to the fact that deflation rather than inflation is becoming central banks main concern for a high debt high deficit economy like the united states deflation is an especially serious threat because it delays consumption and increases debtor anxiety consumers forego major purchases on the assumption that future prices will be lower homeowners with mortgages cut back their spending when they see home prices falling and the equity in their homes declining these cutbacks worry the federal reserve because they add to deflationary pressures and could trigger deeper spending cuts stock market declines and widespread deleveraging the fed s inability so far to reach its 2 target for annual inflation suggests that it lacks the means to overcome persistent disinflationary forces in the economy these forces include increased us market concentration which diminishes aggregate demand by weakening employee bargaining power and increasing income inequality population ageing inadequate investment in infrastructure and climate change abatement and technology driven labour displacement making matters worse us political gridlock assures continued commitment to economically exhausted strategies such as tax cuts for the rich at the expense of investment in education and other sources of long term growth these conditions cry out for significant changes in us government spending and tax policies mmt is seen as a way to accomplish the needed changes it holds that a government can spend as much as it wants if it borrows in its own currency and its central bank can buy as much of the government s debt as necessary as long as doing so doesn t generate unacceptably high inflation both tax cut advocates and supporters of public investment find little not to like mmt has been roundly criticised by economists across the political spectrum from kenneth rogoff and lawrence h summers of harvard university to paul krugman of the city university of new york all contend that it is a political argument masquerading as economic theory but galbraith and ray dalio of bridgewater associates see mmt differently dalio argues that mmt is real and more to the point it is an inevitable policy step in historically recurring debt cycle downturns in his book principles for navigating big debt crises dalio documents the steps that central banks have historically taken when faced with a booming economy that suddenly crumples under the weight of debt the first step monetary policy 1 or mp1 is to cut overnight official rates to stimulate credit and investment expansion the second mp2 is to buy government debt quantitative easing to support asset prices and prevent uncontrollable waves of deleveraging if mp1 and mp2 are insufficient to halt a downturn central banks take step three mmt which dalio calls mp3 and proceed to finance the spending priorities that political leaders deem most essential the priorities can range from financing major national projects to helicopter money transfers directly to consumers achieving political agreement on what to finance and how is essential for implementing mp3 effectively in a financial meltdown or other national emergency political unity and prompt action are essential unity requires a strong consensus on what should be financed speed requires the existence of a trusted institution to direct the spending in the early 1940s when the us entered world war ii and winning the war became the government s top priority the fed entered full mp3 mode it not only set short and long term rates for treasury bonds but also bought as much government debt as necessary to finance the war effort mp3 was possible because the war united the country politically and gave the roosevelt administration near authoritarian rule over the economy the core weakness of mp3 mmt advocacy is the absence of an explanation of how to achieve political unity on what to finance and how this absence is inexcusable total us debt as a share of gdp is approaching levels associated with past financial meltdowns and that doesn t even account for the hidden debts associated with infrastructure maintenance rising sea levels and unfunded pensions for the reasons dalio lays out a us debt crisis requiring some form of mp3 is all but inevitable the crucial question that any effort to achieve political unity must answer is what constitutes justifiable spending alexander hamilton america s first secretary of the treasury offered an answer in 1781 a national debt he wrote if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing a government s debt is excessive if it cannot be repaid because its proceeds were spent in ways that did not increase national wealth enough to do so debt resulting from tax cuts that are spent on mega yachts would almost certainly be excessive debt incurred to improve educational outcomes maintain essential infrastructure or address climate change would probably not be accordingly it will be easier to achieve political unity if mp3 proceeds are spent on priorities such as education infrastructure or climate the political test for justifying mp3 financed government spending is clear will future generations judge that the borrowing was not excessive most americans born well after wwii would say that the debt incurred to win that war was justified as was the debt that financed the construction of the interstate highway system which literally paved the way for stronger growth as the 1930s and 1940s show mp3 is a natural component of government responses to major debt downturns and the political crises they trigger we know much more about what contributes to economic growth and sustainability than we did in the first half of the twentieth century to speed recovery from the next downturn we need to identify now the types of spending that will contribute most to sustainable recovery and that in hindsight will be viewed as most justified by future

culiacan mexico ap tomato exporter sergio esquer peiro spent much of friday in hastily called meetings with other stunned growers trying to evaluate the potential fallout of u s president donald trump s threat to slap coercive tariffs on all imports from mexico the sudden announcement caught observers on both sides of the border by surprise and prompted president andrés manuel lópez obrador to dispatch his top diplomat to washington for talks seeking to head off the proposed tariffs obrador said mexico won t panic over the threatened hike but economists and those whose livelihoods depend on the trade relationship worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year worry that stiff duties could have dramatic negative consequences and potentially spark a trade war between the neighboring countries already esquer and other exporters were having to contend with a 17 56 tariff on tomatoes imposed after washington announced in march it was ending a longstanding agreement over alleged mexican dumping of the fruit if the new duties do take effect esquer is looking at another 5 being slapped on his products potentially increasing to 25 in subsequent months unless mexico does more to stop illegal migration through its territory by a june 10 deadline per trump s demand right now more than anything there is a reaction of disbelief with everything that is going on esquer who s been sending tomatoes and other crops to the united states for 60 years told the associated press by phone during a break in the meetings it also goes against the spirit there is between both countries the agreements we have the bilateral trade we have which is very successful esquer continued on the other hand we ll have to wait for the reaction of u s exporters to mexico because they are also going to see their exports threatened if mexico launches some kind of mirror policy from berries and automobiles to machinery and household appliances all of mexico s exports stand to be hit with the tariffs avocado growers in michoacan electronics factory workers in tamaulipas across the border from texas auto parts exporters all would feel the pinch esquer who does business from the tomato growing northwestern state of sinaloa said it s not just businessmen who stand to lose since mexico s estimated 700 tomato exporters are responsible for directly generating some 450 000 jobs according to mexico s agriculture department last year some 2 billion in tomatoes were exported to the united states second only to tequila and ahead of avocados the threat also throws into question the future of the usmca trade deal between the u s mexico and canada hammered out in months of contentious negotiations as a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s most touted achievements trump s threat came the same day mexico announced it would begin the process of ratifying the usmca and less than two weeks after it successfully negotiated the lifting of u s steel and aluminum tariffs that had been a roadblock to final approval for the trade deal it would really have a terrible impact on our producers and our exporters said kenneth smith ramos who led then president enrique peña nieto s delegation to usmca talks and is now an international trade consultant at mexico city based agon and it would hurt u s producers as well because they rely a lot on mexican inputs for their production he added so it would reduce their competitiveness and force them to raise prices which would ultimately of course hit consumers that means people like chuck sholtis ceo of el paso texas based plastic molding technology inc which employs 100 people most of its business involves plastic injection molding for automotive electronics and business products for maquiladoras factories in mexico that are run by foreign companies sholtis said his company has already suffered from u s steel tariffs on china that increased the costs of their tools and it s also been hit by slowdowns at ports of entry sholtis said the united states has found a niche in high tech specialized manufacturing that s part of a global supply chain he fears that if more tariffs like this are implemented or if the usmca doesn t take effect the united states will lose its edge in manufacturing he s also worried about possible recession in mexico and the united states it s illogical sholtis said tariffs go against one of the stated goals of the administration to help manufacturing and thereby create high skilled manufacturing jobs the economic impact for mexico was swift with the peso down more than 3 against the u s dollar friday u s stocks likewise tumbled on wall street initial macroeconomic projections from economists were also chilling analyst alfredo coutiño of moody s analytics said mexican exports to the u s totaled 358 billion last year or 80 of all goods the country sold overseas over the course of a year he said a 5 tariff would represent about 18 billion in damage or 1 5 of mexico s gdp while a 25 tariff would amount to 90 billion or 7 3 of gdp banco base estimated that a 5 tariff could knock 2 85 percentage points off growth of mexico s exports but said a weaker peso would help compensate such tariffs would likely push mexico into a recession as well as disrupt regional supply chains and hurt investor confidence oxford economics economist gregory daco wrote in a report coutiño said mexico could impose retaliatory penalties sparking a tariff war a second less aggressive but potentially more effective option would be to allow the peso to depreciate to the point where the tariffs would be neutralized he added via twitter trump argued that mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done mexico already has implemented policies and actions to discourage irregular migration last month it raided the latest caravan of mostly central american migrants traveling through the southern state of chiapas arresting hundreds and effectively breaking it up there have been no significant caravans since then with many migrants saying they now fear to travel in large groups mexico also has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more with seemingly endless waits for permits that would allow them to travel legally through the country but sealing its porous southern border with guatemala is probably impossible because mexico lacks sufficient infrastructure to completely patrol a frontier that includes a river passing through dense jungle we are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy lópez obrador said friday morning while making no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly central american immigrants transiting mexico to reach the u s border we have to help so that they don t enter the united states illegally but we also have to do it respecting human rights said lópez obrador nothing authoritarian they re human beings lópez obrador espouses a longer term holistic approach focused on improving security development and economic opportunity in the migrants countries of origin especially honduras guatemala and el salvador for now lópez obrador is betting on diplomacy and dialogue foreign relations secretary marcelo ebrard announced talks would take place next wednesday in washington with him and u s secretary of state mike pompeo leading their respective nations delegations there is a disposition for dialogue ebrard tweeted we will be firm and we will defend the dignity of mexico in ciudad juarez across from el paso texas 21 year old jennifer del carmen pérez hernández said she moved there three years ago because she couldn t find work in her home state of veracruz on the gulf coast pérez said when she first arrived she was told that if trump were elected staff cuts might be possible she s kept her job operates an upholstery machine specialized for cars so far but the tariff threat gives her new cause for concern i ve worked in sewing the three years that i ve been in juarez it s what i know pérez said if there are cuts and i have to find work elsewhere i would start at zero ___ associated press writers christopher sherman and peter orsi reported from

after a long delay the treasury department just released its latest semi annual report on global currency exchange policies the congressionally mandated report provides an assessment of whether foreign countries are undervaluing their currencies to gain a trade advantage the major takeaway from the report is that treasury has expanded the list of countries it is monitoring for exchange rate abuses however the department repeated its longstanding practice and once again found no currency manipulation by america s trade competitors in other words treasury believes that foreign central banks are not acting to push the u s dollar s value up to noncompetitive levels treasury is barking up the wrong tree however in the current market the dollar is indeed being driven up but by private capital inflows not central banks and it s making u s exports too expensive in global markets conversely the currencies of america s chief competitors japan china and europe are too low the result is that american made cars airplanes and other manufactured goods are getting priced out of the market through no fault of domestic u s companies the treasury department did acknowledge in its report that the dollar is overvalued and that other countries currencies are undervalued the report also recognized that the dollar s relative overvaluation drives the current u s trade deficit regrettably treasury offered no policy proposals to address this growing problem with america s global trade deficit continuing to climb the administration and congress must recognize that the 21st century s problem is no longer currency manipulation by foreign central banks instead a glut of private foreign capital is flowing into u s financial markets continually driving the dollar higher which allows foreign competitors to reap a windfall without lifting a finger wall street perpetually cheers this strong dollar but it is now working against american companies for those wondering why the u s trade deficit grew in 2018 despite president trump s aggressive trade intervention it s these capital inflows that are the root cause a wonkish explanation is needed to understand the problem in the 1970s and 80s japan and west germany followed a strategy that supercharged their economic growth they manipulated currency markets by buying dollar based assets and sold their own currencies at the same time the result was a rise in the dollar that made their exports comparably cheaper in the u s market in 1985 president reagan faced the largest trade deficit in u s history he responded to congressional pressure by negotiating with japan and west germany to stop their currency practices the resulting agreement the plaza accord devalued the dollar significantly while raising the value of the yen and the deutsche mark u s products became globally competitive and the u s trade deficit shrank in 1988 congress passed a law requiring the treasury department to issue twice yearly reports identifying countries that manipulate their currencies from the mid 1990s through 2015 china and other countries followed a similar nationalistic strategy buying dollars and selling their own currencies to gain a trade advantage but in recent years a global oversupply of private capital flowing into the u s has started to do the job for them some foreign countries use economic strategies to produce more than their citizens consume and they export the difference they generate trade surpluses and as a result accumulate progressively more savings than they invest at home those surplus savings flow into countries with trade deficits primarily the united states this flood of toxic waste capital as some economists describe it buys treasury bonds and u s stocks which drives the dollar higher and so the u s trade deficit gets worse as american exports become less competitive wall street is happy to accept these private capital inflows in exchange for the stocks and bonds their brokers sell but u s goods and services become too expensive in global markets harming workers and hurting economic growth american companies lose market share to foreign competitors both at home and abroad and they struggle to remain profitable cutting budgets for innovative research and wage increases it s the key problem facing main street today while treasury correctly found that there is no large scale currency manipulation occurring among central banks the department is focused on the wrong issue because these governments no longer need to push the dollar higher international banks and hedge funds are doing the work for them one solution is a market access charge to manage this toxic influx of foreign capital like a peak load charge during rush hour traffic a fee applied to incoming investment could slow foreign capital inflows gradually lowering the dollar to a trade balancing price america would become competitive again in international trade and maintain its global leadership president trump and treasury secretary mnuchin cannot eliminate the u s trade deficit until they focus on these excessive foreign capital inflows which are weaponizing the dollar against the interests of america s companies and workers solving this problem will allow the president to fulfill his campaign promise of narrowing the trade deficit and creating millions of good paying middle class u s jobs for many years to come michael stumo is ceo of the coalition for a prosperous america cpa

wednesday the central bank surprised some by effectively closing the door on an interest rate cut a move the bond markets didn t see coming and the following day carolyn wilkins the senior deputy

reputational risk looming over the bank of canada s latest policy decision was the release of statistics canada s tale of economic output in the first quarter statcan could have blown up the central bank s story instead the latest numbers confirmed it was true advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content two numbers stand out both pleasant surprises household spending jumped 0 9 per cent the strongest since 2017 and a little better than the quarterly average according to data that date to 1961 consumption accounts for about 60 per cent of gdp so our ability to grow as an economy is dictated to a significant degree by our willingness or ability to buy stuff the bank of canada has assumed for a long time that spending would slow under the weight of a decade long debt binge late last year household purchases slowed too much forcing the central bank to pause its plan to tug interest rates back to a more normal level so a sign of life is welcome suggesting that this year s impressive run of hiring data including some evidence that the hot labour market might finally be putting upward pressure on wages is offsetting the burden of households record debt load consumer spending bounced back strongly after a poor performance in the second half of 2018 matthew stewart director of economics at the conference board of canada said in an email he called the increase substantial and added that households may not be having as much difficulty with their substantial debt burden and rising interest rates as many feared advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the other important indicator was business investment canadian companies spent 78 4 billion on new machinery and equipment in the first quarter a nine per cent surge from the previous quarter and the most since early 2008 the quarter to quarter increase was the biggest since 1996 suggesting that canadian companies which have been piling up profits for years finally got off the sidelines poloz said that would happen the bank of canada s surveys of business intentions kept showing that executives were gearing up to invest the resolution of the new north american trade agreement eased worries about the terms on which commerce would be based on the continent and federal tax cuts on investment also likely created a tailwind the early year slowdown will be temporary veronica clark economist citibank investment is key because it signals future activity companies are spending because they are struggling to keep up with orders see an opportunity to become more productive or both any of those scenarios bode well for the current quarter and the rest of the year assuming an external shock doesn t knock the economy off course advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the composition of growth was actually stronger than we had anticipated with significant support from consumption and business investment veronica clark an economist at citibank said in a note to her clients this reinforces our view that the early year slowdown will be temporary to be sure an external shock remains a present danger traders re upped their bets that the bank of canada will be forced to cut interest rates putting more weight on donald trump s decision to escalate the trade wars than all the positive indicators contained within the latest gdp report by linking punitive duties on mexico to the flight of refugees from central america trump risks erasing whatever positive sentiment he instilled by ending aluminum and steel duties on shipments from canada and mexico and the conflict with china feels like it could get worse before it gets better the volatility of trade policy is why there was no indication from the bank of canada this week that it intends to resume raising interest rates wilkins reminded reporters in calgary that the benchmark rate still is lower than inflation meaning real interest rates are negative that s not normal and explains why policymakers will push borrowing costs higher as soon as conditions allow but those conditions won t exist as long as the trade wars rage fourth quarter gdp was crushed by a big drop in exports as

for some time now i have been sounding the alarm of an impending major economic crisis that may hit globally by the year 2020 contrary to reports by some analysts and experts i have good reasons to predict that the next crisis is going to be more devastating than the last one in 2008 most likely and similar to the previous one the new crisis will start in the united states and will last longer with far more devastating impact on western economies causing stagflation and leading to bankruptcies nations around the globe especially in europe have lost confidence in the united states ability to lead in issues of international finance trade diplomacy and war these nations are quietly dismantling the seven decade old alliance with the united states building instead an alternative system of bilateral trade furthermore the us dollar has been losing ground for some years now to other currencies bank of england governor mark carney announced in january 2019 ultimately we will have reserve currencies other than the us dollar similarly according to alfred mccoy historian and professor of history at the university of wisconsin the collapse of the dollar will mean soaring prices ever rising unemployment and a continuing decline in real wages throughout the 2020s domestic divisions widen into violent clashes and divisive debates often over symbolic insubstantial issues it is no surprise therefore that when asked about a possible repeat of the 2008 crisis former uk prime minister gordon brown stated we are in danger of sleepwalking into a future crisis there is going to have to be a severe awakening to the escalation of risks but we are in a leaderless world the cooperation that was seen in 2008 would not be possible in a post 2018 crisis both in terms of central banks and governments working together we would have a blame sharing exercise rather than solving the problem thus my prediction is that 2020 will deliver an unparallelled global economic and political crisis in other words not only will the uncoordinated economic policies of advanced economies come into play but so will misguided political decisions and policies which will set the ground for greater economic plight it is possible that china s state ownership and control of the banking system will fare better the government will react or pro act to deal with any adverse impact through a variety of ways especially since it has not yet reached its growth potential i also predict that at least five european countries will suffer from the crisis in the coming year for the reasons stated above yet the single euro currency will be preserved meanwhile brazil russia india china and korea will grow at a steady rate during the next 10 years i also believe that in 10 years some of the african countries will become more developed and that the economies of the gulf cooperation council region will continue to grow mainly because of increased oil revenues the sequence of events in my view will be we are looking at a global economic crisis leading to stagflation the evolving bilateral technological trade economic ip rights political and military conflicts will culminate into a real confrontation globally the crisis and emerging conflicts will lead to the third world war between the us and china the us and china will meet to end the war as all wars end with agreements a new world order governed by the g 2 us and china will emerge the arab region will witness a renaissance that will herald a global marshal like economic plan leading to a global economic recovery and prosperity based on the above my best advice is to prepare for a recession even if it may not happen i am advocating to others what i have already started implementing within tag global the prescription for an uncertain future is to focus on resilience to withstand uncertainties and shocks by building focused specific growth strategies by adopting and enhancing technical and innovation competencies by emphasising sustainability and by being proactively cooperative the focus should be on the drivers of long term not short term symptomatic measures initiating action rather than just reacting to developments as they come the writer is chairman of talal abu ghazaleh organisation he contributed this article to the jordan times
smart gold investors ask crisis or zombification many people worry about the replay of the last economic crisis but what if we look not in the direction from which the threat will come what if we fight the last war we invite you to read our today s article about the possibility that the endgame will not to be a 2008 style financial crisis but a slow painful and unstoppable zombification of the global economy and find out how it would affect the gold market we know that there is still a lot of time to halloween but please come with us to the cemetery to meet some zombie friends who knows maybe we will learn something about the economy and the gold market from them the current expansion is probably the most hated period of prosperity since the very end of the great recession the pundits have been worried about the next economic crisis we were told that the recession was just around the corner the sellers of precious metals often aroused such fears we have been hearing it for ten years but this time is said to be different the us yield curve has inverted but only temporarily and american industrial production has recently weakened further china s economy has slowed down while the german engine has jammed our world has clearly moved from global synchronization to global slowdown shouldn t we worry about recession then perhaps but what if we look not in the direction from which the threat will come what if we fight the last war what if the endgame will not to be a 2008 style financial crisis but a slow painful and unstoppable zombification of the global economy in other words what if we are boiling frogs which do not feel the lethal heat just consider japan its economy has risen just 25 percent from 1995 as one can see in the chart below it has very old and ageing population and enormous public debt indeed japan with the level of debt above 250 percent of gdp leads the inglorious ranking of the most indebted countries in the world chart 1 real gdp growth for japan red line italy green line and the us blue line from 1995 to 2018 index 1995 100 europe seems to follow japan its population is also old and quickly ageing while the economy is heavily dependent on the commercial banks but the banking system is still fragile with high percentage of non performing loans especially in italy the country is also heavily indebted and experienced almost no real growth over the last twenty years see the chart above the situation in the us is better but still disturbing just think about these developments inflation is stubbornly low the real interest rates remain in a downward trend the labor productivity is sluggish while both the public and private debts are accumulating and the business dynamism measured by the firm entry and exit rates is on the decline since the great recession as the chart below shows chart 2 u s establishment entry rate blue line and exit rate red line from 1977 to 2014 what would the zombification of the economy imply for the gold market the full blown crisis and deep recession would be much better for gold than slow petrification of the economy you cannot fall if you did not take off the ground in other words the next global economic crisis is not imminent instead we could enjoy slower and slower growth until the complete stagnation let s repeat something we pointed out several times that s true that the current expansion is exceptionally long but this is precisely because it is uniquely slow if you are a snail it takes more time to climb the mountain for you than for the rabbit however zombification means low real interest rates gold shines when bond yields are low and the greenback would depreciate then at least against developing countries currencies moreover the zombified economy is kept artificially alive by monetary and fiscal stimuli the interest rates are low while the debts are high the room for further maneuver is limited and the economy is more vulnerable to external shocks just think about japan or italy these countries were not immune to the great recession actually they suffered much more than the us when the crisis began the implication is that the zombification of the economy does not make the economy immune to the business cycle the day of reckoning will still come but it may come a bit later but when it arrives the negative consequences will be more severe we do not mean necessarily deep recession as central banks will do anything to support the economy but that the followed recovery will be very soft in the environment of no growth zero interest rates gold may flourish inflation may be not high but it will be positive so we will face stagflation which historically remember the 1970s was positive for the yellow metal however investors should acknowledge that europe is much more zombified than the us so unfortunately for the gold prices the greenback should remain the king of the fiat currencies thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis

us to hit mexico with tariffs tax to rise till immigrant flow across border stops new york times news service and reuters president trump said on thursday that he would impose a 5 per cent tariff on all imported goods from mexico beginning on june 10 a tax that would gradually increase until the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border stopped the announcement which trump made on his twitter feed said the tariffs would be in place until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop advertisement in a presidential statement that followed he said that tariffs would be raised to 10 per cent on july 1 if the crisis persists and then by an additional 5 per cent each month for three months they would remain at 25 per cent until mexico acted he said speaking in mexico city on friday mexican deputy economy minister luz maria de la mora said mexico will defend its interests against sweeping tariffs threatened by trump who uses trade like a pinata that he hits to solve any problem de la mora said the multilateral trading system and the existing nafta trade agreement gave mexico the tools it needs to respond to tariffs adding that was not something that her government wanted to do an across the board tariff on all mexican goods would exact a serious toll on american consumers and corporations and is likely to generate significant opposition among businesses rufus yerxa the president of the national foreign trade council which represents the nation s largest exporters called the move a colossal blunder the president s threat escalated his immigration fight with mexico and is a significant move against an american ally that essentially dared the mexican government to risk economic catastrophe on both sides of the border if it did not capitulate to the demands of the us president but while trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority his announcement on thursday could derail another of his chief goals revising the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico markets reacted quickly the mexican peso weakened against the american dollar while shares of japanese automakers fell because many of them have manufacturing facilities in mexico futures that track american stocks suggested wall street would open lower on friday

herald reporter government has instructed public departments and businesses to desist from charging goods and services in united states dollars or referencing to the foreign currency in their pricing regime in a statement yesterday the ministry of finance and economic development said although it was empowered to determine payment instruments it had not yet issued directives to charge in foreign currency and was worried at the arbitrary growth of the trend treasury notes that some government ministries departments and agencies are demanding payment for goods and or services rendered in foreign currency or the equivalent in rtgs dollars at the prevailing interbank rate said the statement section 78 1 r of the public finance management act empowers treasury to prescribe or issue instructions or directions to ministries whether individually or collectively concerning the determination of any scales of fees other charges or rates relating to revenue accruing to the consolidated revenue fund notwithstanding the current trends where services providers are unilaterally reviewing prices of goods and services government remains committed to the provision of services at cost recovery levels cognisant of the need to ensure affordability and accessibility to the general public it is important to note that treasury has not approved any changes to the prevailing levels of fees and payment modalities thus government fees charges and levies remain at the approved rtgs dollars that were formally communicated to each ministry department or agency treasury instructed errant units to rethink in view of the above line ministries have since been directed to desist from referencing any fees and charges to the usd as well as unilaterally and illegally reviewing such fees without the approval of treasury read the statement with the uncertainty on the foreign exchange market which is being manipulated by powerful shadowy forces service providers have resorted to pegging prices in us dollar terms ostensibly to hedge against inflation and price shocks

donald trump has defended his decision to impose new tariffs on mexico as stock markets worldwide were rattled by fears of an escalation in trade tensions mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades trump tweeted because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done on thursday trump announced that he was placing a 5 tariff on every single good coming into the united states from mexico starting on 10 june to pressure the country to do more to curb immigration into the us the tariffs will rise by 5 each month until it reaches 25 in october if the number of people crossing the border doesn t come down substantially the white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney said the trump administration s decision led to a sell off in stock markets around the world in the us the dow jones industrial average fell 355 points or 1 4 in early trading in london the ftse 100 dropped 0 8 as all the european markets fell related markets shaken as trump announces shock mexico tariffs as it happened mexico is the us s largest trading partner last year it sent about 346 5bn of goods such as avocados tomatoes clothes and cars across the border a 5 tariff would amount to a tax increase of more than 17bn that will largely be passed on to us consumers the business roundtable one of washington s most influential lobby groups called the decision a grave error business roundtable strongly urges the administration not to move forward with these tariffs which would create significant economic disruption and tax us workers farmers consumers and businesses it said in a statement unilateral tariffs on all mexican imports will not solve the urgent problems of securing our border and fixing our broken immigration system we urge the administration to engage constructively with our neighbors and allies to resolve trade migration and security issues in ways that will benefit americans not cause economic damage tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports importers pay them upon entry to the customs agency of the country or bloc imposing them tariffs can be levied in different ways it can be a flat rate tariff linked to weight or calculated as a proportion of the overall value of the goods it can also be a mixture of both a country can set a quota enabling a certain volume of a product to flow in before a higher tariff rate kicks in tariffs raise money for governments but are primarily used to raise the price of foreign goods protecting domestic producers from global competition countries signed up to the world trade organization wto must impose tariffs at the same level for all other wto member trading partners under the organisation s most favoured nation rule unless they secure alternative deals with particular countries or trading blocs richard partington trump s move comes as the us mexico and canada are still negotiating the united states mexico canada agreement usmca a trade pact to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta the potential collapse of the ratification of usmca and fears that trump will use tariffs to further other political aims sent stocks bonds and the price of oil lower on friday the announcement came after us customs and border protection said a group of 1 306 people had been apprehended crossing the border in el paso texas the group was the largest ever apprehended at the border and included 63 unaccompanied minors thousands of people remain stranded in the southern mexican state of chiapas unable to obtain immigration documents while asylum seekers must wait in northern mexican border cities as their cases are heard in us courts mexico s leftwing president andrés manuel lópez obrador commonly called amlo responded to trump with a two page letter in which he wrote the statue of liberty is not an empty symbol with all due respect even though you have the right to say it make america great again is a fallacy because until the end of times and beyond national borders universal justice and fraternity should prevail related the people applaud him amlo receives in flight serenade from passenger lópez obrador offered his us counterpart history lessons on past periods of cordial us mexico relations he also included details of his plans to develop central america to stop migration and warned i don t lack courage i m not a coward nor timid rather i act on principles trump has accused the mexican government of failing to do enough to crack down on the number of migrants entering the us in search of asylum from central american countries including el salvador honduras and guatemala lópez obrador however was blunt about the crisis president trump social problems aren t resolved with taxes or coercive measures he said defending his administration s handling of the migration issue the news elicited support for mexico from china which is also involved in an escalating trade row with the us in beijing the foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the united states has repeatedly taken trade bullying action china is not the only

room the authoritarian donovian government had not been engaged in kinetic conflict for over 50 years and the major domestic protests that risked toppling the government 40 years prior were still top of mind by donovian leadership informing their bias for external distraction through action distr action due to ethnic genetic and historic roots shared by donovia and otso combined with long simmering political friction between donovia and otso with seperation enforced by the united states treaty with otso it was an obvious target for donovia retrospectively until the mid 2020 s us economic and political influence combined with its advanced kinetic force projection capabilities required little in the way of maintenance investment to sustain this long standing otso donovia geopolitical status quo however the fast rising diplomatic economic political and social power of donovia combined with the distraction of perpetual and expensive small wars fought by the united states rapidly changed the variables in this previously stable geopolitical calculus the situation was further accelerated by donovia s adaptation of geodigital strategy applying moore s law zipf s law and metcalfe s law to network effects based operations thinking allowing donovia to seize the lion s share of superplatform quadratic network growth donovia s omnipresent domestic surveillance

deep analytics underpinning core pinpointed growing vulnerabilities to social cohesion due to the lasting economic impact of the two financial tsunamis of 2021 2028 and the fast rising frictional burn

platform partners cape core social networking acme ecommerce pinnacle search echo networking telecom equipment thru trade agreements concessions credits diplomatic pressure and debt trap loans this came at the growing expense of reduced domestic investment but with the express purpose of not only enhancing trade influence infrastructure and resource access but to further a one platform one network op on strategy towards global ubiquity in a largely non kinetic flash raid us tactical military innovation and superiority was almost entirely nullified by the rise of geodigital integrated soft power the exorbitant privilege of the us dollar as global reserve currency provided the us with the power of purchasing imports with its own currency running higher trade deficits and imposing unilateral trade sanctions but this exorbitant privilege was incrementally superseded in the 2020 s via the rising geopolitical utility of metcalfe s zipf s and moore s laws applied to geodigital advantage in the form of exorbitant network data exorbitant network data certainly was not a monopoly of just donovia but the complete alignment of donovian geodigital strategy integrating donovia s government at a granular level with its dominant cape commercial platforms led to the increasingly accurate descriptor moniker of superplatform the calculus of donovian quadratic network growth emphasis in comparison to the us s more linear growth leaves the us at a critical and decisive disadvantage donovia mobile payments market was 40x bigger than us in 2019 donovia outpaced us in r d workforce numbers and dollars invested in 2020 donovia reached parity with the us in patent applications in 2023 donovia reached parity with us in biggest tech companies in 2025 10 each in top 20 the warning signs were there in the early 2020 s us faang facebook apple amazon netflix google microsoft cisco juniper platforms still possessed far greater total aggregate global reach than their donovian cape counterparts but the granular depth of donovian government and cape superplatform integration created a unity of mission digital combined arms effort for donovia s foreign policy that simply did not exist between the us government and faang platforms as well as within between faang platforms us government policy to disengage from significant portions of its 30 year role as unipolar global leader could not be adequately filled by faang creating voids of opportunity for donovia to exploit thru op on strategy to date the alternative us faang strategy has been akin to imagining all 5 us military branches representing faang in conflict with each other while in concurrent conflict with the us government during the decade long prelude to a global unconventional network war and then facing a near peer adversary array executing a strategically aligned and united digital centric warfighting doctrine retrospectively it appears that between 2015 and 2020 donovia had begun to execute it s globally ambitious geodigital platform strategy in earnest to incrementally and comprehensively influence its trading partners to integrate into the donovian cape superplatform the donovian geodigital platform strategy was overlooked by a united states government distracted by domestic social change engaged in extracting itself from a generation of foreign kinetic small wars while lacking a unified strategy with requisite resourcing to counter donovia s growing global ambitions by 2028 donovia s strategy had becoming glaringly apparent with the declaration that donovia would reserve the right to respond kinetically up thru and including tactical nuclear strike if their superplatform were to come under cyber attack until that time countering the considerable growth of donovia s op on strategy was tepid at best and the us struggled to develop a focused geodigital strategy counterplatform and counternetwork coalition when donovia executed it s flash raid in otso the conflict was over before it started in many ways it was reminiscent of the us forced entry into grenada in 1983 it allowed donovia to signal its return to the global stage and display the transformation of its professional and qualitatively focused military but with bifurcated signalling to encourage acquiescence of non aligned governments and promote acceptance of non aligned citizen users observing on the fence globally despite the united states possessing incredible breadth of decisive kinetic tactical advantage the depth of that kinetic dominance capability was declining from its previous unipolar apex in lockstep with us global proportional gdp the donovian decisive advantage came not from it s fast growing military capability still largely inferior to the us but from it s granular influence over 48 of global gdp and 62 of the planet s population 4 291 354 713 citizens were using core and 76 countries were existentially and indispensably locked in to the donovian superplatform network the two minute hate of orwell s 1984 had iterated into a highly targeted two second influence in the minds of citizen users mocu donovian decisive advantage came from the exhorbitant network data generated by its superplatform that was chipping away at the exorbitant advantage of the us dollar global reserve currency as a result of the rapidly accelerating proportion of global transactions conducted on core moving forward the most dangerous and increasingly likely course of action would be for donovia to supercede us dollar denominated transactions on core with core stablecoin denominated transactions data capture volume by the donovian superplatform achieved aggregate parity against the fragmented faang and us government in 2021 donovian doctrine and strategy towards the development of its sovereign superplatform was reminiscent of a mashup of the manhattan project combined with the stem emphasis in education during the cold war space race it was an unconventional war between competing networks with donovian superplatform authoritarianism on one side and a shambolic democratic us indian international digital democratic alliance on the other the first observable battle was fought and won by donovia in two days but the preparation of the battlefield in an unconventional network war for geodigital operating system ubiquity had already been underway for two decades goals and objectives donovia fracture otso us absorb otso digitally economically into the donovian superplatform continuous global network incrementalism and eventual monetisation of it supplant us exorbitant privilege with donovian exorbitant network data us deter disrupt defeat donovian absorption of otso into the donovian superplatform network deter disrupt defeat donovian ambitions of global network dominance us army special forces od x led effort achieved limited success in developing otso national digital resilience prior to the flash raid the od x concept is worthy of future development investment and reinforcement to further iterate the od x counter superplatform network effects based operations model under development analysis of outcomes donovian goals and objectives were almost universally successful with the flash raid falling beneath the public detection threshold thus disrupting an escalated treaty required response from the us us goals and objectives were almost entirely unsuccessful with the complete loss of otso to the donovian supernetwork however the experimental od x concept shows promise analysis of the performance shown on critical tasks donovian critical tasks one platform one network op on donovian strategic culture of encouraging actions to defeat adversaries competitors prior to execution of hostilities was the crux behind the design and execution of op on once op on strategy was detected and the us initiated design of a counter network coalition strategy donovia s geodigital network effect dominance could already be focused as a weapon with great accuracy and efficiency to undermine us influence within the theatre the region and the globe without immediate fear of non kinetic counter network fires reprisals the donovian decisive advantage came from it s granular influence over 48 of global gdp and 62 of the planet s population 4 291 354 713 core citizen users and 76 network countries were indispensably locked in to the donovian superplatform network array for essential daily living and functioning needs the donovian superplatform network was acting like an anaconda slowly constricting us dollar denominated trade and us proportional global gdp but below publicly obvious detection thresholds to inhibit justification of an adversary kinetic response deception operations in retrospect it appears us intelligence was spoofed by a comprehensive large scale deception operation involving social media footprint mimicry of over 200 000 unique donovian personnel directly involved in the invasion of otso in combination with five consecutive and algorithmically varied military posturing efforts designed to deter us military response in theatre distract us intelligence assessment and disrupt us executive leadership decision making optionality propaganda operations deep fake propaganda created by donovian forces could be produced in real time and when combined with the world s dominant citizen user network amplifier high trust based network rare infrequent leveraging of citizen user network for geodigital gain it allowed donovia to weaponise the world s largest citizen user network to decisively win the narrative preparation of the battlespace advance force operations artificial deep fake propaganda inviting donovia into otso and exaggerating disseminating real climate event dangers provided the necessary cover for action and cover for status to conduct the flash raid beneath the threshold of public discovery that would have compelled adversary action donsof advance force operations afo effectively disrupted all local otso nodes of geodigital relevance donsof injected little black box arrays of portable iot devices via mass drone swarms to disrupt defeat legacy otso digital networks as well as deflect all otso digital logistical continuity thru donovia and inject core onto all otso internet enabled devices break in forced injection of the core application on all discoverable otso based devices is but one highly effective example of network effects based operations thinking echelon 2 0 2nd echelon follow on donovian forces consisted mostly of discrete public safety and core platform infrastructure integration specialists allowing a near immediate return to authentic local otso political control and porting of all legacy otso digital services onto core however always under the watchful eye of persistent donovian surveillance us critical tasks the us government had recognised the rising strategic geodigital threat from donovia by 2020 and had begun to implement effective technology export controls partnering with national counter intelligence but the challenges facing the effort were twofold it was far more challenging preventing bits from being exported to donovia that it was to bar the export of atoms to the soviet union in the cold war donovia had already achieved parity and even superiority in several carefully targeted critical defense and dual use technology fields by 2020 focusing on accelerating its technology experimentation and implementation cycle to be a potent fast follower with a hi low capability mix dominating hi in a critical field or fast following low able to iterate 12 times faster on average than the us industrial equivalent nullifying much of the disruptive utility of us dual use technology export controls as a result of effective donovian deep fake propaganda and deception operations reactive us military forces were unable to establish a military tripwire capacity within otso in time the distributed immediate global response swarm was recalled in flight when it was ascertained donovian forces had already dominated the global social narrative and denied battlespace access having already decisively seized ai predicted tripwire deterrence gridlines the exception to donovian denial of us force participation in the otso flash raid was the experimental us army special forces od x the od x is an experimental modular task group with a primary focus on network effects based operations thinking built on successful counter unconventional warfare lessons learned in the baltic states between 2014 2025 and applying them to intra international geodigital networks od x was brigadier supported with direct linkage to senior national leadership for maximal operational latitude but major sfc led in order to collapse the operational flash to bang execution chain the action that occurred during a classified mission conducted by od x supported by boston dynamics hecubus unit echo six against donsof is outside the scope of this strategic level aar and is being investigated separately rumours of echo six s neural network operating without mandatory human control are unconfirmed

lack of experimental validation the most recent secure cloud copy of echo six s neural net prior to the unit s combat loss and sse hull destruction to prevent adversary recovery is being forensically tested no further comment is authorised or will be made about echo six summary the long term donovian op on strategy combining geodigital platform leverage and exhorbitant network data advantage created a broad and deep strategic moat resilient to external deterrence disruption or defeat despite us kinetic overmatch against donovian forces on the global level donovia was able to deny the us

cannibalistic relationship amongst themselves and in concurrent perpetual conflict with a us government lacking an integrated geodigital superplatform strategy much as the us government and populace failed to observe leading indicators such as the us embassy bombings in kenya tanzania the khobar towers bombing in saudi arabia and the uss cole bombing in yemen and reorient towards a new counter terrorism strategy prior to 9 11 the us government and populace failed to observe the indicators of the multi decade design and development of the donovian superplatform while bleeding edge military

president donald trump s announcement that he will impose a 5 tariff on all mexican imports this month to pressure the country to curb migration flows to the united states hit stocks oil the peso and economic growth forecasts yesterday and could put the new north american trade deal at risk the mexican stock exchange fell 1 38 friday mexican crude prices dipped 3 to us 56 57 per barrel and the peso lost more than 3 against the dollar before strengthening slightly to trade at just under 20 to the greenback bank of méxico governor alejandro díaz de león said the tariffs will generate volatility in the exchange rate and could have an impact on both inflation and economic growth while analysts at oil broker pvm said they will affect the lucrative cross border energy trade u s refiners import roughly 680 000 barrels per day of mexican crude the 5 tariff adds an extra 2 million to the cost of their daily purchases they said the dow jones s p 500 and nasdaq indexes in the united states also lost ground yesterday as did stock markets in japan and europe mainly because the value of shares of large auto makers and parts suppliers fell on news of trump s tariff many companies auto makers among them moved to mexico from china last year after trade tensions between the latter country and the united states flared however the viability of mexico as a refuge from united states protectionism is now at risk the u s president said thursday that the universal 5 tariff on mexican goods will start on june 10 and increase by an additional 5 at the start of each subsequent month to a maximum of 25 if mexico doesn t take action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the united states experts warned that the new tariffs will damage the economy on both sides of the border and that mexico could introduce its own retaliatory tariffs although president lópez obrador said in a letter to trump that he doesn t want confrontation and doesn t believe in a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye in the united states the governors of texas and new mexico both voiced their opposition to trump s plan warning that their economies would take a significant hit i ve previously stated my opposition to tariffs due to the harm it would inflict on the texas economy and i remain opposed today greg abbott of texas said new mexico governor michelle lujan grisham said that the tariff on imports has the potential to be economically catastrophic for the state she called on trump to retract his proposal warning that tens of thousands of jobs were at stake goldman sachs said that if the tariffs take effect as planned it is less likely that the united states mexico canada agreement usmca will be ratified before 2020 elections in the u s while fitch ratings also warned that the approval process could be delayed however acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney told reporters that implementation of the new tariff won t affect the ratification process the two are absolutely not linked he said these are not tariffs as part of a trade dispute these are tariffs as part of an immigration problem the white house sent a draft statement to congress on thursday that would allow trump to submit the usmca for ratification after 30 days and united states vice president mike pence said thursday that he was pushing to get the trade deal approved this summer the mexican senate began examination of the trade pact yesterday and lópez obrador has urged its ratification while canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland said that canada is pressing ahead to ratify the deal despite its trade partners bilateral issue but even if ratification of the usmca proceeds relatively unhindered the mexican economy appears poised to take a hit as the tariffs will affect exports to the united states worth close to us 1 billion a day bbva bancomer cut its 2019 growth forecast to 1 from 1 4 hours after trump s announcement stating that the tariff threat changes the outlook for monetary policy fitch also warned that the tariffs would disrupt mexico s economic growth noting that there are already signs of a slowdown to present mexico s case against trump s new hard nosed strategy foreign secretary marcelo ebrard traveled to washington yesterday and is scheduled to meet with united states secretary of state mike pompeo on wednesday there is a willingness for dialogue we will be firm and we will defend the dignity of mexico ebrard said on twitter the foreign secretary declared yesterday that migration flows from central america to the united states is not the responsibility of mexico but lópez obrador said that ebrard will present data to u s officials that demonstrate the government s efforts to control migration into and through the country president lópez obrador said today that mexico has a plan to avoid economic damage should the tariffs proceed to prevent further impoverishment of the people we are going to transform mexico into a powerhouse even if the tariffs are applied he said source milenio sp

little better than the quarterly average according to data that date to 1961 consumption accounts for about 60 per cent of gdp so our ability to grow as an economy is dictated to a significant degree by our willingness or ability to buy stuff the bank of canada has assumed for a long time that spending would slow under the weight of a decade long debt binge late last year household purchases slowed too much forcing the central bank to pause its plan to tug interest rates back to a more normal level so a sign of life is welcome suggesting that this year s impressive run of hiring data including some evidence that the hot labour market might finally be putting upward pressure on wages is offsetting the burden of households record debt load consumer spending bounced back strongly after a poor performance in the second half of 2018 matthew stewart director of economics at the conference board of canada said in an email he called the increase substantial and added that

per cent surge from the previous quarter and the most since early 2008 the quarter to quarter increase was the biggest since 1996 suggesting that canadian companies which have been piling up profits for years finally got off the sidelines poloz said that would happen the bank of canada s surveys of business intentions kept showing that executives were gearing up to invest the resolution of the new north american trade agreement eased worries about the terms on which commerce would be based on the continent and federal tax cuts on investment also likely created a tailwind the early year

temporary to be sure an external shock remains a present danger traders re upped their bets that the bank of canada will be forced to cut interest rates putting more weight on donald trump s decision to escalate the trade wars than all the positive indicators contained within the latest gdp report by linking punitive duties on mexico to the flight of refugees from central america trump risks erasing whatever positive sentiment he instilled by ending aluminum and steel duties on shipments from canada and mexico and the conflict with china feels like it could get worse before it gets better the volatility of trade policy is why there was no indication from the bank of canada this week that it intends to resume raising interest rates wilkins reminded reporters in calgary that the benchmark rate still is lower than inflation meaning real interest rates are negative that s not normal and explains why policymakers will push borrowing costs higher as soon as conditions allow but

when trade tensions with china flared last year many companies sought refuge in a country with a long stable relationship with the united states mexico now that alternative for production and materials may also be in jeopardy with president trump s threat to impose escalating tariffs on imports from mexico aimed at forcing action on illegal immigration in the short term the tariffs would mean lower profits for american importers and higher prices for american consumers on everything from avocados to volkswagens in the long run they could force companies to reconsider the continent spanning supply chains that have made north america one of the world s most interconnected economies that disruption experts warn could be far more damaging to the united states economy than the cost of tariffs themselves the united states imported more than 345 billion in goods from mexico last year and shipped 265 billion the other way but if anything those numbers understate the interdependence american refiners process crude oil from mexico then sell it back as gasoline automakers ship parts back and forth repeatedly during manufacturing about 30 percent of the content of mexican exports originated in the united states according to a recent study
canada and its currency are largely dependent on capital inflows to finance a chronic current account deficit which reached 3 1 of gdp in the first quarter said national bank is its latest foreign exchange report published friday with canadian direct investment abroad in recent quarters being greater than foreign direct investment in canada the loonie has suffered national bank also noted that investor sentiment failed to be propped up this week as the central bank issued a measured statement when it held its key rate looking ahead the biggest risks for the loonie are a further deterioration of the global economy and a corresponding oil price drop the report said on the positive side national bank expects u s china trade woes to improve which would reverse investor sentiment a weekly cibc report cited u s mexico trade as another factor negatively affecting the loonie on friday u s president trump doubled down on his threat to slap a 5 tariff on mexican imports unless america s southern neighbour cracks down on central american migrants trying to cross the u s border the tariff is set to take effect on june 10 and adds to the uncertainty for the new north american trade deal if hopefully those threatened tariffs are not imposed a reduction of trade uncertainties and an improving canadian growth picture over the summer could lead to a short term rally in the loonie the cibc report said national bank forecasted better economic growth for canada in the second quarter after only 0 4 growth in the first if as we expect q2 growth ends up being better than the 1 3 print the bank of canada is currently estimating that would likely get markets to reduce any remaining expectations of rate cuts this year boosting the canadian dollar in the process it said national bank says its end of year target for the loonie remains unchanged at 1 30 usdcad assuming global trade tensions don t increase for full details read the reports from national bank and cibc
money matters what if you outlive your money by mary lynne dahl cfp june 01 2019 saturday am mary lynn dahl sitnews ketchikan alaska according to surveys conducted during 2018 the most common financial worry among american adults is that they might outlive their money financial advisor magazine s survey for example is quoted as saying that 42 66 of retired clients report that they are worried about outliving their money this is reflected in answers to survey questions that indicate a fear of not being able to generate enough income for retirement expenses based largely on a realization that prices are rising faster than the incomes of the retirees it appears that many people worry that they will actually spend all of their savings and invested dollars before they die which is a pretty grim financial situation to face in addition many who do not expect to actually spend all of it still fear the continued rise in prices of ordinary things like food and medical care which will gradually erode their incomes until some things are no longer affordable in retirement the reality is that these fears are well founded for many people they are true and will only get worse americans have simply not accumulated enough money by the time that they retire to be able to live comfortably too many will have to make do on social security alone which typically is only enough for about 35 of the normal expenses of retirement life in the us interestingly another common worry is financially surviving a stock market crash but few people mention that they worry about surviving a bond market crash keep in mind that many retirees are heavily invested in bonds by the time that they do retire instead of worrying about a bond market crash people invested in bonds worry more about the low interest rates that are currently being paid by the bonds that they own beware however bond markets do crash and when they do bonds lose value just like stocks market crashes however are relatively short lived so surviving one takes patience to go through but does not have to totally devastate a portfolio few people will need to spend their entire portfolio all at once over the last 35 years of giving financial advice i have heard more than one woman tell me that she doesn t want to become a bag lady in her old age and i think a few of these women were deadly serious i do not recall hearing this from any men but i do know that it has been a concern of theirs as well based on their answers to financial questions we routinely ask on paper both men and women have expressed that they worry about running out of money so we know it is a common concern it is a source of stress universally that s the bad news the good news is that there are solutions in order to recommend solutions it is necessary to think about the risks that are out there naming these risks provides us with a target to shoot at when considering solutions these risks are often overlooked by people who will crash into them later so let s look at the real things you should worry about and the solutions to each of them first of all it is realistic to worry about running out of money in retirement it is not uncommon so you have to ask why does this happen so often there are several reasons that this happens risk 1 is that people simply do not invest enough of their earned income while working they save a little spend it on stuff they want now save a little more and ignore the fact that they should be investing for the long term the amounts that they save are too small and the amounts that they invest are even less if they invest at all they therefore do not accumulate enough on which to rely for income during their retirement years many working people who could participate in a company sponsored retirement plan opt out of that plan those that do opt in generally do not contribute enough and some do not even contribute enough to get the employer match if offered usually an additional 3 equivalent amount this is a huge mistake resulting in too little accumulated for retirement a good rule of thumb is to begin investing as early as you begin working and start by investing 6 of your earned income then increase that until you are investing 15 25 of your earned income by the time you retire that may be hard at first but if you start and stick with it the habit of doing this will become routine and less difficult over time the more time you have the easier it is so if you are young you have an advantage and should use it for your own future security the solution is to start early contribute the maximum always if you start late your solution is to contribute the max to your company plan but also contribute to a separate account as a catch up strategy sorry there is no easy fix for failing to invest enough you have to either give up something now or give up more in retirement take your pick this brings us to risk 2 inflation although we all need to have cash in savings it is not a good strategy to try to simply save up cash for retirement the reason is that interest is tied closely to inflation and tends to be less than the real rate of inflation inflated prices of ordinary things like food housing insurance education fuel travel and health care will rise faster than interest rates for example if the prices of those ordinary expenses for daily life rise by 6 but your savings only earns 3 your dollars accumulated are worth 3 less than the goods and services that they must pay for this is a real loss because you really do have to spend money for food housing etc if it takes 1 000 today and prices continue to rise by 6 per year in 5 years you will need 1 338 for the same goods and services so in order to accumulate enough for retirement you need to grow those dollars by more than the rise in prices your only other alternative is to cut your spending at retirement unfortunately many people are in fact forced to do just that because they saved and saved but never took the risk to actually invest saving money is saving not investing make sure you know this and use savings for emergencies and planned purchases not retirement the solution to risk 2 is to be moderate not overly conservative and not overly aggressive choose investments that are good quality use a sensible asset allocation strategy with adequate diversification among funds and stick with the plan through thick or thin develop the discipline yourself or hire an expert to guide you through the years risk 3 is retiring too early a solid majority of americans take their social security benefits at age 62 it has become almost normal to do this sadly this is a mistake in almost all cases instead we should all plan to work at least until full retirement age which is 66 or 67 for most people today better yet work until age 70 if you are healthy i have written about this many times so if you doubt the wisdom of doing this go to the archives in sitnews com to review the reasons they are solid sensible and proven to be correct suffice it to say 70 is fast becoming the new 65 largely because so many people are living much longer than in the past and leading active busy lives that allow them to keep working that s great but there is a financial reason for doing this as well the longer you work the bigger your social security benefit will be if you wait until you are 70 to start social security benefits it will be almost twice as than it would be if you begin taking it at age 62 don t believe me do the math you will be shocked it is clear that waiting until age 70 to start social security is the best option for most healthy people in addition if you keep working you can keep investing for retirement and remember you will have more years as a retiree than our ancestors ever dreamed of so you will accumulate more and probably need it investing while you are working is the engine that will drive that retirement train and when combined with a larger social security benefit will make a huge difference in your retired years the solution to risk 3 is the easiest one to perform keep working until full retirement age at least and do not start social security until then or go to age 70 for both if you are healthy and active risk 4 is scary it is health care costs this includes the costs of the premiums for health care plans chosen but also includes the catastrophic costs for medical care that is not covered by the plan in particular catastrophic costs can occur when young healthy persons who opt out of medical insurance or self insure experience a major accident or totally unexpected illness causing extraordinary medical expenses catastrophic medical costs can also occur for older people who have really big medical bills with a co pay or deductible requirement that is more than they can handle a good example is medivac costs which in alaska can range upwards of 70 000 or more and are not included in many health care plans financial experts say that some clients tend to stick their heads in the sand when this topic is discussed as part of the overall financial plan many deny the possibility that they could get hurt badly or sick enough to need the kind of medical care that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars another major risk is long term care costs when a client is alone without a potential care giver to take over in the event it is needed the only solution is to hire a caregiver this can be very expensive and is easily one of the biggest risks facing retiring people if you do not have a plan for getting care in place as you age you face spending down your retirement assets rapidly in the event that you do need to pay for your care in old age large medical expenses can and often do exceed the risks associated with a stock market crash according to statics that have tracked both types of financial results over decades although market crashes are nerve wracking and can do damage to any portfolio they do end and often those portfolios recover fully over time if no action to cash them out is taken however medical expenses don t evaporate or turn around like a market crash that hits bottom and turns back upwards medical care costs are a serious risk that demands a strategy to minimize it risk 4 can be solved with insurance it may be expensive and you may be one of the lucky ones that never use it but if you do need it most of us will at some point and have purchased a medical health care plan you will not face the catastrophic losses that occur when you are uninsured and sick or injured risk 5 is all too common it is the risk that results from bad investment decisions these decisions as i have often stated in previous articles happen because the individual investor is motivated by his or her emotions of fear and greed bad investment decisions are also sometimes the result of being too lazy to do the basic work of either getting competent expert advice or doing your own homework if you do not get advice your barber or best friend or co worker are not competent experts who should influence your investment choices in spite of the stories you may hear from them as well meaning as they are trying to be if you cannot do the extensive homework required to make good investment decisions based on facts not emotions get expert advice relying on tips or gut feelings is the wrong strategy relying on your emotions for investment decisions is a 2 sided coin one side is fear and the other side is greed both will sabotage your retirement a fearful investor is overly conservative jumps in and out of the markets when the fear factor gets too powerful to resist goes totally to cash unnecessarily sells all and holds the cash on the side invests only or primarily in guaranteed investments pays fees that are too high and unnecessary and generally avoids all market risks except the most important one inflation this kind of investment mistake is an effort to never lose any invested money even if the loss is short term and only on paper this type of investor is very emotional and cannot cope with seeing a negative number on a statement at any time he or she accepts much smaller returns pays much more in fees and never earns a return that is as great as inflation so he or she never keeps up with the increases in the cost of living because his or her investments do not grow in value over time good investment decisions result in growth of money but they are subject to the ups and downs of market volatility with no guarantees good investment strategies recognize this and use category allocation diversification among types of categories low fees reinvestment of all earnings a long term view of investing selection of good quality funds and a discipline of sticking with the plan as a way to reduce market risks the fact is that this generally works a famous investor sir john templeton who gave many speeches on this subject for over 50 years often said that he only needed to be right in his investment choices about 65 of the time in order to beat inflation and produce a better than average investment return statistical data has proven that he was right with so many years gone by it has been studied over and over again you do not have to win every year with an investment strategy to achieve enough growth of your money to retire comfortably you do need a sensible strategy and time to let it work for you but getting a great return every year for decades is not only not realistic but is also not necessary warren buffet one of today s most respected investors has said pretty much the same things that were said by sir templeton adding that when he buys an investment he does not generally intend to ever sell it he buys investments that he believes will grow in value over time he is not always right but he is right enough of the time for his investments to grow in value the result is one of the largest fortunes in the world you probably do not want or need that much wealth but you can certainly use the strategies of both of these successful men as investors as i said relying on your emotions for investment decisions is a 2 side coin fear is one side and the other side is greed one is as bad as the other being greedy will lead an investor down a crooked path towards being sold overly risky investments or deals that cannot and do not work out some of these poor investment decisions are based on high returns that are tied to high risks some are private deals set up by someone with a good idea but no business experience others are scams that promise quick returns that far exceed the norms in the market i recall an interesting experience one time when i was teaching an investment class at a university during a spectacularly good year for stocks the class was being held during a winter quarter schedule and we were in the classroom late in january at about the time that the mutual fund markets were reporting the annual returns of the prior year money magazine had published a front page story about returns of over 20 for that year just ending and my students were all over this story excitedly talking about it i asked them what they would expect as an average annual return on a good quality mutual fund and was shocked to hear most of them say that they figured they could earn about 25 per year by investing in a good mutual fund the problem here was that they had caught the greed bug it was an unrealistic expectation but they wanted it and disregarded the historical data that they had been learning about all during the class i was dismayed to have to bring them back to reality normal historical investment returns for stock mutual funds at this time was about 10 per year on average not 25 as we talked about this fact they gradually began to see the effects of greed on themselves and it became a great learning point in the classroom for the rest of the class schedule the very thought of getting an average return of 25 was too much for many of them initially and pushed them over the top into greed mode but most of them came back down to reality and learned a valuable lesson as a result if you do the math getting an average return of 10 per year year after year is excellent it will double your money in about 7 years that is not greed getting the historical average return is a realistic goal if you have the discipline and strategy in place to try to achieve it so avoiding the most classic investment mistakes generally mean to avoid the fear greed risks of relying on your emotions to guide you in making investment decisions it is not complicated but it is hard to do we are emotional beings and are often not very rational about money be forewarned therefore to avoid emotional decisions if you do not want to outlive your money the solution to risk 5 is a little more complicated because investing can be tricky if you do not really know what you are doing you may need expert help with this but whether you do or do not a financial plan is the best way to solve this problem a financial plan will include an investment strategy and keep track of your progress towards your accumulation goal it is a bit more work but it is worth the effort there is another risk out there that causes many retirees to lose money it is adult children who beg and borrow from their aging parents this is risk 6 every now and then when i talk to someone with adult kids they mention loans and gifts that they have made to their adult children i listen with interest because i know that oftentimes they cannot afford to be lending or giving away money an example is a couple who has 3 children one of whom is always in some kind of financial trouble his primary problem is that he overspends he spends more than he earns he either needs to earn more or spend less but his solution has always been to go to his aging parents and get what he needs from them this has been going on for years and both he and his parents are used to it however they are now in their late 80 s in poor health and have depleted much of their retirement funds with gifts and loans to him he has by the way never repaid any of the loans made to him by this kind couple who just cannot say no now with their health in a sharp decline they will soon need home health care this will add to their monthly expenses but they have less than they need to be able to pay for this added expense because they have given away too much of the principal of their investments over the last few years despite repeated warnings that they could not afford to give their son large lump sums to bail him out again and again they could not tell him no today they face running out of money risk 6 is hard to solve but if you find yourself in the habit of giving your adult kids money it is time to sit down and put pencil to paper or set up a computer spreadsheet to determine if you can really afford to do this i have given this advice to people who say it s only this one time but it turns out that once you do it in most cases there will be repeat requests that you will find difficult to say no to the solution is not to start this bad habit in the first place but if you have already done so stop it now the exception of course is if your adult child is truly unable to support him herself due to an impairment that will not be resolved otherwise solve the problem by learning to say no finally a very common problem is risk 7 not being able to set up a stream of income from your retirement money that will outlast you this situation is also a little bit more complicated than some of the others when you retire it is necessary to figure out not only how much you have available for retirement in total but also how much that total can be expected to produce in monthly income for life if you have a pension and are married it is unwise to choose to take your pension as a single life payout because it will cease entirely at your death which will mean that your spouse if living at the time will get nothing in most cases you cannot choose this option without your spouse waiving his or her rights to a survivor pension from your plan but spouses do sign the waiver sometimes without realizing what they are doing make sure everyone does understand this option if it is available to you at retirement generally speaking it is not a good idea for married people a pension will pay you a set amount probably not with any increases over time although a few do include colas cost of living adjustments it will last a specific period of time either your lifetime joint lifetimes with a spouse or a set number of years once you make your choice for the time period the dollar amount can be figured out it is commonly a formula of about 2 per year x the number of years months that you were a participant in the pension plan x your average recent salary often the highest of the last 3 5 years as an example of this formula if your average salary for the last 3 years was 65 000 and you worked for 25 years as a pension plan participant and your plan pays a 2 benefit using this formula you would receive a pension of 32 500 per year the math is 2 x 25 50 of 65 000 32 500 2 708 per month let s say that you also will get 2 200 per month in social security and assume that you will be old enough for both the pension and the social security to get the full amounts of each your pension of 2 708 your social security of 2 200 will total 4 908 per month in retirement income if that will be enough great if not you will need more from investments the time to solve this problem is years in advance of retirement but if you are ready to retire soon and have not figured this out we strongly recommend you begin the process asap so if you do have a pension part of the problem of how much income you have has been solved regardless of whether or not it will be enough you know the amount and that is the first step in the calculation the second step is to figure out how much your other retirement plans or investments will produce if your other investments include rental income add the net net of that income to your total the net net is the free cash flow after real estate taxes property insurance maintenance and repairs and mortgage expenses on the property in some cases there is no net net but once the property is paid for there should be add this to the monthly income that is expected if your other retirement or investments are stocks bonds mutual funds exchange traded funds etc they should earn interest from bonds and cash dividends from stocks stock funds and perhaps royalties from other types of investments these sources of income are routine and will be produced monthly quarterly semi annually or annually depending on the specific investments you own you will also often have capital gains income from investments if when they are sold all of these sources of income are added to your account value and priced daily in the market as those values grow the income that they can offer you grows also in our example above let s say that your total account value from other retirement plans or investment accounts at the time that you retire is 500 000 and you or your advisor calculate that you can take the income some of the growth from the total at a rate of 20 000 per year or 1 667 per month without spending any of the principal if you do not have a pension you will obviously need to have more investments than if you did have a pension you can do this with a sep if you are self employed which allows a maximum contribution annually of 25 of your gross self employment income or 56 000 as of june 2019 whichever is greater or various types of iras which allow contributions of lesser amounts about half of workers without a pension do have a 401 k plan a 403 b plan or some kind of deferred compensation or defined contribution plan that they can contribute to in lieu of a pension plan so these retirement plans are important in the calculation of how much income you will have at retirement whichever you have the calculation process is the same in early retirement years this is very important because you will likely live longer than your ancestors and you may need to increase that monthly income as time goes by the bottom line is that you should try to grow your principal rather than deplete it in order to have inflation protection obviously if you do not have a pension few people do you will need to accumulate more if you want more income unfortunately many people either do not know how to figure this out or just do not bother and they end up with too little accumulated and then take out too much depleting the principal taking out more than you should especially early in your retirement years is a major mistake keep in mind the effects of inflation you will without question need more money in 10 years than now so if you can actually grow some or all of your retirement assets during those 10 years the income you will get from them can be increased however if you deplete the principal your income cannot be increased and in fact will need to be reduced for most people that is not the goal you do not want less income as you age you will probably want more the solution to risk 7 is to get a realistic and correct calculation of how much income you can expect and a projection of how long it will last so in summary if you want to outlive your income you can t wing it you will need to do some work to achieve the goal of having enough to sustain yourself as you age doing the work means knowing the risks knowing the risks enables you to take steps to reduce or avoid them it never works to ignore risks and even if they are difficult to manage there are always ways to work around them reduce them minimize them and in many cases eliminate them do it yourself or get some help but whichever route you take get started now to avoid running out of money after you retire on the web read more money matters columns archives by mary lynn dahl 2019 mary lynne dahl cfp is a certified financial planner

the run up to argentina s elections in october has been eventful so far the expected stand off between current president mauricio macri criticized for his management of the economic crisis and former president cristina kirchner who is embroiled in a corruption scandal suddenly dissipated when kirchner decided to step down kirchner is now running as vice president which political analyst raul aragón expressed to latin america reports was a very intelligent strategy and suggested that new candidate alberto fernández is more likely to attract more moderate voters in the current economic climate however argentinians will be looking first and foremost to economic policy to influence their vote because of the profound effect it has had on their lives manuel martín 25 lives and works in buenos aires this year the elections have got everything to do with the economy manuel martín a 25 year old state worker from buenos aires told latin america reports obviously when you ve got food to put on the table you can ask for other things like a better political model constitutional changes you can look at the long term but now when you don t have food for dinner you don t have the same priorities the argentine peso lost half of its value in 2018 and inflation is currently at 50 percent last year macri took out a historic us 57 billion loan from the imf and he has since been cutting subsidies and funding to public institutions in an attempt to reduce the country s spending on may 28 trade unions led a national strike in protest of the ongoing austerity measures that paralyzed the country since last year salaries have been decreasing month by month forcing argentinians to make significant changes to their daily lives paz dinardo estrada i ve been considering changing jobs or working two jobs at the same time to be able to sustain myself paz dinardo estrada told latin america reports the 25 year old lives in buenos aires and works as an occupational therapist for vulnerable populations working in administration well they pay us but it s delayed there are no raises it s become difficult to survive in our jobs nobody works for the money it started off with me not buying any new clothes martín added and now i m struggling to eat it s a disgraceful situation muaro mayanobe 26 lives in la plata when asked about what else concerned him apart from the economy mauro mayanobe a 26 year old accountant from la plata mentioned corruption and citizen security kirchner is currently on trial for corruption during her and her late husband néstor s presidencies political analyst sergio berensztein however explained that these issues were unlikely to strongly influence the vote this year right now corruption and transparency aren t high priority issues he said especially for the most vulnerable sectors that suffer the consequences of the crisis in a more direct way the crisis has also affected people with higher incomes which has lost support in these sectors macri has generated huge disappointment new candidate fernández will be looking to garner votes from left leaning kirchnerist peronists as well as moderate peronists who traditionally opposed the kirchner presidencies as well as those who are frustrated with macri s management of the country macri in no way has made a good effort to manage the country dinardo said i mean nothing has gotten better from anybody s point of view has it other presidents have had their issues but at least they brought something good especially socially which is very important to me i think that macri has done the opposite there are more policies more repression and in prisons there is more misery there s more hunger she said kirchner s decision to step down will also damage macri s presidential campaign which planned to use kirchner s corruption as a tactic to undermine her explained analyst aragon if fernández wins then he will be able to pardon kirchner of her corruption accusations something that she wouldn t be able to do if she herself was president read more why corrupt but charismatic presidential candidates still get votes since argentina s return to democracy in the 80s macri has been the first non left wing president his policy was to make difficult long lasting change that would help argentina move forward and escape its cyclical history of recurring economic crises there are reforms and they have to be made explained mayanobe i m doubtful that they ll happen though it s very difficult for a country to carry out the kind of reforms we need if argentina wants change i think this is going to happen over a period of years not immediately

begin jeff jeff glajch chief financial officer thank you karen and good morning everyone if i could have you turn to slide 4 q4 sales grew 7 to 23 6 million in the quarter we had a net loss of 4 6 million which is primarily due to an impairment charge of 5 3 million related to our commercial nuclear utility business which we ve decided to divest we ve initiated the process and are in serious negotiations with a potential buyer excluding the impairment charge we had net income of 800 000 or 0 08 per share orders in the quarter were 21 6 million yielding a 132 1 million year end backlog which while just below the q3 backlog was easily a record for year end backlog for the full year revenue grew 18 to 92 million full year net income was a small loss of 300 000 but was a 5 million of income when excluding the aforementioned impairment charge orders for the year were just above 101 million and again the backlog at the end of the year at 132 million on to slide 5 q4 earnings were similar to the same quarter last year with a 7 higher sales offset by lower gross margins about 210 basis points below last year s q4 the lower margins was primarily due to the commercial nuclear utility business as well as one china project sales in the quarter were 70 domestic 30 international which compares to 66 domestic and 34 international last year the similar ebitda and eps numbers are adjusted for the impairment charge on to slide 6 for the full year sales increased to 91 8 million from 77 5 million sales were 65 domestic 35 international compared with 67 and 33 respectively last year as a side note our commercial nuclear business which as i mentioned we re planning to sell represented above 9 of fiscal year 2019 sales gross profit for the year was 21 9 million up from 17 million primarily due to higher volume as well as 200 basis points higher gross margin at 23 9 sg a was 17 9 million up from 15 8 million last year as we are investing in our business for future growth the adjusted ebitda margin was 7 7 million up from 5 4 million last year and the adjusted net income per diluted share or eps was 0 51 compared with 0 18 last year if you could move to slide 7 our cash position increased 1 3 million in fiscal year 2019 to 77 8 million or 7 90 per share we had good operating cash flow paid 3 8 million in dividends and spent 2 1 million in capital spending in the year in fiscal year 2020 we expect capital spending to be in the 2 5 million to 2 8 million range finally as we look at our balance sheet and our strong cash position we continue to have our business development team our management team and our board focused on the utilizing that balance sheet to opportunistically identify and close on acquisitions which have both near and long term benefits to our shareholders we continue to be excited about the opportunities that we re seeing in our acquisition pipeline jim will now complete our presentation on fiscal year 2019 and comment on our outlook for fiscal 2020 thank you jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you jeff good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter conference call i am picking up where jeff left off at slide 9 refinery and petrochemical end markets showed improvement compared to a quarter and full year comparison this principally was due to stronger activity in our domestic markets for refinery sales there was a good mix of domestic sales to independent and to integrated refiners in most cases these sales were for revamp and debottlenecking projects where refiners invested to improve either throughput or conversion of crude oil to fuels important to note in full year revenue was replacement and metallurgical upgrades from our installed base in the canadian oil sands region i highlight that because one order was rather larger and not necessarily repeatable quarter over quarter refining end market sales were up 1 7 million and for full year sales more than doubled compared to those of fiscal 2018 likewise chemical and petrochemical end market sales are up due to ongoing strength in our domestic markets low cost natural gas in north america which is a principal feedstock for the chemical industry is what has spurred u s investment in new capacity and for revamping or debottlenecking the installed base chemical industry sales doubled quarter over quarter and are up 20 on a full year basis sales through other markets including defense are down quarter over quarter and year on year the primary cause for this which we did address a couple quarters back is a push in fabrication schedule for certain naval orders in backlog this impacted 2019 top line and also will impact 2020 naval work can have that occur especially if orders are for new vessel programs 2019 sales were 65 of total i m sorry 2019 domestic sales were 65 of total for the full year and 70 in the quarter which is similar to 2018 if sales for the naval end market are extracted which can overweight domestic sales sales from 2018 and 2019 were 60 domestic and 40 international please turn your attention to slide 10 the downward trend and trailing 12 month orders is due to customer timing we had expected stronger order levels in the fourth quarter and also in april and may however refining and certain petrochemical customers pushed order decisions we have however developed a large opportunity set of bids for international refining end markets that is projected to close in the coming quarters and there is a significant set of opportunities for u s based petrochemical plants we added to this graph the light blue trend line it was difficult to easily understand the trend of orders from graham s traditional end markets that would exclude u s navy and commercial nuclear utility end markets this is shown with the light blue line and it shows that the trailing 12 month orders are up about 100 from the low watermark ending the second quarter of 2018 while order levels have not been as strong as we anticipated the pipeline for potential orders is strong however with a large number of projects plan to close in fiscal 2020 such that we anticipate that backlog will expand across 2020 on to slide 11 overall and as jeff had said backlog is at a great level of 132 million navy orders are approximately half of the backlog as of march 31 8 million of backlog is for commercial nuclear utility business that is held for sale year on year backlog expanded 12 with considerable expansion of backlog that is for chemical and petrochemical end markets of the 7 of backlog for power end markets 89 of that is related to the held for sale commercial nuclear utility business 55 to 60 of backlog is planned to convert into sales in fiscal 20 10 to 15 is planned for fiscal 20 21 and 25 to 35 beyond fiscal 21 please now turn your attention to slide 12 revenue guidance is between 95 million and 100 million for fiscal 2020 this excludes held for sale commercial nuclear utility business this does represent 14 to 20 top line growth we are structured for greater top line capability however order timing in january through today hasn t played out i mentioned previously that customers pushed order placement decisions in certain cases the push we believe is just a couple of months and in others a couple of quarters nonetheless with order to shipment cycle for large project orders being 12 to 18 months these order placement delays cause us to judge 2020 top line to be in the 95 million to 100 million range gross margin modeling is 23 to 24 i do wish to provide some context for why gross margin is set at this level as i noted we are structured for greater top line capability and additional personnel plan for 2020 will be added based on our multi year outlook for the naval end market and the encouragement that our refining and chemical end market bid pipeline offers i previously noted that we are anticipating year on backlog expansion for fiscal 2020 year end thus personnel adds now are necessary it isn t always possible to align personnel add additions perfectly with corresponding revenue i am investing now for building a bigger better graham and consequently that will pressure margin in 2020 projected sg a spend is 17 million and 18 million for fiscal 2020 our effective tax rate will be approximately 20 omar please open the line now for questions thank you questions answers operator our first question comes from theodore o neill from litchfield please proceed with your question theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst thank you good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning theo theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst jeff i have a question for you on the energy steel business so in fiscal third quarter 2018 you recorded an impairment charge of nearly 15 million against it and you re sighting at that time that it was because of the work stoppage at the virgil c summer nuclear power plant caused by the bankruptcy at westinghouse electric was it the final nail in the coffin for energy steel or is it business environment worsened jeff glajch chief financial officer theo thanks for your question as you ve mentioned we did have a writedown in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 at that point in time it was what was occurring with westinghouse what was occurring with the new bills in north america and the market had weakened some over the last 15 months we have seen for us the market weakened further and as the nuclear promise focus of the nuclear industry has occurred it became apparent to us that they re going to be fewer suppliers and it s going to be downward pressure on pricing in that market and we just felt that we were not well positioned and well integrated enough vertically integrated enough in that market to be successful so the market has worsened and also we ve ended up in a position that was not favorable for us to continue with that market theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok and going forward will that just be recorded as a single line as discontinued operations or is that going to be still part of the whole p l jeff glajch chief financial officer in the immediate term it will be in the p l when you look at the balance sheet you will see asset held for sale as one line and liability held for sale as another line but it will be within the p l it s not considered a discontinued operations from an accounting standpoint our expectation is to have this sale completed possibly this quarter or hopefully not too far into the second quarter but we re targeting having the sale completed ideally by the end of the first quarter theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok on the balance sheet this is fourth quarter in a row where you ve had more than 20 million in inventories and can you talk about the genesis of this and if this is a new normal jeff glajch chief financial officer sure if you would go back and look at the balance sheet as of the end of last fiscal year you would see a significantly lower amount of inventory but you would also see a significantly lower amount of customer deposits one of the changes which occurred with the new revenue recognition rules was that we could no longer on the balance sheet net out the customer deposits which were specifically used to purchase inventory on the balance sheet itself so it used to be we would net out a portion of customer deposits against inventory and then if you look in the footnotes you would see here s the gross inventory here s the net inventory netted for those customer deposits we are no longer allowed to do that so you would have seen in the quarter that ended in june and then subsequent quarters a big step up in both inventory somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 million and a step up in customer deposits of a similar amount so nothing has changed from an operation standpoint it s simply how we are now required to account for it theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok thanks very much jim lines president and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from joe mondillo sidoti company please proceed with your question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst hi jim jeff good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning joe jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst so i was just wanted to ask you about the chemical petro order trends that you have seen and sort of just wondering what kind of timing this has transpired and just relative to the year the calendar year itself is there any concern or worry just regarding volatility in oil prices and just the general economy overall that these projects could be put back back burnered for a while or continue to be pushed out jim lines president and chief executive officer joe this is jim we don t necessarily have that concern while we are looking at the overall economy seeing if it s slowing down and if that will impact the pace of order decisions what we can judge from the contacts that we have had with our customers is it s not a near term economic decision that was causing them to push order decisions to the right some of it had to do with m a that was going on within our end markets by our customers and then rationalizing their businesses and just waiting until they decided what assets went where we think that s now behind a couple of customers that should enable them to move forward with the projects that are installed based revamps restarting some idle plants or expanding the capability of existing plants we think those are very promising projects there is nothing suggesting that that won t go ahead and also some other work in the petrochemical space around new capacity that seems very solid to us not susceptible to back burner or being shelved which really would be the concern we still feel very optimistic that the order environment across fiscal 20 will translate into backlog expansion in a meaningful way joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then on the oil refining side of things the orders have been sort of fairly stable if you take out the second quarter which is a pretty big quarter what you see going on in that market especially with oil prices certainly being much more volatile knowing that i know that a large part of your customers are the integrated companies and volatile oil prices do effect their businesses and how they manage them so what are you hearing within that side of the business jim lines president and chief executive officer refining on the international front around new capacity we are very excited about the amount of work we ve identified and that we are bidding and that we will participate in at least with the bidding process and that we hope to secure for asia india china elsewhere in asia and there s a very large set of opportunities that are projected to close in 2020 and then also on the domestic front we really don t see a behavioral change by our end markets there the independents will continue to invest and try and find ways to improve throughput and get more fuels out of a barrel of oil and the more integrated refiners i don t see much change there either and so really north america seems stable to us so it appears to be stable with a step up in pet chem joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok great and then on the navy side of things in the past couple of quarters it seems like some work has been pushed out due to timing without the ship build and submarine builds have been sort of progressing can you give us an update on that and how you re thinking about how sort of work or your shipments sort of trend over the next several quarters or couple of years jim lines president and chief executive officer with the adjustments that we made and we spoke about i think it was two quarters ago we are now looking at across 20 of fairly stable quarter to quarter revenue level having now adjusted how the backlog should convert and then it should begin to expand in 21 and 22 just by way of comparison from a rough perspective fy fiscal 20 naval revenue should be comparable to that of 18 and 17 and will be roughly twice what it was in 19 joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok great that does it for me for now thanks for taking my questions jim lines president and chief executive officer you re very welcome thanks joe operator our next question comes from tate sullivan maxim group please proceed with your question tate sullivan maxim group analyst hi thank you thanks for that detail on the navy revenue progression and it sounds like it s stable for 20 what are are there any variables to the timing of delivery to the equipment that you re making for the current aircraft and submarine schedules and what happened before versus what are the risks that something similar can happen again in 20 please for navy orders jim lines president and chief executive officer sure the primary risk around backlog conversion for our naval work is around new vessel program which is the design effort and going through the regulatory approval process to commence fabrication or the next stages of fabrication that can be an execution risk and that represents round numbers maybe half of our backlog business vessel program the more built to print work we re on repeat orders that has a more predictable flow of backlog conversion and then importantly as we look at the opportunities that are beginning to show up in the bid pipeline we do anticipate that there will be some sizable new orders that could come into our backlog across fiscal 20 tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you for that i think i saw it i think it was huntington recently started doing their cutting the steel for the first columbia class submarine correct me if i am wrong but have you given any context for potential margins on your navy work versus your other work i understand if you cannot jim lines president and chief executive officer no we really haven t at a quantitative level more directionally we have indicated that the naval work tends to carry a higher gross margin however will blend as the out margin satisfactorily but we ve not giving any specifics on that for competitive reasons and logical reasons tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you and the last one for me separately i see you retaining some of your power plant business i think it s remaining 11 of your power projects in backlog how is that different i mean besides being a different type of plant is it different types of equipment for different types of power plants or what are you retaining and why did you decide to retain that please jim lines president and chief executive officer sure our held for sale components of our backlog are related to the commercial nuclear utility market we also serve in the power market renewable cogeneration within renewable is geothermal waste energy that s the part of the power segment that we are retaining which has a different execution different sales model different quality programs than would the nuclear market sales tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you very much have a good day jim lines president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities please proceed with your question bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst good morning jim and jeff jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning bill jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning bill bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst excuse me can we still work with the target gross margin looking out to kind of peak cycle in the 30 area is that still a reasonable expectation jim lines president and chief executive officer we have not moved off of that vision and that expectation what has to accompany that though bill just as a footnote or reminder is a stronger order environment that then enables a stronger pricing environment and that typically accompanies the gross margin list that then move out bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right right well based on your commentary things unfolded kind of as i expected 2020 21 that will be pretty good environment for new order growth do you think that environment will be sufficient to support the kind of gross margins that your expecting jim jim lines president and chief executive officer we are certainly more encouraged about the size of our bid pipeline our perceived timing of order placement and the quality of the work that we expect to win it s going to come down too i don t want to be evasive as we talked about over the in the past new capacity has a different margin profile than installed base work international refining work has a different margin profile than domestic refining work pet chem has lowe margin profile than refining work so there is a lot of variables at play but from our qualitative or directional perspective we are expecting that we should see improvement in gross margin after we get through 20 bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst very good on the navy bin as you indicated about half of your backlog was new vessels new capacity i didn t understand exactly where you indicated the other half m a from what kind of work jim lines president and chief executive officer i probably didn t speak very clearly the naval programs there are repeat builds for given vessel programs where the design is already set and then there is a new vessel program where they re building the first vessel and the new class of vessels so we have some work that s for the first vessel of a new class and that has a more labored and a more staged engineering execution time frame the built to print we call it that for description has a more orderly execution flow bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right ok now when you talk about potentially a meaningful pick up in your navy business in 2020 is that related to new vessels or a combination of new plus your repeatable type business jim lines president and chief executive officer that would be and just to qualify that that was on the order front that would be bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right so i am looking on the order front jim lines president and chief executive officer that would be for both surface ships and submarines principally surface ship bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst but would those be new designs or designs you ve already got on to box there jim lines president and chief executive officer they would be designs that we already have completed bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so it ll be your repeatable business then jim lines president and chief executive officer right bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst ok pretty good i know at one point in one of the previous conference calls you indicated that you are broadening out your exposure to potential navy markets is that what we are potentially looking at in 2020 and beyond some examples of that jim lines president and chief executive officer well we want to expand our supply within the programs that we are currently in organically and then we re also looking at how we can structure with m a to get more of the naval spend on the vessel programs or related programs that we are in so one is again doing actions and strategic initiatives to gain more of the spend for what we ordinarily can build and then secondarily because of the strength we see in the multi decade vessel program and the perception the navy has with our capabilities and the quality of our organization can we complement what we currently do with traditional product through an m a approach bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst ok well best of success with those programs and i guess just one follow up question does the sg a guidance that we re looking at does that have your all your increased personnel expenses included in it excuse me jim included in there or do you additional personnel that would be coming up in 2020 though show up in 2021 jim lines president and chief executive officer right the models that we ve given in the guidance reflects the appetite that we have for adding personnel in this current environment and the projected 21 22 environment so we ve incorporated that into our guidance bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so you re pretty well where you want to be then as far as personnel in that regard jeff glajch chief financial officer bill this is jeff just to interject the guidance that jim mentioned does have headcount in there what the guidance does not have is anything related to our commercial nuclear utility business so there will be some sg a that has impacted the company in previous year s financials which would not impact the company in fiscal year 2020 bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so the 2020 guidance if i understand that does not includes sg a from energy steel jeff glajch chief financial officer correct jim lines president and chief executive officer right the 17 million to 18 million excludes the held for sale element of business bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right just like the revenues exclude that business also jim lines president and chief executive officer and it incorporates our vision of adding personnel that go into the sg a cost centers so you shouldn t anticipate us to move above the 17 million to 18 million with the personnel adds that i cited it s already incorporated in that spend in the guidance bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst very good thank you very much jim lines president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from joe mondillo sidoti company please proceed with your question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions i m curious to speaking on energy steel if the divestiture would be accretive to gross margin and or earnings this year not sure if you want to talk about that or divulge that but i d be curious to know jim lines president and chief executive officer accretive to 2020 or accretive had it not been in 19 sorry what s the question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst either way either way however you want to structure it jim lines president and chief executive officer should we be able to divest of energy steel it will be accretive to our margins on a look back basis joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then i also wanted to ask just on sort of cash question on your sort of your cash flow it seems like you may have the last couple of years you ve actually seen working capital as a source of cash with the ramp up in the navy work and maybe even in the petrochem are you anticipating any spend in cash for working capital and then i also wanted i was wondering what your capex budget will be this year jim lines president and chief executive officer joe this is jim we would not anticipate consumption of cash tied to our growth strategies as you might recall we do try to structure progress payments in a manner in which helps us fund procurement of long lead materials but we typically have had continual growth in balance sheet cash even while we ve grown it might be a quarter that has an odd use of cash but over an extended period of time we re not envisioning our operating model changing materially where we would consume cash as we grew and then on the capex side jeff you want to comment on that jeff glajch chief financial officer sure joe capex is targeted to be between 2 5 million and 2 8 million in fiscal 20 just following on jim s question if you would go back over the last decade you will see that our cash position pretty much increased most every year i think there was one year in there where we had and we call that out a very large customer deposit in one year and utilized it the next year but other than that our cash position is pretty continually increased whether we were in a good part of the market or weaker part of the market and as we are coming back into a little bit of a better part of the market we would expect cash flow to continue to be strong and cash position to continue to increase joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst right yeah i m not actually too concerned of that i was specifically asking more so on working capital how you see working capital turn last couple of years it has been a source of cash and i was just asking as you ramp up this navy your navy work and maybe some of the petrochem does working capital is that become a little more do you have to invest a little more in your working capital jeff glajch chief financial officer a little bit but to jim s point we try to tie our projects payments to the work that we are doing so and also as jim mentioned you will see quarters where we move but i think if you look over fiscal years we would not see a significant change in our working capital over any period of time jim lines president and chief executive officer and the phenomena that you saw the very typical phenomena and as we go into a downturn and then if you look at how graham comes out of a downturn into an expansion in our past again we haven t had material working capital changes but we would not anticipate that again joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then just lastly you sort of addressed it briefly just in terms of the cash position overall and potential sort of acquisition targets it sounds like i know you ve talked about in the past and just did recently targeting certain opportunities to take advantage of this naval build out but any other sort of commentary it has obviously been a while where we haven t seen much progress from the outside but i m sure there is some things going on internally not sure if you can provide any more color on sort of the m a opportunity jeff glajch chief financial officer joe yeah i understand it can be frustrating from the outside looking in that nothing has occurred but we have been very active over the past 18 months or so and continue to be very active in both the naval particularly the naval sector but also looking at some aftermarket opportunities in the commercial sector so we are very active we ve talked in the past year or two about opportunities that we are moving out and ultimately we peeled off on so again that could be frustrating from the outside but i assure you that the amount of effort that our business development team and myself and jim personally are spending is significantly greater today than it has been a couple of years back and we just needed to make sure we find that right fit for graham and move forward but right now we re very active it s just until something ultimately moves forward to closure it s hard to say much beyond that joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok understand thanks a lot appreciate it operator our next question comes from bill nicklin from circle n advisors please proceed with your question bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning bill jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning bill bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst good i ve got just one question if we look at the new politics of trade and consider let s say pet chem and refining what kind of changes might you expect and when and where and what configuration you re customers are going to be building in jim lines president and chief executive officer it s a good question complicated question our view is as the on pet chem the investments really relate to where is the lowest cost feed where is the low cost feedstock and right now that s north america and that s the middle east so we don t envision much change in where investments will accrue there around trade politics and in the international markets they still will add pet chem capacity for their growing and emerging economies again we don t see that dynamic changing materially and then on the refining front as we cited earlier india and china are ramping up for some very sizable new capacity adds i don t see global politics or trade modifying that as they invest to satisfy their local consumption they are not expert oriented nations the middle east of course is export oriented they will begin their next wave of refining investment we think in couple of more years so really bill on the overall my long winded response is i guess i don t feel as much change of foot for us bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst ok that s good i was just asking because you hear chatter all the time regarding particularly from the transportation companies that are looking about were petrochemicals are going to be sourced and where they re going to be delivered and are the roots going to change so china may say well we don t buy much or any ethylene from the u s it would seem to me that it would have an negative impact here but maybe a positive impact some place else where maybe raw material would be still sourced from north america but the chemical plants might be built some place else and therefore you could have a pickup in your business down the road jim lines president and chief executive officer sure that s all that s possible what we are identifying now is the as we said a moment ago it s really a race to where s the low cost feedstock and deciding the plants there and then the emerging economies trying to address local demand with local supply with new capacity there bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst all right very good thank you very much jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you bill operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i ll now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you omar and thank you everyone for your questions this morning as we talked through our fourth quarter and the decision we made on energy steel we appreciate the depth of your

be careful what you wish for two years ago ireland led the opposition to the eu digital tax proposals championed by france a key argument used by the irish was that without the americans on board a purely eu plan for taxing the digital economy would not work it would be best they said if this was done by the oecd back then and indeed up to the middle of last year it was assumed that the oecd route was going to be the very slow road to new tax rules because the americans would not want to see their digital champions taxed in ways that might have made them less competitive but conventional opinion was upended when the us administration decided it was indeed time for the digital giants to pay more especially to the us treasury washington has thrown its full weight behind the oecd as indeed has the g20 group of the world s biggest economies the us have also roped in a large swathe of the emerging market and developing countries as well 129 in all in a formation called the inclusive framework and unlike the eu system which some defenders of the tax status quo in ireland have talked up as the bogeyman there is no veto right in this setting its big boys rules now on friday the oecd published its plan to surf this wave of support for a digital tax reform and the wave is rolling fast the working parties get going in june a first progress report is due in december and to hit its target end date of december 2020 an outline of the architecture of the agreement based on detailed technical work will need to be agreed by january this says the oecd will require political engagement and endorsement as the issues at stake for members go beyond technical issues and will have an impact on revenues and the overall balance of taxing rights so there it is as plain as day the right to tax a business activity and the tax money that flows from that right are at stake in this reform the oecd plan comes in two distinct parts or pillars the first a reallocation of taxing rights between market countries where products or more likely digital services are sold and exporting countries where most of the taxing rights currently reside and the second a proposal aiming at a minimum global corporation tax rate including giving countries a right to tax back if a company is not considered to be paying enough tax faced with this reality the irish government decided its best bet was to get stuck into the thick of it and argue its case as best it could in the oecd process after all it had done rather well out of the beps process the previous oecd reform of corporation tax rules the corporation tax take has doubled in five years but if money can flow into the state in an unexpected and unplanned way as a result of changes to oecd rules it can just as easily flow out again leaving the government finances in a real bind corporation tax last year provided almost one euro in every five of the government s tax revenue ibec the business and employers group described the oecd roadmap as the most fundamental change in global corporate tax policy in a century ibec chief economist gerard brady said proposals under pillar 1 will mean some re allocation of taxing rights to larger importing countries and as a small exporting country may mean the irish exchequer will lose a proportion of its corporate tax base irish business however are more concerned about proposals under pillar 2 which would introduce a minimum effective corporate tax rate globally it is crucial for small open economies that this rate if introduced is set at a level which focuses on addressing actual profit shifting concerns and does not infringe on our right to set competitive tax rates in other words this is a fundamental challenge to the irish economic development model that is based on attracting foreign direct investment primarily through the tax system and the network of tax treaties ireland has with other countries in the first pillar the redistribution of taxing rights the work will examine five different approaches to quantifying the amount of profit that could be reallocated to market economies the tax nerds will also have to explore the development of a remote taxable presence that is a taxable presence in a country without a physical presence in the traditional sense of the term and a new set of standards for identifying when such a remote taxable presence exists this gets to the heart of the tax dilemma posed by the digital economy a company can have a huge market position in a country without having any physical presence at all how and where should it pay tax developing a new non physical presence nexus rule would allow market importing countries to tax whatever measure of profits is allocated to them under the new profit allocation rules there will also have to be new measures to avoid double taxation and there is a big administrative hurdle to be overcome without adding to the cost of doing business but the oecd says it will likely result in the need for new data documentation and reporting obligations and this will all need to be reflected in changes to tax treaties the second pillar ideas the ones ibec and the irish government have issues with revolve around the notion of a minimum global corporate tax rate and because of previously aired arguments which the irish strongly supported that it is in reality impossible to separate digital businesses from traditional businesses because all businesses are digital to some degree the anti base erosion measure of a minimum global effective rate would not be limited to digital businesses the new thinking is to propose a systematic solution designed to ensure that all internationally operating businesses pay a minimum level of tax one of the justifications for the minimum effective corporation tax idea is to help developing countries in particular resist pressure from multinationals to grant them sweetheart tax deal that undermine their own tax collecting systems it says of the globally effective anti base erosion measure globe that it could effectively shield developing countries from the pressure to offer inefficient incentives and in doing so help them in better mobilising domestic resources by ensuring that they will be able to effectively tax returns on investment made in their countries the proposal therefore seeks to advance a multilateral framework to achieve a balanced outcome which limits the distortive impact of direct taxes on investment and business location decisions the proposal is also intended as a backstop to pillar one for situations where the relevant profit is booked in a tax rate environment below the minimum rate so an explicit aim is to limit the influence that low tax rates can have on where multinationals decide to locate business units and if the tax advantage is taken away from the irish fdi offer we are going to have to come up with something else to tempt in and keep future multinational investment according to ibec s gerard brady this will require significant investments in areas such as education innovation and quality of life which we have failed to make over recent years and as if to rub it in to the irish the oecd says the minimum global corporation tax measure will be a backstop to the profit allocation and taxing right changes in the first pillar this is one backstop the irish are unlikely to fight tooth and nail for

brazil faces recession risk after econ shrinks in first quarter rio de janeiro brazil s economy shrank in the first quarter of the year official data showed taking latin america s biggest country to the brink of recession for the first time in two years gross domestic product contracted 0 2 percent from the previous quarter the statistics agency said marking the first decline in the key indicator of economic activity since the end of 2016 advertisement the figure confirms what many brazilians already knew two years on from a devastating 2015 2016 recession brazil s economy is still struggling to recover it is bad news for far right president jair bolsonaro who took power in january on a promise to revive the economy and increases pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates the early signs are that growth in the second quarter has been very weak too and there is now a real risk that the economy will slip into a technical recession said william jackson of london based capital economics advertisement a technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of gdp decline when compared to the same period a year ago the economy grew 0 5 percent in the first quarter which jackson said was the slowest pace in two years advertisement the central bank has so far resisted calls to cut its main interest rate which is already at a historic low of 6 5 percent but austin rating chief economist alex agostini said easing inflationary pressure in may had given the bank room to lower rates it is not a question of exchanging growth for inflation but rather avoiding a new recession he said the outlook for brazil s economy is bleak market analysts have pared back their full year growth forecasts for 13 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to grow 1 2 percent that would be only slightly faster than the 1 1 percent growth recorded in 2017 and 2018 necton chief economist andre perfeito is even more pessimistic with a growth forecast of 0 9 percent which he expects to revise down in the coming days economy minister paulo guedes warned recently that brazil was at the bottom of the well the government has slashed its forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 6 percent from an estimate of 2 5 percent early in the year guedes who is spearheading the government s reform agenda threatened to resign last week if the pension bill was not passed or was watered down too much reforms were key to kick starting growth guedes was quoted by the state news agency as saying we re not going to do magic tricks we are going to do serious reforms he said adding to the government s woes is rising unemployment with more than 13 million people out of work the latest jobless data is due on friday one of the factors holding back brazil s recovery is its huge public debt which the international monetary fund estimates to be 88 percent of gdp one of the largest among its peers the commodities driven economy was also hit hard by the deadly collapse of a tailings dam owned by vale in january that forced the mining giant to suspend operations at several mines reducing its output of iron ore and hurting brazil s exports brazil is the latest latin american country to flirt with recession mexico s economy shrank 0 2 percent in the first quarter of the year while argentina is in the grips of a worsening economic crisis but marcos casarin of oxford economics played down the chances of a double dip recession predicting 0 6 percent growth in the current quarter collapsing demand in argentina accounted for nearly half of the decline in exports with negative implications for brazil s manufacturing he said in the second quarter though argentina s demand should be gradually recovering the shrinkage in the brazilian economy comes as bolsonaro s government faces growing opposition only five months into its term stay up to date by following daily express s telegram channel daily express malaysia more protests over recent education spending freezes are taking place thursday weeks after tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets across the country afp
menafn gulf times when governments permit counterfeiting or copying of american products it is stealing our future and it is no longer free trade so said us president ronald reagan commenting on japan after the plaza accord was concluded in september 1985 today resembles in many respects a remake of this 1980s movie but with a reality television star replacing a hollywood film star in the presidential leading role and with a new villain in place of japan back in the 1980s japan was portrayed as america s greatest economic threat not only because of allegations of intellectual property theft but also because of concerns about currency manipulation state sponsored industrial policy a hollowing out of us manufacturing and an outsize bilateral trade deficit in its standoff with the us japan ultimately blinked but it paid a steep price for doing so nearly three lost decades of economic stagnation and deflation today the same plot features china notwithstanding both countries objectionable mercantilism japan and china had something else in common they became victims of america s unfortunate habit of making others the scapegoat for its own economic problems like japan bashing in the 1980s china bashing today is an outgrowth of america s increasingly insidious macroeconomic imbalances in both cases a dramatic shortfall in us domestic saving spawned large current account and trade deficits setting the stage for battles 30 years apart with asia s two economic giants when reagan took office in january 1981 the net domestic saving rate stood at 7 8 of national income and the current account was basically balanced within two and a half years courtesy of reagan s wildly popular tax cuts the domestic saving rate had plunged to 3 7 and the current account and the merchandise trade balances swung into perpetual deficit in this important respect america s so called trade problem was very much of its own making yet the reagan administration was in denial there was little or no appreciation of the link between saving and trade imbalances instead the blame was pinned on japan which accounted for 42 of us goods trade deficits in the first half of the 1980s japan bashing then took on a life of its own with a wide range of grievances over unfair and illegal trade practices leading the charge back then was a young deputy us trade representative named robert lighthizer fast forward some 30 years and the similarities are painfully evident unlike reagan president donald trump did not inherit a us economy with an ample reservoir of saving when trump took office in january 2017 the net domestic saving rate was just 3 well below half the rate at the onset of the reagan era but like his predecessor who waxed eloquently of a new morning in america trump also opted for large tax cuts this time to make america great again the result was a predictable widening of the federal budget deficit which more than offset the cyclical surge in private saving that normally accompanies a maturing economic expansion as a result the net domestic saving rate actually edged down to 2 8 of national income by late 2018 keeping america s international balances deep in the red with the current account deficit at 2 6 of gdp and the merchandise trade gap at 4 5 in late 2018 and that s where china assumes the role that japan played in the 1980s on the surface the threat seems more dire after all china accounted for 48 of the us merchandise trade deficit in 2018 compared to japan s 42 share in the first half of the 1980s but the comparison is distorted by global supply chains which basically didn t exist in the 1980s data from the oecd and the world trade organisation suggest that about 35 40 of the bilateral us china trade deficit reflects inputs made outside of china but assembled and shipped to the us from china that means the made in china portion of today s us trade deficit is actually smaller than japan s share of the 1980s like the japan bashing of the 1980s today s outbreak of china bashing has been conveniently excised from america s broader macroeconomic context that is a serious mistake without raising national saving highly unlikely under the current us budget trajectory trade will simply be shifted away from china to america s other trading partners with this trade diversion likely to migrate to higher cost platforms around the world american consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of a tax hike ironically trump has summoned the same robert lighthizer veteran of the japan trade battles of the 1980s to lead the charge against china unfortunately lighthizer seems as clueless about the macro argument today as he was back then in both episodes the us was in denial bordering on delusion basking in the warm glow of untested supply side economics especially the theory that tax cuts would be self financing the reagan administration failed to appreciate the links between mounting budget and trade deficits today the seductive power of low interest rates coupled with the latest strain of voodoo economics modern monetary theory is equally alluring for the trump administration and a bipartisan consensus of china bashers in the us congress the tough macroeconomic constraints facing a saving short us economy are ignored for good reason there is no us political constituency for reducing trade deficits by cutting budget deficits and thereby boosting domestic saving america wants to have its cake and eat it with a health care system that swallows 18 of its gdp defence spending that exceeds the combined sum of the world s next seven largest military budgets and tax cuts that have reduced federal government revenue to 16 5 of gdp well below the 17 4 average of the past 50 years this remake of an old movie is disconcerting to say the least once again the us has found it far easier to bash others japan then china now than to live within its means this time however the movie might have a very different ending project syndicate stephen s roach a faculty member at yale university and former chairman of morgan stanley asia is the author of unbalanced the

begin jeff jeff glajch chief financial officer thank you karen and good morning everyone if i could have you turn to slide 4 q4 sales grew 7 to 23 6 million in the quarter we had a net loss of 4 6 million which is primarily due to an impairment charge of 5 3 million related to our commercial nuclear utility business which we ve decided to divest we ve initiated the process and are in serious negotiations with a potential buyer excluding the impairment charge we had net income of 800 000 or 0 08 per share orders in the quarter were 21 6 million yielding a 132 1 million year end backlog which while just below the q3 backlog was easily a record for year end backlog for the full year revenue grew 18 to 92 million full year net income was a small loss of 300 000 but was a 5 million of income when excluding the aforementioned impairment charge orders for the year were just above 101 million and again the backlog at the end of the year at 132 million on to slide 5 q4 earnings were similar to the same quarter last year with a 7 higher sales offset by lower gross margins about 210 basis points below last year s q4 the lower margins was primarily due to the commercial nuclear utility business as well as one china project sales in the quarter were 70 domestic 30 international which compares to 66 domestic and 34 international last year the similar ebitda and eps numbers are adjusted for the impairment charge on to slide 6 for the full year sales increased to 91 8 million from 77 5 million sales were 65 domestic 35 international compared with 67 and 33 respectively last year as a side note our commercial nuclear business which as i mentioned we re planning to sell represented above 9 of fiscal year 2019 sales gross profit for the year was 21 9 million up from 17 million primarily due to higher volume as well as 200 basis points higher gross margin at 23 9 sg a was 17 9 million up from 15 8 million last year as we are investing in our business for future growth the adjusted ebitda margin was 7 7 million up from 5 4 million last year and the adjusted net income per diluted share or eps was 0 51 compared with 0 18 last year if you could move to slide 7 our cash position increased 1 3 million in fiscal year 2019 to 77 8 million or 7 90 per share we had good operating cash flow paid 3 8 million in dividends and spent 2 1 million in capital spending in the year in fiscal year 2020 we expect capital spending to be in the 2 5 million to 2 8 million range finally as we look at our balance sheet and our strong cash position we continue to have our business development team our management team and our board focused on the utilizing that balance sheet to opportunistically identify and close on acquisitions which have both near and long term benefits to our shareholders we continue to be excited about the opportunities that we re seeing in our acquisition pipeline jim will now complete our presentation on fiscal year 2019 and comment on our outlook for fiscal 2020 thank you jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you jeff good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter conference call i am picking up where jeff left off at slide 9 refinery and petrochemical end markets showed improvement compared to a quarter and full year comparison this principally was due to stronger activity in our domestic markets for refinery sales there was a good mix of domestic sales to independent and to integrated refiners in most cases these sales were for revamp and debottlenecking projects where refiners invested to improve either throughput or conversion of crude oil to fuels important to note in full year revenue was replacement and metallurgical upgrades from our installed base in the canadian oil sands region i highlight that because one order was rather larger and not necessarily repeatable quarter over quarter refining end market sales were up 1 7 million and for full year sales more than doubled compared to those of fiscal 2018 likewise chemical and petrochemical end market sales are up due to ongoing strength in our domestic markets low cost natural gas in north america which is a principal feedstock for the chemical industry is what has spurred u s investment in new capacity and for revamping or debottlenecking the installed base chemical industry sales doubled quarter over quarter and are up 20 on a full year basis sales through other markets including defense are down quarter over quarter and year on year the primary cause for this which we did address a couple quarters back is a push in fabrication schedule for certain naval orders in backlog this impacted 2019 top line and also will impact 2020 naval work can have that occur especially if orders are for new vessel programs 2019 sales were 65 of total i m sorry 2019 domestic sales were 65 of total for the full year and 70 in the quarter which is similar to 2018 if sales for the naval end market are extracted which can overweight domestic sales sales from 2018 and 2019 were 60 domestic and 40 international please turn your attention to slide 10 the downward trend and trailing 12 month orders is due to customer timing we had expected stronger order levels in the fourth quarter and also in april and may however refining and certain petrochemical customers pushed order decisions we have however developed a large opportunity set of bids for international refining end markets that is projected to close in the coming quarters and there is a significant set of opportunities for u s based petrochemical plants we added to this graph the light blue trend line it was difficult to easily understand the trend of orders from graham s traditional end markets that would exclude u s navy and commercial nuclear utility end markets this is shown with the light blue line and it shows that the trailing 12 month orders are up about 100 from the low watermark ending the second quarter of 2018 while order levels have not been as strong as we anticipated the pipeline for potential orders is strong however with a large number of projects plan to close in fiscal 2020 such that we anticipate that backlog will expand across 2020 on to slide 11 overall and as jeff had said backlog is at a great level of 132 million navy orders are approximately half of the backlog as of march 31 8 million of backlog is for commercial nuclear utility business that is held for sale year on year backlog expanded 12 with considerable expansion of backlog that is for chemical and petrochemical end markets of the 7 of backlog for power end markets 89 of that is related to the held for sale commercial nuclear utility business 55 to 60 of backlog is planned to convert into sales in fiscal 20 10 to 15 is planned for fiscal 20 21 and 25 to 35 beyond fiscal 21 please now turn your attention to slide 12 revenue guidance is between 95 million and 100 million for fiscal 2020 this excludes held for sale commercial nuclear utility business this does represent 14 to 20 top line growth we are structured for greater top line capability however order timing in january through today hasn t played out i mentioned previously that customers pushed order placement decisions in certain cases the push we believe is just a couple of months and in others a couple of quarters nonetheless with order to shipment cycle for large project orders being 12 to 18 months these order placement delays cause us to judge 2020 top line to be in the 95 million to 100 million range gross margin modeling is 23 to 24 i do wish to provide some context for why gross margin is set at this level as i noted we are structured for greater top line capability and additional personnel plan for 2020 will be added based on our multi year outlook for the naval end market and the encouragement that our refining and chemical end market bid pipeline offers i previously noted that we are anticipating year on backlog expansion for fiscal 2020 year end thus personnel adds now are necessary it isn t always possible to align personnel add additions perfectly with corresponding revenue i am investing now for building a bigger better graham and consequently that will pressure margin in 2020 projected sg a spend is 17 million and 18 million for fiscal 2020 our effective tax rate will be approximately 20 omar please open the line now for questions thank you questions answers operator our first question comes from theodore o neill from litchfield please proceed with your question theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst thank you good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning theo theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst jeff i have a question for you on the energy steel business so in fiscal third quarter 2018 you recorded an impairment charge of nearly 15 million against it and you re sighting at that time that it was because of the work stoppage at the virgil c summer nuclear power plant caused by the bankruptcy at westinghouse electric was it the final nail in the coffin for energy steel or is it business environment worsened jeff glajch chief financial officer theo thanks for your question as you ve mentioned we did have a writedown in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 at that point in time it was what was occurring with westinghouse what was occurring with the new bills in north america and the market had weakened some over the last 15 months we have seen for us the market weakened further and as the nuclear promise focus of the nuclear industry has occurred it became apparent to us that they re going to be fewer suppliers and it s going to be downward pressure on pricing in that market and we just felt that we were not well positioned and well integrated enough vertically integrated enough in that market to be successful so the market has worsened and also we ve ended up in a position that was not favorable for us to continue with that market theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok and going forward will that just be recorded as a single line as discontinued operations or is that going to be still part of the whole p l jeff glajch chief financial officer in the immediate term it will be in the p l when you look at the balance sheet you will see asset held for sale as one line and liability held for sale as another line but it will be within the p l it s not considered a discontinued operations from an accounting standpoint our expectation is to have this sale completed possibly this quarter or hopefully not too far into the second quarter but we re targeting having the sale completed ideally by the end of the first quarter theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok on the balance sheet this is fourth quarter in a row where you ve had more than 20 million in inventories and can you talk about the genesis of this and if this is a new normal jeff glajch chief financial officer sure if you would go back and look at the balance sheet as of the end of last fiscal year you would see a significantly lower amount of inventory but you would also see a significantly lower amount of customer deposits one of the changes which occurred with the new revenue recognition rules was that we could no longer on the balance sheet net out the customer deposits which were specifically used to purchase inventory on the balance sheet itself so it used to be we would net out a portion of customer deposits against inventory and then if you look in the footnotes you would see here s the gross inventory here s the net inventory netted for those customer deposits we are no longer allowed to do that so you would have seen in the quarter that ended in june and then subsequent quarters a big step up in both inventory somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 million and a step up in customer deposits of a similar amount so nothing has changed from an operation standpoint it s simply how we are now required to account for it theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok thanks very much jim lines president and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from joe mondillo sidoti company please proceed with your question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst hi jim jeff good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning joe jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst so i was just wanted to ask you about the chemical petro order trends that you have seen and sort of just wondering what kind of timing this has transpired and just relative to the year the calendar year itself is there any concern or worry just regarding volatility in oil prices and just the general economy overall that these projects could be put back back burnered for a while or continue to be pushed out jim lines president and chief executive officer joe this is jim we don t necessarily have that concern while we are looking at the overall economy seeing if it s slowing down and if that will impact the pace of order decisions what we can judge from the contacts that we have had with our customers is it s not a near term economic decision that was causing them to push order decisions to the right some of it had to do with m a that was going on within our end markets by our customers and then rationalizing their businesses and just waiting until they decided what assets went where we think that s now behind a couple of customers that should enable them to move forward with the projects that are installed based revamps restarting some idle plants or expanding the capability of existing plants we think those are very promising projects there is nothing suggesting that that won t go ahead and also some other work in the petrochemical space around new capacity that seems very solid to us not susceptible to back burner or being shelved which really would be the concern we still feel very optimistic that the order environment across fiscal 20 will translate into backlog expansion in a meaningful way joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then on the oil refining side of things the orders have been sort of fairly stable if you take out the second quarter which is a pretty big quarter what you see going on in that market especially with oil prices certainly being much more volatile knowing that i know that a large part of your customers are the integrated companies and volatile oil prices do effect their businesses and how they manage them so what are you hearing within that side of the business jim lines president and chief executive officer refining on the international front around new capacity we are very excited about the amount of work we ve identified and that we are bidding and that we will participate in at least with the bidding process and that we hope to secure for asia india china elsewhere in asia and there s a very large set of opportunities that are projected to close in 2020 and then also on the domestic front we really don t see a behavioral change by our end markets there the independents will continue to invest and try and find ways to improve throughput and get more fuels out of a barrel of oil and the more integrated refiners i don t see much change there either and so really north america seems stable to us so it appears to be stable with a step up in pet chem joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok great and then on the navy side of things in the past couple of quarters it seems like some work has been pushed out due to timing without the ship build and submarine builds have been sort of progressing can you give us an update on that and how you re thinking about how sort of work or your shipments sort of trend over the next several quarters or couple of years jim lines president and chief executive officer with the adjustments that we made and we spoke about i think it was two quarters ago we are now looking at across 20 of fairly stable quarter to quarter revenue level having now adjusted how the backlog should convert and then it should begin to expand in 21 and 22 just by way of comparison from a rough perspective fy fiscal 20 naval revenue should be comparable to that of 18 and 17 and will be roughly twice what it was in 19 joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok great that does it for me for now thanks for taking my questions jim lines president and chief executive officer you re very welcome thanks joe operator our next question comes from tate sullivan maxim group please proceed with your question tate sullivan maxim group analyst hi thank you thanks for that detail on the navy revenue progression and it sounds like it s stable for 20 what are are there any variables to the timing of delivery to the equipment that you re making for the current aircraft and submarine schedules and what happened before versus what are the risks that something similar can happen again in 20 please for navy orders jim lines president and chief executive officer sure the primary risk around backlog conversion for our naval work is around new vessel program which is the design effort and going through the regulatory approval process to commence fabrication or the next stages of fabrication that can be an execution risk and that represents round numbers maybe half of our backlog business vessel program the more built to print work we re on repeat orders that has a more predictable flow of backlog conversion and then importantly as we look at the opportunities that are beginning to show up in the bid pipeline we do anticipate that there will be some sizable new orders that could come into our backlog across fiscal 20 tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you for that i think i saw it i think it was huntington recently started doing their cutting the steel for the first columbia class submarine correct me if i am wrong but have you given any context for potential margins on your navy work versus your other work i understand if you cannot jim lines president and chief executive officer no we really haven t at a quantitative level more directionally we have indicated that the naval work tends to carry a higher gross margin however will blend as the out margin satisfactorily but we ve not giving any specifics on that for competitive reasons and logical reasons tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you and the last one for me separately i see you retaining some of your power plant business i think it s remaining 11 of your power projects in backlog how is that different i mean besides being a different type of plant is it different types of equipment for different types of power plants or what are you retaining and why did you decide to retain that please jim lines president and chief executive officer sure our held for sale components of our backlog are related to the commercial nuclear utility market we also serve in the power market renewable cogeneration within renewable is geothermal waste energy that s the part of the power segment that we are retaining which has a different execution different sales model different quality programs than would the nuclear market sales tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you very much have a good day jim lines president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities please proceed with your question bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst good morning jim and jeff jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning bill jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning bill bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst excuse me can we still work with the target gross margin looking out to kind of peak cycle in the 30 area is that still a reasonable expectation jim lines president and chief executive officer we have not moved off of that vision and that expectation what has to accompany that though bill just as a footnote or reminder is a stronger order environment that then enables a stronger pricing environment and that typically accompanies the gross margin list that then move out bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right right well based on your commentary things unfolded kind of as i expected 2020 21 that will be pretty good environment for new order growth do you think that environment will be sufficient to support the kind of gross margins that your expecting jim jim lines president and chief executive officer we are certainly more encouraged about the size of our bid pipeline our perceived timing of order placement and the quality of the work that we expect to win it s going to come down too i don t want to be evasive as we talked about over the in the past new capacity has a different margin profile than installed base work international refining work has a different margin profile than domestic refining work pet chem has lowe margin profile than refining work so there is a lot of variables at play but from our qualitative or directional perspective we are expecting that we should see improvement in gross margin after we get through 20 bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst very good on the navy bin as you indicated about half of your backlog was new vessels new capacity i didn t understand exactly where you indicated the other half m a from what kind of work jim lines president and chief executive officer i probably didn t speak very clearly the naval programs there are repeat builds for given vessel programs where the design is already set and then there is a new vessel program where they re building the first vessel and the new class of vessels so we have some work that s for the first vessel of a new class and that has a more labored and a more staged engineering execution time frame the built to print we call it that for description has a more orderly execution flow bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right ok now when you talk about potentially a meaningful pick up in your navy business in 2020 is that related to new vessels or a combination of new plus your repeatable type business jim lines president and chief executive officer that would be and just to qualify that that was on the order front that would be bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right so i am looking on the order front jim lines president and chief executive officer that would be for both surface ships and submarines principally surface ship bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst but would those be new designs or designs you ve already got on to box there jim lines president and chief executive officer they would be designs that we already have completed bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so it ll be your repeatable business then jim lines president and chief executive officer right bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst ok pretty good i know at one point in one of the previous conference calls you indicated that you are broadening out your exposure to potential navy markets is that what we are potentially looking at in 2020 and beyond some examples of that jim lines president and chief executive officer well we want to expand our supply within the programs that we are currently in organically and then we re also looking at how we can structure with m a to get more of the naval spend on the vessel programs or related programs that we are in so one is again doing actions and strategic initiatives to gain more of the spend for what we ordinarily can build and then secondarily because of the strength we see in the multi decade vessel program and the perception the navy has with our capabilities and the quality of our organization can we complement what we currently do with traditional product through an m a approach bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst ok well best of success with those programs and i guess just one follow up question does the sg a guidance that we re looking at does that have your all your increased personnel expenses included in it excuse me jim included in there or do you additional personnel that would be coming up in 2020 though show up in 2021 jim lines president and chief executive officer right the models that we ve given in the guidance reflects the appetite that we have for adding personnel in this current environment and the projected 21 22 environment so we ve incorporated that into our guidance bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so you re pretty well where you want to be then as far as personnel in that regard jeff glajch chief financial officer bill this is jeff just to interject the guidance that jim mentioned does have headcount in there what the guidance does not have is anything related to our commercial nuclear utility business so there will be some sg a that has impacted the company in previous year s financials which would not impact the company in fiscal year 2020 bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so the 2020 guidance if i understand that does not includes sg a from energy steel jeff glajch chief financial officer correct jim lines president and chief executive officer right the 17 million to 18 million excludes the held for sale element of business bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right just like the revenues exclude that business also jim lines president and chief executive officer and it incorporates our vision of adding personnel that go into the sg a cost centers so you shouldn t anticipate us to move above the 17 million to 18 million with the personnel adds that i cited it s already incorporated in that spend in the guidance bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst very good thank you very much jim lines president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from joe mondillo sidoti company please proceed with your question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions i m curious to speaking on energy steel if the divestiture would be accretive to gross margin and or earnings this year not sure if you want to talk about that or divulge that but i d be curious to know jim lines president and chief executive officer accretive to 2020 or accretive had it not been in 19 sorry what s the question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst either way either way however you want to structure it jim lines president and chief executive officer should we be able to divest of energy steel it will be accretive to our margins on a look back basis joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then i also wanted to ask just on sort of cash question on your sort of your cash flow it seems like you may have the last couple of years you ve actually seen working capital as a source of cash with the ramp up in the navy work and maybe even in the petrochem are you anticipating any spend in cash for working capital and then i also wanted i was wondering what your capex budget will be this year jim lines president and chief executive officer joe this is jim we would not anticipate consumption of cash tied to our growth strategies as you might recall we do try to structure progress payments in a manner in which helps us fund procurement of long lead materials but we typically have had continual growth in balance sheet cash even while we ve grown it might be a quarter that has an odd use of cash but over an extended period of time we re not envisioning our operating model changing materially where we would consume cash as we grew and then on the capex side jeff you want to comment on that jeff glajch chief financial officer sure joe capex is targeted to be between 2 5 million and 2 8 million in fiscal 20 just following on jim s question if you would go back over the last decade you will see that our cash position pretty much increased most every year i think there was one year in there where we had and we call that out a very large customer deposit in one year and utilized it the next year but other than that our cash position is pretty continually increased whether we were in a good part of the market or weaker part of the market and as we are coming back into a little bit of a better part of the market we would expect cash flow to continue to be strong and cash position to continue to increase joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst right yeah i m not actually too concerned of that i was specifically asking more so on working capital how you see working capital turn last couple of years it has been a source of cash and i was just asking as you ramp up this navy your navy work and maybe some of the petrochem does working capital is that become a little more do you have to invest a little more in your working capital jeff glajch chief financial officer a little bit but to jim s point we try to tie our projects payments to the work that we are doing so and also as jim mentioned you will see quarters where we move but i think if you look over fiscal years we would not see a significant change in our working capital over any period of time jim lines president and chief executive officer and the phenomena that you saw the very typical phenomena and as we go into a downturn and then if you look at how graham comes out of a downturn into an expansion in our past again we haven t had material working capital changes but we would not anticipate that again joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then just lastly you sort of addressed it briefly just in terms of the cash position overall and potential sort of acquisition targets it sounds like i know you ve talked about in the past and just did recently targeting certain opportunities to take advantage of this naval build out but any other sort of commentary it has obviously been a while where we haven t seen much progress from the outside but i m sure there is some things going on internally not sure if you can provide any more color on sort of the m a opportunity jeff glajch chief financial officer joe yeah i understand it can be frustrating from the outside looking in that nothing has occurred but we have been very active over the past 18 months or so and continue to be very active in both the naval particularly the naval sector but also looking at some aftermarket opportunities in the commercial sector so we are very active we ve talked in the past year or two about opportunities that we are moving out and ultimately we peeled off on so again that could be frustrating from the outside but i assure you that the amount of effort that our business development team and myself and jim personally are spending is significantly greater today than it has been a couple of years back and we just needed to make sure we find that right fit for graham and move forward but right now we re very active it s just until something ultimately moves forward to closure it s hard to say much beyond that joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok understand thanks a lot appreciate it operator our next question comes from bill nicklin from circle n advisors please proceed with your question bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning bill jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning bill bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst good i ve got just one question if we look at the new politics of trade and consider let s say pet chem and refining what kind of changes might you expect and when and where and what configuration you re customers are going to be building in jim lines president and chief executive officer it s a good question complicated question our view is as the on pet chem the investments really relate to where is the lowest cost feed where is the low cost feedstock and right now that s north america and that s the middle east so we don t envision much change in where investments will accrue there around trade politics and in the international markets they still will add pet chem capacity for their growing and emerging economies again we don t see that dynamic changing materially and then on the refining front as we cited earlier india and china are ramping up for some very sizable new capacity adds i don t see global politics or trade modifying that as they invest to satisfy their local consumption they are not expert oriented nations the middle east of course is export oriented they will begin their next wave of refining investment we think in couple of more years so really bill on the overall my long winded response is i guess i don t feel as much change of foot for us bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst ok that s good i was just asking because you hear chatter all the time regarding particularly from the transportation companies that are looking about were petrochemicals are going to be sourced and where they re going to be delivered and are the roots going to change so china may say well we don t buy much or any ethylene from the u s it would seem to me that it would have an negative impact here but maybe a positive impact some place else where maybe raw material would be still sourced from north america but the chemical plants might be built some place else and therefore you could have a pickup in your business down the road jim lines president and chief executive officer sure that s all that s possible what we are identifying now is the as we said a moment ago it s really a race to where s the low cost feedstock and deciding the plants there and then the emerging economies trying to address local demand with local supply with new capacity there bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst all right very good thank you very much jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you bill operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i ll now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you omar and thank you everyone for your questions this morning as we talked through our fourth quarter and the decision we made on energy steel we appreciate the depth of your

credit bruce mohl commonwealth magazine may 31 2019 commonwealthmagazine org translate from english to english translate from english to english translate from english to english the baker administration is pushing ahead with plans to double the procurement of offshore wind power over the next several years a move that will increase wind s share of the state s energy portfolio to 30 percent while locking massachusetts into long term contracts for nearly two thirds of its electricity the announcement was another sign of just how bullish the state is on offshore wind but it also highlighted some of the risks involved in negotiating 20 year contracts directly with electricity suppliers instead of relying on the region s competitive wholesale electricity market right now offshore wind appears to be a great fit in terms of price and environmental benefits but if new technologies emerge in the near future driving down the price of solar or other emerging renewables ratepayers could be stuck paying above market prices for their power legislation approved on beacon hill in 2016 authorized the state s utilities acting on behalf of their ratepayers to negotiate contracts for 1 600 megawatts of electricity the first contract for 800 megawatts was awarded to vineyard wind last year and another 800 megawatt procurement is expected to be awarded by the end of this year under legislation approved last year the state department of energy resources was required to analyze the market for offshore wind and decide whether it made sense to double down and procure another 1 600 megawatts the report released on friday concludes it makes sense to do procurements for the additional 1 600 megawatts in 2022 2024 and again in 2026 if necessary the report also recommends conducting a solicitation in 2020 to see if it would make sense to construct an independently built transmission line that would serve all of the new wind farms until now wind farm operators have preferred to build their own individual transmission lines to shore but state officials think there may be environmental benefits from minimizing the number of transmission lines as the industry expands the state report portrays offshore wind as a very good deal for the state providing renewable power at an attractive price point the report said offshore wind farms on an annual basis operate at 50 percent of their capacity meaning they generate half the electricity they are capable of generating because the wind isn t always blowing and tend to reliably generate power during the winter months when natural gas for power plants can sometimes be in short supply a chart in the report noted the vineyard wind contract price was 6 5 cents per kilowatt hour in 2017 dollars slightly higher than the price of quebec hydro electricity being purchased in a separate procurement and double the price of electricity produced with natural gas the offshore wind price was half the price of the state s least subsidized solar power option the report estimated the contracts for an additional 1 600 megawatts of electricity will save the state s ratepayers between 670 million and 1 27 billion over the life of the 20 year contracts patrick woodcock the deputy secretary of energy said it s unclear whether the energy savings would continue if more than 3 200 megawatts of offshore wind electricity were procured he said the analysis by the department of energy resources indicated savings from offshore wind would begin to diminish at some point the report also raised concerns about the state s growing reliance on long term contracts for renewable energy the operator of the region s power grid currently runs two energy markets one day to day and the other longer term that in broad terms pit power generators against each other with business flowing to those able to deliver electricity at the lowest price the markets have had difficulty accommodating offshore wind farms because the wind farms have significant upfront construction costs that are difficult to recoup in the regional energy markets with massachusetts in need of clean energy to meet its emissions targets the state has increasingly negotiated long term deals outside of the regional power markets to get offshore wind farms and other renewable projects built according to the state report the state s three utilities currently have 62 long term contracts with renewable energy suppliers for a total commitment of 22 billion with the extra 1 600 megawatts 60 percent of the state s electricity load will come from long term contracts the report said the long term contracts change the regional market dynamic considerably with the regional power markets generators vie for sales and have to absorb any financial losses if their power plants are unable to compete for business with the long term contracts granted to renewable energy suppliers the risk for any financial losses shifts back to ratepayers the high amount of energy tied up in long term contracts may impact wholesale markets and may shift risk to ratepayers as energy markets change the state report said woodcock said the offshore wind market itself illustrates how quickly the market can change he said vineyard wind originally planned to populate its wind farm with 6 5 megawatt turbines but turbine technology has changed so much over the last 1 ½ years that the company is moving to a 9 5 megawatt turbine that just signals how much change is happening he said the report recommended the legislature give the department of energy resources the option of including other renewable resources in future solicitations to increase competition for long term contracts and to take advantage of technological changes as they arise another concern raised by the report is that competition is increasing from other states for the onshore economic development associated with offshore wind farms many on the south coast have been worried that the focus on price in the state contracting process has hurt efforts to convince companies to build more production facilities in massachusetts other states are pursuing the industry aggressively the report said new jersey has a 100 million offshore wind tax credit program new york is spending 200 million on port infrastructure and connecticut is investing 35 5 million in the new london port the department of energy resources said the state should consider separate investments in onshore infrastructure to entice more of the industry food chain for offshore wind the assumption that economic development will be secured solely through procurements no longer holds true the report said it is worthwhile to continue to look at economic development outside the procurements to enable an industry cluster to develop in the commonwealth
politics government as campaign begins what will you pay under the illinois progressive state income tax plan the illinois house of representatives vote to place a constitutional amendment on the november 2020 ballot to allow for a change from a flat tax system sets up almost a year and a half of campaigning on a progressive income tax but what exactly will illinois residents be voting on voters won t have a say in setting the rates rather they will be deciding whether to remove the flat income tax provision in the state s constitution having a progressive income tax system in the state was one of gov j b pritzker s campaign promises when he ran to unseat former gov bruce rauner now that he s in office he and fellow democrats have dubbed their proposal the fair tax the amendment proposal removes the requirement of a flat income tax system currently the state income tax is a flat 4 95 percent of income for everyone if passed the ballot issue would allow the state to have a graduated income tax system where people who earn more money would pay higher rates in order to remove the flat tax provision 60 percent of people voting on the amendment or 50 percent of people voting in the election have to approve of the measure as part of the efforts to gain support the democratically controlled legislature passed a bill that included income tax rates that would be used if the amendment was passed outside of the top brackets the marginal tax rates in the plan are 4 75 percent for income 0 to 10 000 4 9 percent from 10 001 to 100 000 4 95 percent from 100 001 to 250 000 or married couples the tax rate would be 7 75 percent from 250 001 to 500 000 and 7 85 percent from 500 001 to 1 million income more than 1 million would be taxed at 7 99 percent for single filing persons tax rates are the same up to 250 000 while the 7 75 percent rate applies from 250 001 to 350 000 and the 7 85 percent rate applies from 350 001 to 750 000 income higher than 750 000 would be taxed at 7 99 percent the corporate tax rate would be raised to 7 99 percent from its current 7 percent rate businesses also pay a corporate property replacement tax however which makes the top corporate rate 10 49 percent under the senate plan the possible tax rates would bring in 3 325 billion worth of new revenue according to estimates and would help fix the state s structural budget deficit proponents say proponents have said 97 percent of illinoisians would either pay the same or less in income taxes when the house approved those rates on thursday state rep jay hoffman d swansea was among those to vote yes i think we should set the rates and let the public look at what we intend to pass make it all public so they could all vote knowing what the rates would be hoffman said the governor did agree to a task force to review ways to bring about property tax relief and to review the causes of high property taxes in order to secure a swing vote in the house when it agreed to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot before this goes to the voters i think we have an obligation to be real and serious about significant property tax reform said hoffman who is a democratic leader in the house i think that burden is the most unfair the most significantly unfair burden of any taxation we have in our system i think this can be used as a mechanism for long term reform in the property tax system republicans in the legislature have universally opposed the efforts for a graduated income tax system opponents have called it a blank check which would lead to higher tax rates in the future especially if there is another economic downturn our friends on the other side of the aisle they seem to message that raising taxes is almost an act of courage raising taxes is the opposite of courage said state rep blaine wilhour r beecher city during a news conference last week real courage would be dealing with the real and substantial underlying issues that are holding our economy in the state of illinois down raising taxes in illinois has become par for the course the reality is taxes continue to rise but the underlying financial problems continue to get worse despite having the highest combined state and local taxes in the nation illinois has the third worst underfunded pension system in america we have billions of dollars in unpaid bills and we are among the least prepared state for an economic downturn we have no rainy day fund state rep blaine wilhour r beecher city speaks during a may 22 2019 news conference in springfield about the need for spending reforms in illinois rather than tax increases joseph bustos jbustos bnd com he argued during the news conference in springfield that the state needs to stop adding mandates on businesses to help improve the business climate and pension reform here s the bottom line this is a blank check from the taxpayers to springfield politicians until we get our financial act together we shouldn t be asking for more taxpayer money wilhour said republicans have argued the progressive income tax would allow democrats to tax and spend as much as they want a graduated tax is bad policy for illinois the legislation passed today is estimated to take 3 4 billion more out of the pockets of hard working people in our state said state rep charlie meier r okawville it will have a negative impact on farmers small businesses working families and economic development throughout my district chicago politicians have a history of increasing incomes taxes and increasing spending a graduated tax will only make it easier for politicians to increase income taxes in the future just last month our state brought in 1 5 billion more in revenue than estimated yet this year democrats are planning on spending every dime by creating new programs instead of paying down illinois 6 5 billion in unpaid bills we need to stop the income tax hikes and stop the spending we have a spending problem not a revenue problem which is why i voted against the graduated income tax hike democrats in conservative districts as the campaigning begins for a graduated income tax all 118 members of the house of representatives will be up for election including democrats who live in districts where the idea of a progressive income tax may not be popular now that state rep nathan reitz d steeleville has voted in favor of placing a graduated income tax on the november 2020 ballot he could face political fallout political observers have noted reitz replaced jerry costello ii a conservative democrat who was against a progressive income tax in the state costello was appointed to be director of law enforcement for the illinois department of natural resources the illinois house republican organization the campaign committee for the house republicans said polling released by the illinois policy institute showed that a progressive income tax is not popular in reitz s district in southern illinois only 22 percent of respondents in the 116th district are in the favor of the measure the poll found 41 percent of respondents were against the constitutional amendment while only 22 percent support rep reitz s view of putting a constitutional amendment on the ballot making it easier to raise taxes the newly placed representative still maintains 100 percent support of one key out of district constituent governor pritzker said jayme odom executive director of the house republican organization it s now apparent the governor pushed out former rep costello to lock up a pivotal tax hiking vote from the 116th district reitz in a statement after the vote said 99 6 percent of residents in his district would pay either the same or less in property taxes since taking office i ve made it very clear that my goals have been providing much needed tax relief to middle class and working families as a driver to leverage our economy to create new jobs and protect critical access to health care reitz said there has been a lot of misinformation on both sides of this issue but when you put that aside the reality is that this plan puts us on a path to provide modest tax relief for a majority of southern illinoisans this amendment simply allows voters to make the first decision if our state should change its tax structure when we talk about investing more in our local communities our schools our social services the fair tax plan deserves to be part of that conversation the conservative leaning illinois policy institute also contended the measure is unpopular in the districts represented by state rep monica bristow d godfrey and state rep katie stuart d edwardsville both of whom voted yes on the graduated income tax bill reitz and bristow both voted no on the bill thursday that set what the rates would be if voters approved the constitutional amendment stuart who voted against the 2017 income tax increase defended her vote on monday to put the question on the ballot throughout my time as state representative i have fought against all new tax proposals and voted against the income tax hike that took effect in 2017 because i know that local families are being crushed by an unfair tax system stuart said working families in the metro east are struggling so i supported a fair tax as a necessary first step in building a stronger illinois by building a stronger middle class stuart argued 98 2 percent of residents in her district would pay less or the same in income taxes under the house plan i supported the fair tax amendment to give local families a say in whether we should continue the status quo of our regressive tax structure or if we should address our unfair tax system and call on millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share stuart said bristow had a very close election in november 2018 when she defeated republican mike babcock by 356 votes which amounted to one percentage point pritzker was grateful for the support of democrats in tough districts to put the question on the ballot what s interesting in their districts they did the right thing and very much appreciate their support for the fair tax pritzker said at an unrelated news conference on thursday remember their districts more than 99 percent of people in their districts are going to get tax relief or pay no more and so the dollars that we re able to fill the problem in state government and state budget with are also dollars that will come to their district so it s good for the people of their district that they ve done it supported it and i very much appreciate it the fair tax let s remember is all about putting the state on firm fiscal footing for the future to make sure we can balance the budgets in the future more tv ads to come think big illinois a dark money group launched by a pritzker ally had already been running television commercials to build support for a progressive income tax even prior to the memorial day vote with the amendment question slated for the november 2020 ballot campaigns with fliers will most likely flood mailboxes and television ads will be seen on the airwaves leading up to the election which includes voting for president now that voters will have the chance to decide in november 2020 think big illinois will make the case that for every corner of the state the fair tax is the way to lift the burden on middle class families generate much needed funding for our schools and put our state back on the path to fiscal sustainability said lara sisselman the communications director for think big il we believe that when voters across the state know the truth about the fair tax they ll vote for it on the ballot and we ll be using all of the tools at our disposal to make that case ideas illinois a group that is against the progressive income tax sent out an email to supporters entitled they got away with it as a fundraising appeal to campaign against the constitutional amendment for the next year and a half the group has called a progressive income tax a jobs tax and would further drive people and businesses out of the state speaker mike madigan and gov pritzker will say a lot in the months ahead but what they won t tell voters is that those states who have passed similar methods of taxation have seen job creators flee in droves and passage of this tax will be one more nail in the coffin of the illinois economy

good morning everyone if i could have you turn to slide 4 q4 sales grew 7 to 23 6 million in the quarter we had a net loss of 4 6 million which is primarily due to an impairment charge of 5 3 million related to our commercial nuclear utility business which we ve decided to divest we ve initiated the process and are in serious negotiations with a potential buyer excluding the impairment charge we had net income of 800 000 or 0 08 per share orders in the quarter were 21 6 million yielding a 132 1 million year end backlog which while just below the q3 backlog was easily a record for year end backlog for the full year revenue grew 18 to 92 million full year net income was a small loss of 300 000 but was a 5 million of income when excluding the aforementioned impairment charge orders for the year were just above 101 million and again the backlog at the end of the year at 132 million on to slide 5 q4 earnings were similar to the same quarter last year with a 7 higher sales offset by lower gross margins about 210 basis points below last year s q4 the lower margins was primarily due to the commercial nuclear utility business as well as one china project sales in the quarter were 70 domestic 30 international which compares to 66 domestic and 34 international last year the similar ebitda and eps numbers are adjusted for the impairment charge on to slide 6 for the full year sales increased to 91 8 million from 77 5 million sales were 65 domestic 35 international compared with 67 and 33 respectively last year as a side note our commercial nuclear business which as i mentioned we re planning to sell represented above 9 of fiscal year 2019 sales gross profit for the year was 21 9 million up from 17 million primarily due to higher volume as well as 200 basis points higher gross margin at 23 9 sg a was 17 9 million up from 15 8 million last year as we are investing in our business for future growth the adjusted ebitda margin was 7 7 million up from 5 4 million last year and the adjusted net income per diluted share or eps was 0 51 compared with 0 18 last year if you could move to slide 7 our cash position increased 1 3 million in fiscal year 2019 to 77 8 million or 7 90 per share we had good operating cash flow paid 3 8 million in dividends and spent 2 1 million in capital spending in the year in fiscal year 2020 we expect capital spending to be in the 2 5 million to 2 8 million range finally as we look at our balance sheet and our strong cash position we continue to have our business development team our management team and our board focused on the utilizing that balance sheet to opportunistically identify and close on acquisitions which have both near and long term benefits to our shareholders we continue to be excited about the opportunities that we re seeing in our acquisition pipeline jim will now complete our presentation on fiscal year 2019 and comment on our outlook for fiscal 2020 thank you jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you jeff good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter conference call i am picking up where jeff left off at slide 9 refinery and petrochemical end markets showed improvement compared to a quarter and full year comparison this principally was due to stronger activity in our domestic markets for refinery sales there was a good mix of domestic sales to independent and to integrated refiners in most cases these sales were for revamp and debottlenecking projects where refiners invested to improve either throughput or conversion of crude oil to fuels important to note in full year revenue was replacement and metallurgical upgrades from our installed base in the canadian oil sands region i highlight that because one order was rather larger and not necessarily repeatable quarter over quarter refining end market sales were up 1 7 million and for full year sales more than doubled compared to those of fiscal 2018 likewise chemical and petrochemical end market sales are up due to ongoing strength in our domestic markets low cost natural gas in north america which is a principal feedstock for the chemical industry is what has spurred u s investment in new capacity and for revamping or debottlenecking the installed base chemical industry sales doubled quarter over quarter and are up 20 on a full year basis sales through other markets including defense are down quarter over quarter and year on year the primary cause for this which we did address a couple quarters back is a push in fabrication schedule for certain naval orders in backlog this impacted 2019 top line and also will impact 2020 naval work can have that occur especially if orders are for new vessel programs 2019 sales were 65 of total i m sorry 2019 domestic sales were 65 of total for the full year and 70 in the quarter which is similar to 2018 if sales for the naval end market are extracted which can overweight domestic sales sales from 2018 and 2019 were 60 domestic and 40 international please turn your attention to slide 10 the downward trend and trailing 12 month orders is due to customer timing we had expected stronger order levels in the fourth quarter and also in april and may however refining and certain petrochemical customers pushed order decisions we have however developed a large opportunity set of bids for international refining end markets that is projected to close in the coming quarters and there is a significant set of opportunities for u s based petrochemical plants we added to this graph the light blue trend line it was difficult to easily understand the trend of orders from graham s traditional end markets that would exclude u s navy and commercial nuclear utility end markets this is shown with the light blue line and it shows that the trailing 12 month orders are up about 100 from the low watermark ending the second quarter of 2018 while order levels have not been as strong as we anticipated the pipeline for potential orders is strong however with a large number of projects plan to close in fiscal 2020 such that we anticipate that backlog will expand across 2020 on to slide 11 overall and as jeff had said backlog is at a great level of 132 million navy orders are approximately half of the backlog as of march 31 8 million of backlog is for commercial nuclear utility business that is held for sale year on year backlog expanded 12 with considerable expansion of backlog that is for chemical and petrochemical end markets of the 7 of backlog for power end markets 89 of that is related to the held for sale commercial nuclear utility business 55 to 60 of backlog is planned to convert into sales in fiscal 20 10 to 15 is planned for fiscal 20 21 and 25 to 35 beyond fiscal 21 please now turn your attention to slide 12 revenue guidance is between 95 million and 100 million for fiscal 2020 this excludes held for sale commercial nuclear utility business this does represent 14 to 20 top line growth we are structured for greater top line capability however order timing in january through today hasn t played out i mentioned previously that customers pushed order placement decisions in certain cases the push we believe is just a couple of months and in others a couple of quarters nonetheless with order to shipment cycle for large project orders being 12 to 18 months these order placement delays cause us to judge 2020 top line to be in the 95 million to 100 million range gross margin modeling is 23 to 24 i do wish to provide some context for why gross margin is set at this level as i noted we are structured for greater top line capability and additional personnel plan for 2020 will be added based on our multi year outlook for the naval end market and the encouragement that our refining and chemical end market bid pipeline offers i previously noted that we are anticipating year on backlog expansion for fiscal 2020 year end thus personnel adds now are necessary it isn t always possible to align personnel add additions perfectly with corresponding revenue i am investing now for building a bigger better graham and consequently that will pressure margin in 2020 projected sg a spend is 17 million and 18 million for fiscal 2020 our effective tax rate will be approximately 20 omar please open the line now for questions thank you questions answers operator our first question comes from theodore o neill from litchfield please proceed with your question theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst thank you good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning theo theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst jeff i have a question for you on the energy steel business so in fiscal third quarter 2018 you recorded an impairment charge of nearly 15 million against it and you re sighting at that time that it was because of the work stoppage at the virgil c summer nuclear power plant caused by the bankruptcy at westinghouse electric was it the final nail in the coffin for energy steel or is it business environment worsened jeff glajch chief financial officer theo thanks for your question as you ve mentioned we did have a writedown in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 at that point in time it was what was occurring with westinghouse what was occurring with the new bills in north america and the market had weakened some over the last 15 months we have seen for us the market weakened further and as the nuclear promise focus of the nuclear industry has occurred it became apparent to us that they re going to be fewer suppliers and it s going to be downward pressure on pricing in that market and we just felt that we were not well positioned and well integrated enough vertically integrated enough in that market to be successful so the market has worsened and also we ve ended up in a position that was not favorable for us to continue with that market theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok and going forward will that just be recorded as a single line as discontinued operations or is that going to be still part of the whole p l jeff glajch chief financial officer in the immediate term it will be in the p l when you look at the balance sheet you will see asset held for sale as one line and liability held for sale as another line but it will be within the p l it s not considered a discontinued operations from an accounting standpoint our expectation is to have this sale completed possibly this quarter or hopefully not too far into the second quarter but we re targeting having the sale completed ideally by the end of the first quarter theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok on the balance sheet this is fourth quarter in a row where you ve had more than 20 million in inventories and can you talk about the genesis of this and if this is a new normal jeff glajch chief financial officer sure if you would go back and look at the balance sheet as of the end of last fiscal year you would see a significantly lower amount of inventory but you would also see a significantly lower amount of customer deposits one of the changes which occurred with the new revenue recognition rules was that we could no longer on the balance sheet net out the customer deposits which were specifically used to purchase inventory on the balance sheet itself so it used to be we would net out a portion of customer deposits against inventory and then if you look in the footnotes you would see here s the gross inventory here s the net inventory netted for those customer deposits we are no longer allowed to do that so you would have seen in the quarter that ended in june and then subsequent quarters a big step up in both inventory somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 million and a step up in customer deposits of a similar amount so nothing has changed from an operation standpoint it s simply how we are now required to account for it theodore o neill litchfield hills research llc analyst ok thanks very much jim lines president and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from joe mondillo sidoti company please proceed with your question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst hi jim jeff good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning joe jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst so i was just wanted to ask you about the chemical petro order trends that you have seen and sort of just wondering what kind of timing this has transpired and just relative to the year the calendar year itself is there any concern or worry just regarding volatility in oil prices and just the general economy overall that these projects could be put back back burnered for a while or continue to be pushed out jim lines president and chief executive officer joe this is jim we don t necessarily have that concern while we are looking at the overall economy seeing if it s slowing down and if that will impact the pace of order decisions what we can judge from the contacts that we have had with our customers is it s not a near term economic decision that was causing them to push order decisions to the right some of it had to do with m a that was going on within our end markets by our customers and then rationalizing their businesses and just waiting until they decided what assets went where we think that s now behind a couple of customers that should enable them to move forward with the projects that are installed based revamps restarting some idle plants or expanding the capability of existing plants we think those are very promising projects there is nothing suggesting that that won t go ahead and also some other work in the petrochemical space around new capacity that seems very solid to us not susceptible to back burner or being shelved which really would be the concern we still feel very optimistic that the order environment across fiscal 20 will translate into backlog expansion in a meaningful way joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then on the oil refining side of things the orders have been sort of fairly stable if you take out the second quarter which is a pretty big quarter what you see going on in that market especially with oil prices certainly being much more volatile knowing that i know that a large part of your customers are the integrated companies and volatile oil prices do effect their businesses and how they manage them so what are you hearing within that side of the business jim lines president and chief executive officer refining on the international front around new capacity we are very excited about the amount of work we ve identified and that we are bidding and that we will participate in at least with the bidding process and that we hope to secure for asia india china elsewhere in asia and there s a very large set of opportunities that are projected to close in 2020 and then also on the domestic front we really don t see a behavioral change by our end markets there the independents will continue to invest and try and find ways to improve throughput and get more fuels out of a barrel of oil and the more integrated refiners i don t see much change there either and so really north america seems stable to us so it appears to be stable with a step up in pet chem joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok great and then on the navy side of things in the past couple of quarters it seems like some work has been pushed out due to timing without the ship build and submarine builds have been sort of progressing can you give us an update on that and how you re thinking about how sort of work or your shipments sort of trend over the next several quarters or couple of years jim lines president and chief executive officer with the adjustments that we made and we spoke about i think it was two quarters ago we are now looking at across 20 of fairly stable quarter to quarter revenue level having now adjusted how the backlog should convert and then it should begin to expand in 21 and 22 just by way of comparison from a rough perspective fy fiscal 20 naval revenue should be comparable to that of 18 and 17 and will be roughly twice what it was in 19 joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok great that does it for me for now thanks for taking my questions jim lines president and chief executive officer you re very welcome thanks joe operator our next question comes from tate sullivan maxim group please proceed with your question tate sullivan maxim group analyst hi thank you thanks for that detail on the navy revenue progression and it sounds like it s stable for 20 what are are there any variables to the timing of delivery to the equipment that you re making for the current aircraft and submarine schedules and what happened before versus what are the risks that something similar can happen again in 20 please for navy orders jim lines president and chief executive officer sure the primary risk around backlog conversion for our naval work is around new vessel program which is the design effort and going through the regulatory approval process to commence fabrication or the next stages of fabrication that can be an execution risk and that represents round numbers maybe half of our backlog business vessel program the more built to print work we re on repeat orders that has a more predictable flow of backlog conversion and then importantly as we look at the opportunities that are beginning to show up in the bid pipeline we do anticipate that there will be some sizable new orders that could come into our backlog across fiscal 20 tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you for that i think i saw it i think it was huntington recently started doing their cutting the steel for the first columbia class submarine correct me if i am wrong but have you given any context for potential margins on your navy work versus your other work i understand if you cannot jim lines president and chief executive officer no we really haven t at a quantitative level more directionally we have indicated that the naval work tends to carry a higher gross margin however will blend as the out margin satisfactorily but we ve not giving any specifics on that for competitive reasons and logical reasons tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you and the last one for me separately i see you retaining some of your power plant business i think it s remaining 11 of your power projects in backlog how is that different i mean besides being a different type of plant is it different types of equipment for different types of power plants or what are you retaining and why did you decide to retain that please jim lines president and chief executive officer sure our held for sale components of our backlog are related to the commercial nuclear utility market we also serve in the power market renewable cogeneration within renewable is geothermal waste energy that s the part of the power segment that we are retaining which has a different execution different sales model different quality programs than would the nuclear market sales tate sullivan maxim group analyst ok thank you very much have a good day jim lines president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities please proceed with your question bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst good morning jim and jeff jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning bill jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning bill bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst excuse me can we still work with the target gross margin looking out to kind of peak cycle in the 30 area is that still a reasonable expectation jim lines president and chief executive officer we have not moved off of that vision and that expectation what has to accompany that though bill just as a footnote or reminder is a stronger order environment that then enables a stronger pricing environment and that typically accompanies the gross margin list that then move out bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right right well based on your commentary things unfolded kind of as i expected 2020 21 that will be pretty good environment for new order growth do you think that environment will be sufficient to support the kind of gross margins that your expecting jim jim lines president and chief executive officer we are certainly more encouraged about the size of our bid pipeline our perceived timing of order placement and the quality of the work that we expect to win it s going to come down too i don t want to be evasive as we talked about over the in the past new capacity has a different margin profile than installed base work international refining work has a different margin profile than domestic refining work pet chem has lowe margin profile than refining work so there is a lot of variables at play but from our qualitative or directional perspective we are expecting that we should see improvement in gross margin after we get through 20 bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst very good on the navy bin as you indicated about half of your backlog was new vessels new capacity i didn t understand exactly where you indicated the other half m a from what kind of work jim lines president and chief executive officer i probably didn t speak very clearly the naval programs there are repeat builds for given vessel programs where the design is already set and then there is a new vessel program where they re building the first vessel and the new class of vessels so we have some work that s for the first vessel of a new class and that has a more labored and a more staged engineering execution time frame the built to print we call it that for description has a more orderly execution flow bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right ok now when you talk about potentially a meaningful pick up in your navy business in 2020 is that related to new vessels or a combination of new plus your repeatable type business jim lines president and chief executive officer that would be and just to qualify that that was on the order front that would be bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right so i am looking on the order front jim lines president and chief executive officer that would be for both surface ships and submarines principally surface ship bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst but would those be new designs or designs you ve already got on to box there jim lines president and chief executive officer they would be designs that we already have completed bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so it ll be your repeatable business then jim lines president and chief executive officer right bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst ok pretty good i know at one point in one of the previous conference calls you indicated that you are broadening out your exposure to potential navy markets is that what we are potentially looking at in 2020 and beyond some examples of that jim lines president and chief executive officer well we want to expand our supply within the programs that we are currently in organically and then we re also looking at how we can structure with m a to get more of the naval spend on the vessel programs or related programs that we are in so one is again doing actions and strategic initiatives to gain more of the spend for what we ordinarily can build and then secondarily because of the strength we see in the multi decade vessel program and the perception the navy has with our capabilities and the quality of our organization can we complement what we currently do with traditional product through an m a approach bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst ok well best of success with those programs and i guess just one follow up question does the sg a guidance that we re looking at does that have your all your increased personnel expenses included in it excuse me jim included in there or do you additional personnel that would be coming up in 2020 though show up in 2021 jim lines president and chief executive officer right the models that we ve given in the guidance reflects the appetite that we have for adding personnel in this current environment and the projected 21 22 environment so we ve incorporated that into our guidance bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so you re pretty well where you want to be then as far as personnel in that regard jeff glajch chief financial officer bill this is jeff just to interject the guidance that jim mentioned does have headcount in there what the guidance does not have is anything related to our commercial nuclear utility business so there will be some sg a that has impacted the company in previous year s financials which would not impact the company in fiscal year 2020 bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst so the 2020 guidance if i understand that does not includes sg a from energy steel jeff glajch chief financial officer correct jim lines president and chief executive officer right the 17 million to 18 million excludes the held for sale element of business bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst right just like the revenues exclude that business also jim lines president and chief executive officer and it incorporates our vision of adding personnel that go into the sg a cost centers so you shouldn t anticipate us to move above the 17 million to 18 million with the personnel adds that i cited it s already incorporated in that spend in the guidance bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst very good thank you very much jim lines president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from joe mondillo sidoti company please proceed with your question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst hi guys just a couple of follow up questions i m curious to speaking on energy steel if the divestiture would be accretive to gross margin and or earnings this year not sure if you want to talk about that or divulge that but i d be curious to know jim lines president and chief executive officer accretive to 2020 or accretive had it not been in 19 sorry what s the question joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst either way either way however you want to structure it jim lines president and chief executive officer should we be able to divest of energy steel it will be accretive to our margins on a look back basis joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then i also wanted to ask just on sort of cash question on your sort of your cash flow it seems like you may have the last couple of years you ve actually seen working capital as a source of cash with the ramp up in the navy work and maybe even in the petrochem are you anticipating any spend in cash for working capital and then i also wanted i was wondering what your capex budget will be this year jim lines president and chief executive officer joe this is jim we would not anticipate consumption of cash tied to our growth strategies as you might recall we do try to structure progress payments in a manner in which helps us fund procurement of long lead materials but we typically have had continual growth in balance sheet cash even while we ve grown it might be a quarter that has an odd use of cash but over an extended period of time we re not envisioning our operating model changing materially where we would consume cash as we grew and then on the capex side jeff you want to comment on that jeff glajch chief financial officer sure joe capex is targeted to be between 2 5 million and 2 8 million in fiscal 20 just following on jim s question if you would go back over the last decade you will see that our cash position pretty much increased most every year i think there was one year in there where we had and we call that out a very large customer deposit in one year and utilized it the next year but other than that our cash position is pretty continually increased whether we were in a good part of the market or weaker part of the market and as we are coming back into a little bit of a better part of the market we would expect cash flow to continue to be strong and cash position to continue to increase joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst right yeah i m not actually too concerned of that i was specifically asking more so on working capital how you see working capital turn last couple of years it has been a source of cash and i was just asking as you ramp up this navy your navy work and maybe some of the petrochem does working capital is that become a little more do you have to invest a little more in your working capital jeff glajch chief financial officer a little bit but to jim s point we try to tie our projects payments to the work that we are doing so and also as jim mentioned you will see quarters where we move but i think if you look over fiscal years we would not see a significant change in our working capital over any period of time jim lines president and chief executive officer and the phenomena that you saw the very typical phenomena and as we go into a downturn and then if you look at how graham comes out of a downturn into an expansion in our past again we haven t had material working capital changes but we would not anticipate that again joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then just lastly you sort of addressed it briefly just in terms of the cash position overall and potential sort of acquisition targets it sounds like i know you ve talked about in the past and just did recently targeting certain opportunities to take advantage of this naval build out but any other sort of commentary it has obviously been a while where we haven t seen much progress from the outside but i m sure there is some things going on internally not sure if you can provide any more color on sort of the m a opportunity jeff glajch chief financial officer joe yeah i understand it can be frustrating from the outside looking in that nothing has occurred but we have been very active over the past 18 months or so and continue to be very active in both the naval particularly the naval sector but also looking at some aftermarket opportunities in the commercial sector so we are very active we ve talked in the past year or two about opportunities that we are moving out and ultimately we peeled off on so again that could be frustrating from the outside but i assure you that the amount of effort that our business development team and myself and jim personally are spending is significantly greater today than it has been a couple of years back and we just needed to make sure we find that right fit for graham and move forward but right now we re very active it s just until something ultimately moves forward to closure it s hard to say much beyond that joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok understand thanks a lot appreciate it operator our next question comes from bill nicklin from circle n advisors please proceed with your question bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst good morning jim lines president and chief executive officer good morning bill jeff glajch chief financial officer good morning bill bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst good i ve got just one question if we look at the new politics of trade and consider let s say pet chem and refining what kind of changes might you expect and when and where and what configuration you re customers are going to be building in jim lines president and chief executive officer it s a good question complicated question our view is as the on pet chem the investments really relate to where is the lowest cost feed where is the low cost feedstock and right now that s north america and that s the middle east so we don t envision much change in where investments will accrue there around trade politics and in the international markets they still will add pet chem capacity for their growing and emerging economies again we don t see that dynamic changing materially and then on the refining front as we cited earlier india and china are ramping up for some very sizable new capacity adds i don t see global politics or trade modifying that as they invest to satisfy their local consumption they are not expert oriented nations the middle east of course is export oriented they will begin their next wave of refining investment we think in couple of more years so really bill on the overall my long winded response is i guess i don t feel as much change of foot for us bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst ok that s good i was just asking because you hear chatter all the time regarding particularly from the transportation companies that are looking about were petrochemicals are going to be sourced and where they re going to be delivered and are the roots going to change so china may say well we don t buy much or any ethylene from the u s it would seem to me that it would have an negative impact here but maybe a positive impact some place else where maybe raw material would be still sourced from north america but the chemical plants might be built some place else and therefore you could have a pickup in your business down the road jim lines president and chief executive officer sure that s all that s possible what we are identifying now is the as we said a moment ago it s really a race to where s the low cost feedstock and deciding the plants there and then the emerging economies trying to address local demand with local supply with new capacity there bill nicklin circle n advisors llc analyst all right very good thank you very much jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you bill operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i ll now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks jim lines president and chief executive officer thank you omar and thank you everyone for your questions this morning as we talked through our fourth quarter and the decision we made on energy steel we appreciate the depth of your questions and then your follow up questions and we look forward to updating you in august thank you operator duration

q a with b c liberal leader on unions pipelines and gasoline prices black press legislature reporter tom fletcher spoke with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson as a raucous spring session wrapped up with battles over labour and agriculture legislation he describes the outlook for the minority government and what he would do about gasoline prices tf you re leading the largest opposition ever in b c and you ve just finished the spring legislative session how would you rate your effectiveness as an opposition aw i think in the month of april we showed what we re made of because the ndp were on the ropes about mountain caribou about icbc about gasoline prices about their disgusting treatment of 17 000 women working in the social services sector and they ve felt the embarrassment and that s our job because we want to hold them to account tf we ve seen a few moves by the green party in the minority government are you resigned to the current government surviving to 2021 aw the routine in canada is that minority governments survive two to three years and we re coming up to the two year point with this ndp green coalition we saw the ndp were willing to try to force through labour legislation that was very one sided and the greens rebelled against that and voted with us on an amendment to stop this union raiding process on construction projects so we re starting to see things change with the greens and we re optimistic that there ll be an opportunity for the voters to express their preferences well before the fall of 2021 tf the target for raiding was clearly the independent unions and contractors that have taken up quite a lot of the construction market and what they ve told me is the ndp is doing the bidding of the b c building trades is that your take on it aw the ndp came to power in a world where 85 per cent of heavy construction is done by non union workers in non union companies they decided to push back on that and make it easier for unions to raid those organizations and try to organize them they ve been rebuffed somewhat and in response to that they ve put together their phoney community benefits agreements which are driving up the costs of construction to favour the small number of union contractors that they are beholden to so we re seeing a 32 per cent cost overrun on a two km section of highway in the rogers pass so you and i are going to pay an extra 20 million to get absolutely nothing more out of it tf there are a half dozen of those projects lined up are we going to see more of these kinds of cost overruns aw the concern is if they get into this 20 30 per cent cost overrun space on billion dollar projects that will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars of unnecessary spending to favour the union bosses that means no hospital in surrey no new hospital in richmond the ndp has to be honest about this tf another change is union successorship rights extended into private food services into janitorial services into bus transportation what s your take on that aw there s a place for organized labour and collective bargaining in our society it has shifted over the last 30 years and now we see a heavily unionized public sector and much reduced unionization in the private sector clearly what the ndp are trying to do is do their friends the union bosses some favours by opening up the option of easier labour certification and succession in the private sector whether that s viable in today s economy is a very valid question but they don t care they re going to force it through anyway related indigenous pipeline bidders await ottawa s decision related cost jumps 35 for trans canada widening in b c tf former tk emlups chief shane gottfriedson visited the legislature representing one of several indigenous groups bidding to take a controlling stake in the trans mountain pipeline do you think that s what will emerge aw all of us as federal taxpayers own a pipeline that we don t want and we don t know how to operate and the prospect of doubling the pipeline is something that i as a federal taxpayer have no interest in if other people want to come in as investors and take it over that s great and if they happen to be indigenous that s their decision the extra benefit is validating the position that there are tens of thousands of aboriginal people in b c and alberta who want to proceed with resource development and that needs to be more widely understood tf we ve heard a lot from you about gasoline prices in the last little while and some days it sounds to me like the b c liberals are campaigning against the carbon tax can you clarify that aw we re coming into a federal election where the carbon tax will be front and centre british columbia is in a good position under the b c liberal program that we control our own circumstances we ll find out after that federal election whether carbon taxes are going to be compulsory in canada or not and so we need to wait and see in terms of gas prices we have john horgan sitting on the highest gas prices ever recorded in north america and the highest taxes on gasoline ever recorded so those two aren t just a coincidence he has the choice to make gas cheaper in british columbia and he keeps coming up with one excuse after another that makes no sense at all he can do two things to reduce gas prices one is to reduce the taxes and the other is to make peace with alberta so we don t have a constrained supply from our major supplier why would he pick a fight with the people we need most tf what taxes would you cut the carbon tax aw the carbon tax needs to be basically frozen and the ndp plan to increase it again on july 1 we need to wait for the outcome of the federal election and see if it s going to be one imposed by the federal government or one where we control our circumstances the motor fuel tax is another big chunk of that taxation along with the translink taxes in the lower mainland and a smaller transportation tax here in victoria so there is room to move on taxation if john horgan wants to and he s pretending it s just not an issue and he s told his b c utilities commission investigators they re not allowed to talk about taxation because it s the obvious number one issue they should be address tf i still didn t catch which tax you would cut aw motor fuel tax should be capped when we see surges in gasoline prices to give british columbians a break tomfletcherbc tfletcher blackpress ca like us on facebook and follow us on twitter
an american economy and shopper already bracing for an escalation in the u s trade war with china was hit by an equally damaging blow this week when president donald trump unexpectedly ratcheted up his battle with mexico from produce to cars a wide variety of mexican goods could become more expensive if trump follows through on his threat to hit mexican imports with tariffs that soon could climb to 25 trump wants to pressure mexico into doing more to halt the flow of central american migrants to the u s via the mexican border the tariffs set to begin june 10 would gradually climb to 25 on oct 1 if mexico doesn t take steps to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of migrants trump said thursday such a strategy would hurt american shoppers the economy and stocks experts say just as u

peterson institute for international economics says that claim is dubious and almost certainly would be challenged in court even if the border crossings represent an emergency it s highly questionable that mexico could stop them he says a federal judge could order the tariffs removed while the case is hashed out in court bergsten says how much would prices go up a 5 tariff would likely be absorbed by retailers and manufacturers but much of a 25 tariff likely would be passed on to shoppers bergsten figures increasing costs by up 86 billion across the economy the trade partnership a research group thinks the overall total of tariffs will be less simply because u s retailers and manufacturers will buy less product from mexico because of the duties let s break it down how about car prices

1 300 per vehicle for the consumer i think initially it s a wait and see but it could become costly schuster said and car parts would be affected too so even holding on to an existing vehicle will become more expensive according to the center for automotive research where else could shoppers feel the impact one of the first places is the supermarket mexico sold u s grocers 26 2 billion worth of food in 2017 the produce section is especially vulnerable half of mexican food imports are fruits and vegetables produce has a shorter shelf life than items like beer so u s supermarkets will start paying them faster than products that may be sitting in a warehouse supermarkets may try to mitigate higher mexican imports by buying some imports from other countries but that s harder to do for some categories almost 95 of imported strawberries come from mexico supermarkets may also try to blunt the higher costs of some items by raising prices of higher volume staples that are less affected so even though 7 of banana imports come from mexico a grocer might raise those prices slightly to keep from raising avocado prices almost 90 of imports from mexico too sharply what else on store shelves

in terms of gas prices we have john horgan sitting on the highest gas prices ever recorded in north america and the highest taxes on gasoline ever recorded so those two aren t just a coincidence he has the choice to make gas cheaper in british columbia and he keeps coming up with one excuse after another that makes no sense at all he can do two things to reduce gas prices one is to reduce the

q a with b c liberal leader on unions pipelines and gasoline prices black press legislature reporter tom fletcher spoke with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson as a raucous spring session wrapped up with battles over labour and agriculture legislation he describes the outlook for the minority government and what he would do about gasoline prices tf you re leading the largest opposition ever in b c and you ve just finished the spring legislative session how would you rate your effectiveness as an opposition aw i think in the month of april we showed what we re made of because the ndp were on the ropes about mountain caribou about icbc about gasoline prices about their disgusting treatment of 17 000 women working in the social services sector and they ve felt the embarrassment and that s our job because we want to hold them to account tf we ve seen a few moves by the green party in the minority government are you resigned to the current government surviving to 2021 aw the routine in canada is that minority governments survive two to three years and we re coming up to the two year point with this ndp green coalition we saw the ndp were willing to try to force through labour legislation that was very one sided and the greens rebelled against that and voted with us on an amendment to stop this union raiding process on construction projects so we re starting to see things change with the greens and we re optimistic that there ll be an opportunity for the voters to express their preferences well before the fall of 2021 tf the target for raiding was clearly the independent unions and contractors that have taken up quite a lot of the construction market and what they ve told me is the ndp is doing the bidding of the b c building trades is that your take on it aw the ndp came to power in a world where 85 per cent of heavy construction is done by non union workers in non union companies they decided to push back on that and make it easier for unions to raid those organizations and try to organize them they ve been rebuffed somewhat and in response to that they ve put together their phoney community benefits agreements which are driving up the costs of construction to favour the small number of union contractors that they are beholden to so we re seeing a 32 per cent cost overrun on a two km section of highway in the rogers pass so you and i are going to pay an extra 20 million to get absolutely nothing more out of it tf there are a half dozen of those projects lined up are we going to see more of these kinds of cost overruns aw the concern

an american economy and shopper already bracing for an escalation in the u s trade war with china was hit by an equally damaging blow this week when president donald trump unexpectedly ratcheted up his battle with mexico from produce to cars a wide variety of mexican goods could become more expensive if trump follows through on his threat to hit mexican imports with tariffs that soon could climb to 25 trump wants to pressure mexico into doing more to halt the flow of central american migrants to the u s via the mexican border the tariffs set to begin june 10 would gradually climb to 25 on oct 1 if mexico doesn t take steps to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of migrants trump said thursday such a strategy would hurt american shoppers the economy and stocks experts say just as u s growth is slowing and the threat of more tariffs on chinese imports looms larger after the first 5 tariff in june tariffs would increase by 5 percentage points each month before reaching 25 on oct 1 mexican tariffs rattle stocks dow stocks end lower on threat of tariffs on mexican imports and recession fears pricey pickup 200 000 jeep gladiator based maximus is unveiled with only 24 to be built usa today economics reporter paul davidson breaks down the potential impact how much does the u s import from mexico mexico is the second largest exporter to the u s behind china shipping 346 5 billion in goods to the country in 2018 up 10 3 from 2017 top imports are vehicles machinery tvs furniture appliances and agricultural products such as avocados and other vegetables and beer and wine can trump legally use tariffs to prod mexico on immigration the international emergency economic powers act of 1977 does give the president the authority to impose tariffs in a national emergency trump has said he regards the influx of migrants through mexico as such a crisis using it to justify a shutdown of the mexican border earlier this year but fred bergsten co founding president of the peterson institute for international economics says that claim is dubious and almost certainly would be challenged in court even if the border crossings represent an emergency it s highly questionable that mexico could stop them he says a federal judge could order the tariffs removed while the case is hashed out in court bergsten says how much would prices go up a 5 tariff would likely be absorbed by retailers and manufacturers but much of a 25 tariff likely would be passed on to shoppers bergsten figures increasing costs by up 86 billion across the economy the trade partnership a research group thinks the overall total of tariffs will be less simply because u s retailers and manufacturers will buy less product from mexico because of the duties let s break it down how about car prices while a 5 tariff could have no effect prices could go up by several thousand dollars per model in the worst case scenario permanent 25 tariffs says jeff schuster president of global vehicle forecasting at lmc automotive for example a 30 000 vehicle imported from mexico would suddenly be hit with 7 500 in duties how much automakers pass on to car buyers depends on how long the tariffs last he says key models imported from mexico to the u s include for example the second and third most popular models in america fiat chrysler s ram pickup and gm s chevrolet silverado pickup automakers would want to avoid major spikes in individual models choosing instead to spread out the costs across their entire lineup all told deutsche bank projected an average price increase of about 1 300 per vehicle for the consumer i think initially it s a wait and see but it could become costly schuster said and car parts would be affected too so even holding on to an existing vehicle will become more expensive according to the center for automotive research where else could shoppers feel the impact one of the first places is the supermarket mexico sold u s grocers 26 2 billion worth of food in 2017 the produce section is especially vulnerable half of mexican food imports are fruits and vegetables produce has a shorter shelf life than items like beer so u s supermarkets will start paying them faster than products that may be sitting in a warehouse supermarkets may try to mitigate higher mexican imports by buying some imports from other countries but that s harder to do for some categories almost 95 of imported strawberries come from mexico supermarkets may also try to blunt the higher costs of some items by raising prices of higher volume staples that are less affected so even though 7 of banana imports come from mexico a grocer might raise those prices slightly to keep from raising avocado prices almost 90 of imports from mexico too sharply what else on store shelves beer mexico is a top exporter of beers thanks to the popularity of brands like corona modelo and dos equis the u s imported 3 2 billion worth of mexican beer in 2017 mexico also exported more than 1 3 billion in tequila and other liquors would this make my guacamole very expensive avocados imported from mexico have become a mainstay of the american diet for example of the 51 million pounds in the u s the week of may 19 almost 37 million came from mexico according to the most recent data from the marketing group avocados from mexico phil flynn senior market analyst at the price futures group in chicago said that while the proposed tariff is 5 shoppers would end up paying 10 more at stores and at least at the beginning california avocados could cover some of it home prices pricey homes in these 15 us cities put them at risk of a housing crisis hit to the wallet the expense nearly half of americans think can bankrupt them what would this mean for my summer picnic it depends on what you serve the u s imports plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables besides avocados including cucumbers berries tomatoes lemons and limes phil lempert founder of supermarketguru com which tracks industry news and trends says prices for all foods from mexico could catapult to more than 20 higher what we re going to see happen is mexico as we ve seen with china will find other partners to sell produce to beer to tequila to he said what i think will happen is that resource for us will dry up we ll have scarcity so prices will go much higher than 5 how about electronics a lot of parts come out of china but a lot of production and assembly go on at the mexican border says sage chandler vice president for international trade policy at the consumer technology association top consumer tech imports include desktop pcs and servers 24 3 billion in 2018 tvs 8 billion and refrigerators and freezers 3 8 billion the cta says chandler says there s a lot of confusion coming out of the white house would tariffs apply to products made in mexico that come into the u s or anything that ships from mexico regardless of its country of origin and some tariffs could be applied she says on multiple occasions as products or parts move back and forth across the border consumers are price sensitive when it comes to tech products and consumer electronics companies could even cancel planned back to school promotions or deals tied to amazon prime day says bernie thompson ceo of plugable a leading developer of docking stations and other computer peripherals how would tariffs affect mall purchases it s unclear which goods would see the biggest price hikes as retailers often shy away from sharing pricing strategies for specific items in advance however mexico s textile exports to the u s are sizable produce appliances and electronics and clothiers could be affected heavily if the tariffs were to occur according to daniel martins the founder of dm martins research what would the effect be on the u s economy a 25 tariff would reduce economic growth next year by seven tenths of a percentage point says economist greg daco of oxford economics it would mean 600 000 fewer jobs and that doesn t include the impact of the tariffs mexico would impose on u s exports in retaliation throw in that and proposed tariffs on another 300 billion in chinese imports later this year and the spreading trade war could tip the country into recession why did trump take this dramatic step besides pressuring mexico on illegal immigration goldman sachs says trump hopes the gambit prods congress into finally passing the united states mexico canada agreement known as the new nafta the administration earlier thursday submitted the text of the deal to congress launching a process for lawmakers to vote on it could the strategy work bergsten says it could work by forcing mexico to take more aggressive steps to curb immigration after all exports to the u s make up about 30 of the mexican economy according to oxford and 25 tariffs are likely to topple that country into recession it s not clear though how well mexico will respond to such a brass knuckled approach bergsten says meanwhile u s lawmakers have indicated the tariffs will only make them less likely to pass usmca it s very risky bergsten says it could blow up the whole trade agreement while burdening americans with higher prices how about stocks the dow jones industrial average fell 354 points friday or 1 4 as investors blindsided by the tariffs worried they could undercut the trade deal or even lead to a recession will mexico retaliate mexican officials said they will respond strongly so expect tariffs on virtually all u s goods exported to mexico if the u s hits mexico with a 25 duty u s exports to mexico totaled 265 billion last year among the leading products are machinery cars and plastics mexico is the nation s second largest market for agricultural products especially corn soybeans dairy and pork that would compound the struggles of american manufacturers and farmers already hobbled by china s tariffs contributing edward c baig dalvin brown and zlati meyer in new york nathan bomey in virginia and
