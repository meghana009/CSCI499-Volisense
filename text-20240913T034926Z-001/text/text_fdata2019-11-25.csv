crescat global macro fund letter to investors for the month of november 2019 titled the impending end of a mania an important ratio of commodity versus equity valuations just reached a fresh 50 year

it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q3 2019 hedge fund letters conferences and more macro imbalances there is a laundry list of dangerous assets bubbles in the global financial markets today that have built up over a record long us economic expansion highest ever global debt to gdp levels a passive investing and etf craze that has led to historic lofty us equity valuations across a composite of fundamental measures tracked by crescat impossibly valued currency and credit markets in china at an extreme for any large country relative to the size of its economy china s banking assets are valued at usd 41 trillion including substantial hidden non performing loans in our analysis a major mismatch compared to its much smaller and stumbling 13 6 trillion gdp economy record 17 trillion of negative yielding sovereign debt which may have just peaked in august 2019 private equity vc excesses in opaque assets highly leveraged companies and frequently unprofitable businesses masquerading as new economy disruptors record indebtedness of us public and private corporations combined relative to gdp crowded risk parity positioning among large hedge funds and institutions who are long stocks paired with leveraged long bonds a strategy that worked exceptionally well in a forty year backtest as well as the last ten years that it has become popular but it s a strategy that would likely get decimated in a rising inflation paradigm fashionable short volatility strategies which are yield enhancement strategies for an income starved world but the extra yield is earned in exchange for accepting asymmetric downside risk high valuations and crowding into sectors traditionally viewed as defensive including utilities reits and consumer staples with utilities being the most fundamentally questionable among them in our view and tech bubble 2 0 with extraordinary valuations in saas certain fang stocks many recent ipos catalysts the unwinding of these imbalances is likely to be highly destructive to the investment portfolios of unprepared global savers today below we list the confluence of macroeconomic timing signals including social and geopolitical forces now bearing down for an assault on overvalued financial assets most of these have been uncanny warning signs directly ahead of past bear markets and business cycle peaks in the us the treasury yield curve recently exceeded the critical 70 inversion threshold that has preceded each of the last six recessions with no false signals the conference board s consumer expectations survey has diverged strongly to the downside compared to its unsustainably high present situation index job openings are declining while the lagging and contrarian unemployment rate is at cyclical lows both the atlanta and new york fed s real time gdp trackers have been trending steadily down for almost two years and appear to be approaching recessionary levels corporate earnings of the russell 3000 already contracted on a year over year basis in the last reported quarter us share buybacks are now 30 lower than 2018 increased insider selling of stocks declining ceo cfo confidence surveys m a transactions drying up ism manufacturing pmi at recessionary levels construction spending declining bearish deteriorating stock market breadth while indices reach highs implied volatility for stocks retesting low levels that preceded previous selloffs smart money flow index diverging from the recent run up in the s p 500 leveraged loans stumbling busted delayed cancelled ipos recent liquidity crisis that spiked interest rates in the overnight us treasury rehypothecation market inflation rate above the entire treasury yield curve core and median cpi at 10 year highs diverging from long term inflation expectations at 40 year lows capacity utilization now falling commercial industrial loans declining the most since the housing bust auto loan spreads rising as delinquency rates rise net exports of services now falling the most since the gfc and tech bust increased election uncertainty and rising political polarization creates an unknown binary outcome for future tax policy which is now friendly for financial markets but could swing 180 degrees trump impeachment proceedings might impair his credibility in maintaining a hyped up economic narrative in face of deteriorating macro fundamentals and new bipartisan willingness to embrace fiscal stimulus and rising government deficits could change the inflation paradigm sooner rather than later and be detrimental to financial assets worldwide yield curve inversion with the us dollar as the world reserve currency versus an unprecedented 19 economies now with 30 year yields below usd libor overnight rates like the us hong kong canada and japan all recently breached critical 70 inversion levels within their own yield curves emerging market currencies have been falling despite recent easy fed policies indicating that dollar liquidity globally is still tight amidst record dollar denominated foreign debt ongoing trade and cold war between the world s two leading economies with diametrically opposed political systems each with its own historically extreme financial imbalances china yuan recently broke the key 7 level and looks poised for an accelerated devaluation that would almost certainly take global investors by surprise tariff increases that go into effect in december are a catalyst for an rmb shock if trade negotiations continue to stall which is our base case accelerated yuan depreciation is the rhino in the room that would be a likely contagious global risk off event feeding back to us european as well as other asian and emerging markets as we have seen on multiple occasions already since 2015 with only minor devaluations there have already been material disruptions in the global manufacturing supply chain due to the trade war frontloading of chinese semiconductor inventory and capex spending in 2019 amidst the threat of escalating us intellectual property purchase restrictions sets up earnings weakness ahead for this market leading but cyclically vulnerable industry the global manufacturing pmi has already dropped to recessionary levels multiple political and economic crises have already been erupting in emerging and frontier markets rising populism and nationalism more generally around the globe is causing disruption in world trade and financial markets and last but not least brexit the two closest analogs to today s excessive fundamental valuations for us stocks were the 2000 tech bubble and the culmination of the roaring twenties in 1929 our work suggests that today s valuations are even higher than those two periods the nifty fifty stock mania of 1972 is another comparable period that featured excessive valuations in a popular group of large cap growth stocks that became widely regarded as blue chip buy and hold positions institutions and retail investors were taught to cling to these stocks through thick and thin throwing fundamental analysis and valuation principles out the window the same idea is the prevalent passive investing dogma of today from today s valuations a mere cyclical mean reversion in stock market multiples implies a 50 drawdown in prices yet too many investors remain oblivious to these valuation risks many today have further been lulled into believing that central banks have their backs and will keep markets rising such bullish sentiment on the heels of recent fed liquidity injections has emboldened a late cycle speculative push higher in the indices even as the market internals have been noticeably deteriorating never mind that the last two fed easing cycles after tightening cycles coincided with and were confirmations of major bear markets and recessions underway rather than prevention of them a perfect predictor of recessions so far the recent distortions in the us treasury yield curve are among the most relevant macro indicators supporting crescat s bearish thesis and positioning today our comprehensive calculation shows that across all 44 spreads of the yield curve the percentage of them that are inverted spiked to 73 just three months ago in august this is a critical timing signal as we show in the chart below because in the five prior business cycle expansions that we studied we found that when 70 or more of the yield curve first inverts a recession soon follows in all but one case those recessions were accompanied bear market declines in stocks three of them were close to 50 collapses in the s p 500 index how to profit from yield curve inversions from a portfolio management perspective we have determined that buying gold and selling stocks is one of the most compelling macro investment ideas after inversions reach excessive levels since 1970 our analysis shows that when the yield curve first exceeds 70 inversions in a business cycle expansion the gold to s p 500 ratio performed exceptionally well on average in the following two years returning close to 90 while stocks lost almost 1 3 of their value on average the only time buying this ratio didn t work was during the s l crisis yet back then equity valuations were quite the opposite from today we think the 70 inversions that immediately preceded the 1973 4 inflationary recession and tech bust have the most comparable setups to today both of those times the numerator and denominator of this ratio worked extremely well for the ensuing 2 year period resulting in an average gain in the gold to s p 500 ratio of 147 excluding dividends the intriguing fact here is that the commodities to equity ratio was near historic lows at the peak of those two stock bubbles nifty fifty and tech as shown by the first chart in our letter above today s macro set up looks remarkably similar perhaps even more extreme gold is near record undervalued relative to the size of global monetary base and money supply at the same time equity valuations relative to their underlying fundamentals are arguably at their highest ever negative real rates across the whole treasury curve uber bullish for gold the entire treasury curve now yields less than core cpi it s the second time in history we have seen this the first being in early 2016 that time the fed had already hiked rates at the end of 2015 and was in quantitative tightening mode this time the fed has cut interest rates three times in three months and has returned to quantitative easing at an alarming 45 annualized rate with 15 trillion worth of sovereign bonds with negative yields and central banks easing globally we believe precious metals are in the early stages of a multi year bull market economy weakening as inflation rising when we look at the chain of events historically it s fed tightening late in the business cycle that leads to yield curve inversions and then recessions by the time the fed starts easing it s a confirmation that the downturn is ripe to unfold when such times have also coincided with stocks at record valuations severe equity bear markets have ensued today given the historic levels of debt and macro imbalances worldwide the next decline could easily be among the worst in us history given all the warning signs we think investors should prepare urgently if they have not already in our view a new wave of global fiat debasement policies is in its early stages and a shift in the inflation paradigm could be near to get a glimpse of this in the us note how the atlanta fed s gdp nowcast has been declining in the face of rising consumer prices this scenario could be extremely bullish for scarce and non dilutable forms of haven assets such as precious metals at crescat precious metals are overwhelmingly our preferred hedge against fiat money printing and over valued financial assets it s important to note that cryptocurrencies provide an additional outlet for investors to flee stocks and bonds as well as fiat currencies today and thereby to help make rising inflation in those currencies a self fulfilling prophecy bitcoin is a bet on technology and cryptography as well as a vehicle to disrupt and even circumvent government control over money bitcoin is limited in supply like precious metals and in that sense could be a valuable call option on inflation as the first mover it has the network effect advantage over other cryptocurrencies which are abundant and therefore unlike precious metals as an asset class we believe a small position in bitcoin could provide diversification and hedging with significant upside but we do not advocate for more than one or two percent of a portfolio at this time given its high risk for those living under authoritarian governments with strict capital controls it is important to note that cryptocurrencies provide a functional and disruptive means of escape which plays into our bearish view on the chinese yuan in the wake of the 2008 9 crisis central banks starved investors for yield in attempt to generate new borrowing and spending and thereby grow the economy but in the absence of significant fiscal stimulus to go along with it extraordinary monetary policy mainly served to generate extreme expansion in value of financial assets with only muted economic growth and real world inflation to go along with it monetary stimulus alone thus increased the wealth disparity between the rich who disproportionately own stocks and bonds compared to the more generally debt laden masses it is thus no surprise that today we have a fertile breeding ground for rising populism and nationalism and their financial bubble bursting implications including trade wars and deglobalization repo liquidity crisis a wake up call to china risks when today s plethora of macro imbalances begin to unwind we fully expect that fed intervention will again be necessary to attempt to ease the pain of collapsing asset prices the rehypothecation repo liquidity crisis that we just experienced in september is a new kind of wake up call like in 2008 a freeze up in the interbank credit markets is a sign that a large financial institution somewhere on the planet may be on the brink of collapse the fed indeed has already responded with emergency liquidity injections we can only imagine that a large and wobbling chinese bank needs us dollars and has been attempting to pledge treasuries to borrow them perhaps other banks stepped away for fear that those treasuries had already been pledged too many times over and nobody really knows who would get them if the music stopped we are not saying that is what happened in september we don t know what exactly happened the fed has been carefully guarding the true story but it has also continued in emergency qe mode for the last three months what we are saying is that there is indeed substantial financial market risk today because of the truly insane imbalances that have built up inside the chinese banking system based on our macro research we believe the pboc has already more than fully encumbered its foreign exchange reserves in its effort to keep its currency from collapsing to date the recent surprise new money printing from the fed is confirmation that there are indeed real problems beginning to surface in the global capital markets the fed s role to be clear if china s banking imbalances are indeed finally poised to unwind is not to rescue chinese banks rather to rescue the us banks that are their counterparties so while today s us stock market has many parallels to 1929 1972 and 2000 in terms of valuation and downside risk it also has some to parallels to 2008 with the potential for banking liquidity crises in the interbank dollar funding markets we are much less concerned about the risk of an actual collapse of the us banking system today because the fed has proven its willingness and ability to swiftly step in there ultimately we believe combined fiscal and monetary stimulus will be applied in concert to combat the next market and economic downturn we strongly believe that too many investors today are underestimating the future inflationary risk of this high likelihood the problem is the recency bias of the post gfc world where central bank easing failed to generate the inflation that was feared at that time the reason it didn t is that outside of china the accompanying fiscal expansion was absent the chessboard looks much different today the willingness to embrace new monetary and fiscal experiments today is high and they will come at a cost such a political climate is particularly troublesome for stock and bond bulls today because rising inflation would almost certainly be a killer of today s financial asset euphoria if one is going to buy stocks at all in this environment one area that looks extremely attractive with low valuations and improving fundamentals is gold and silver mining stocks many of these companies have low valuations improving growth and strong positive free cash flow already after going through a bear market from 2011 to early 2016 after four years of base building we believe they are poised to take off fundamentally and technically in a soon to be rising gold and silver price environment why crescat many investors are not even aware of the extreme valuations in the financial markets today at this likely critical macro inflection point in the global economy for those who are aware of these imbalances many are not willing to do very much about them in their portfolios for fear of going against the crowd for those who are willing to do something about it they may be inclined to move toward conventional defensive long positions and thereby may be crowding into a different kind of mania such as utility stocks which in reality have a horrific track record of protecting wealth during bear markets and recessions as we show below in the chart below going back to 1929 at crescat we believe have a better way of investing ahead of a probable downturn in the business cycle across multiple themes in our global macro hedge fund we are expressing what we believe is the macro trade of the century based on our three highest conviction themes long precious metals including mining stocks shorts select overvalued us and global equities and short the china yuan and hong kong dollar through asymmetric risk put options the truth is that not many professional money managers are willing to be significantly short stocks even most hedge funds tend to be net long funds and only rarely attempt to tactically time markets we are not perma bears by any means but are indeed attempting to tactically time the market today based on our macro models and themes given our strong views on the current unprecedented euphoria and abundance of catalysts for an imminent downturn our goal is to grow and protect wealth by capitalizing on it we are somewhat unique as a macro fund in that we believe in security selection in addition to broad macro trades for instance we prefer to pick individual equity longs and shorts based on our models to express our themes and generate outperformance alpha rather than just getting index beta exposure to express a macro trade we have demonstrated our ability to generate alpha in stocks over time in our large cap and long short strategies furthermore we are value investors which give us intrepid confidence to hold a portfolio that we believe is worth substantially more or less in the case of our shorts than the market is valuing it at any point in time within the context of our risk model we are willing to ride with the fluctuations in the market s pricing of our positions knowing that is what can also drive significant upside as the true value of our holdings ultimately becomes recognized thus we can be secure in maintaining our substantial us equity net short position today in each of our hedge funds at the same time as a frenzied wall street is trying to squeeze the last juice out of a record overvalued market historically late in the business cycle while oblivious to many of the risks that we see the performance in our hedge funds in q4 of last year and in may and august of this year which we show in the chart below is just a glimpse of what we believe we can achieve when the overall us stock market more fully transitions from bull to bear while we are having a slight pullback in november to date as the us market pushing marginally to new highs and precious metals are pulling back our us equity shorts have not been hurting us as much as one might think in our hedge funds because many of the stocks we are short have been declining us equity short positions in our maturing expansion theme made money for instance in both funds in september and october even as the overall indices pushed higher this is because the internals of the market have been weakening we think the market s diverging breadth is an important timing signal for the likely near term direction of the overall market which could begin to turn decisively down as soon as december given the holiday later this week investors will need to move on monday and tuesday if they want to add money to our hedge funds ahead of december we think it could be great timing october performance attribution october performance sincerely kevin c smith cfa chief investment officer tavi costa portfolio manager
by john mauldin nothing is forever not even debt every borrower eventually either repays what they owe or defaults lenders may or may not have remedies but one way or another the debt goes away one of western civilization s largest problems is we ve convinced ourselves debt can be permanent we don t use that specific word of course but it s what we do and is why government debt keeps rising we borrow faster than we repay previous borrowing and i mean governments everywhere china as well as the us our leaders have no real plan to reduce the debt much less eliminate it they just want to spend spend spend forevermore and most citizens are okay with that as i will note below the republican party i grew up with which back then seemed to constantly talk about deficits and debt is now comfortable with 5 and growing of gdp deficits as a result i think we will spend the latter part of the 2020s going through a kind of worldwide bankruptcy we won t call it that and it will take a lot of argument because we won t have a court to take charge but we will collectively realize the situation can t go on and find a way to end it i ve taken to calling this the great reset once the great reset is over we ll find a much better world waiting for us getting there will be the hard part debt monster in last week s slowing but not stopping yet letter we talked about the mounting signs of economic slowdown and possible recession falling freight volumes are particularly troubling my friend and economist peter boockvar wrote about the latest shipping data which came out this week the october cass freight index fell 5 9 y o y which is the 11th straight month of y o y declines cass freight repeated what they ve said for the past 5 months that the shipments index has gone from warning of a potential slowdown to signaling an economic contraction moreover several key modes and key segments of modes are suffering material increases in the rates of decline signaling the contraction is getting worse the underline is theirs not mine to continue the weakness in spot market pricing for many transportation services especially trucking along with recent airfreight and railroad volume trends heightens our concerns about the economy here are the 3 main areas of concerns 1 we are concerned about the increasingly severe declines in international airfreight volumes especially in asia and the ongoing swoon in railroad volumes especially in auto and building materials 2 we see the weakness in spot market pricing for transportation services especially in trucking as consistent with and a confirmation of the negative trend in the cass shipments index 3 as volumes of chemical shipments have lost momentum our concerns of the global slowdown spreading to the us increase the trade war looks as if it has reached a point of no return from an economic perspective as the rates of decline are accelerating again the underline is theirs but not all the news is bad and we could muddle along in this slow growth mode for a few more quarters or even years the problem is that even this mild growth is happening only due to monster amounts of debt a decade of bailouts qe zirp and so on encouraged everyone to lever up and they have ray dalio described this in his latest linkedin post because investors have so much money to invest and because of past success stories of stocks of revolutionary technology companies doing so well more companies than at any time since the dot com bubble don t have to make profits or even have clear paths to making profits to sell their stock because they can instead sell their dreams to those investors who are flush with money and borrowing power there is now so much money wanting to buy these dreams that in some cases venture capital investors are pushing money onto startups that don t want more money because they already have more than enough but the investors are threatening to harm these companies by providing enormous support to their startup competitors if they don t take the money this pushing of money onto investors is understandable because these investment managers especially venture capital and private equity investment managers now have large piles of committed and uninvested cash that they need to invest in order to meet their promises to their clients and collect their fees in other words much of what we see right now isn t real economic activity it is artificial incentivized by the monetary policies that ended the last crisis but should have stopped much sooner now people are beginning to see this emperor has no clothes the first evidence is in the failure to launch of unicorn companies like wework whose early investors assumed they could palm off their shares to unwitting ipo buyers nope didn t happen not going to but that s minor compared to the other threat they face rising interest rates in case you haven t noticed our negative rate loving overseas friends are having a change of heart the bank of japan and european central bank are plainly looking for an exit from nirp as their commercial banking sectors find it increasingly impossible to turn a profit and whatever many on the progressive left think about banks they are a critical part of the economy over here the federal reserve s rate cutting at the short end is raising rates at the long end and not coincidentally un inverting the yield curve by the way the yield curve almost always normalizes as recession begins so that is not an all clear signal this is happening in part because the fed is having to help the treasury sell enough t bills to cover the government s growing deficit this is helping reduce interest costs a bit because shortening the average maturity lets the treasury pay lower rates but it also leaves less capital at the long end pushing those rates higher and loan demand isn t shrinking because so many people figured they would keep refinancing forever this will change in due course and as we see debt laden businesses run into difficulty often because they were bad ideas in the first place bankers will tighten lending standards and the dominoes will start to fall recipe for conflict i realize some readers are of the progressive persuasion that debt doesn t matter we owe it to ourselves etc this is not correct debt does matter and there are limits to how much an economy can bear i ll admit the limit is proving higher than i thought but there is one and every day brings us closer to it you really need to watch this video of a recent conversation between ray dalio and paul tudor jones their part is about the first 40 minutes jones begins by positing that donald trump is the best salesman in american history because he a got the republican party to accept annual deficits at 5 of gdp and b convinced the fed to cut interest rates even with unemployment at 50 year lows of those two the budget deficit is the least surprising i sadly realized long ago that even republicans are fiscal conservatives only rhetorically and like all politicians will respond to constituent demands everybody wants lower taxes for themselves and higher spending on their own priorities that s what our system delivers not good but it s reality and so the debt grows ever larger we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us no candidate can run on anything close to fiscal balance because to do so would mean either advocating higher taxes or cutting entitlement programs both are guaranteed vote killers we learned this week that the federal deficit for the last 12 months rose above 1 trillion for the first time since 2013 the official on budget debt is only part of it too off budget will be at least another 200 billion with gdp weakening today the new york and atlanta fed models both cut their fourth quarter gdp growth projections to 0 4 or below and without a significant trade deal something more than just around the margins for optical reasons we can expect lower government revenues and higher government spending to further increase the deficit add in unfunded pension debt both at the federal level and lower does anyone really think that in a serious crisis washington won t bail out bankrupt state and local pension plans and of course it will step in to save the laughably unfunded pension benefit guaranty corporation which insures private defined benefit pensions all these unaccounted for liabilities will amplify future deficits at some point we are not going to get out of this debt trap by cutting benefits or raising taxes i agree with ray dalio that we are almost certainly going to monetize it i highly suggest that you read his latest piece titled the world has gone mad and the system is broken it is the shortest and best summary of his views that he has put out in a long time since there isn t enough money to fund these pension and healthcare obligations there will likely be an ugly battle to determine how much of the gap will be bridged by 1 cutting benefits 2 raising taxes and 3 printing money which would have to be done at the federal level and pass to those at the state level who need it this will exacerbate the wealth gap battle while none of these three paths are good printing money is the easiest path because it is the most hidden way of creating a wealth transfer and it tends to make asset prices rise after all debt and other financial obligations that are denominated in the amount of money owed only require the debtors to deliver money because there are no limitations made on the amounts of money that can be printed or the value of that money it is the easiest path note ray isn t saying he prefers this path or that it is a good choice he thinks it is what we will do i agree this is what will happen and it s going to have consequences the big risk of this path is that it threatens the viability of the three major world reserve currencies as viable store holds of wealth at the same time if policy makers can t monetize these obligations then the rich poor battle over how much expenses should be cut and how much taxes should be raised will be much worse as a result rich capitalists will increasingly move to places in which the wealth gaps and conflicts are less severe and government officials in those losing these big tax payers will increasingly try to find ways to trap them if that sounds like a recipe for conflict you re right it will probably get ugly we can t yet say exactly how because there are lots of ways this could unfold the fed has plenty of power already and congress can give it more the only real limit is what the markets will bear in terms of currency depreciation one way or another this will get to a great reset in which debt simply disappears that will inevitably create winners and losers some people who did everything right will get punished some irresponsible fools will get rewarded neither is good but that s not the point we are talking about what will happen not what we want currency wars in the video conversation mentioned above between paul tudor jones and ray dalio ray again highlights some problematic similarities between our times and the 1930s both feature a large wealth gap the absence of effective monetary policy a change in the world order in this case the rise of china and the potential for trade wars technology wars capital wars he threw in a few quick comments as their time was running out alluding to the potential for the end of the world reserve system and the collapse of fiat monetary regimes maybe it was in his rush to finish as their time is drawing to a close but it certainly sounded a more challenging tone than i have seen in his writings it brought to mind an essay i read last week from my favorite central banker former bis chief economist william white he was warning about potential currency wars aiming particularly at the us treasury s seeming desire for a weaker dollar ditto for other governments around the world he believes this a prescription for disaster one possibility is that it might lead to a disorderly end to the current dollar based regime which is already under strain for a variety of both economic and geopolitical reasons to destroy an old admittedly suboptimal regime without having prepared a replacement could prove very costly to trade and economic growth perhaps even worse conducting a currency war implies directing monetary policy to something other than domestic price stability there ceases to be a domestic anchor to constrain the expansion of central bank balance sheets should this lead to growing suspicion of all fiat currencies especially those issued by governments with large sovereign debts a sharp increase in inflationary expectations and interest rates might follow how this might interact with the record high debt ratios both public and private that we see in the world today is not hard to imagine i called bill to ask if he thought this was going to happen basically he said no but it shouldn t even be considered it was his gentlemanly way of issuing a warning currency devaluations against gold were part of the root cause of the great depression coupled with protectionism and tariffs they devastated global economic growth and trade do i think it will happen in any significant way in the next few years it is not my highest probability scenario but imagine a recession that brings the us deficit to 2 trillion possibly followed by a governmental change that raises taxes and spending this could bring about a second echo recession with even higher deficits this would force the federal reserve to monetize debt in order to keep interest rates from skyrocketing thereby weakening the dollar couple this with a concurrent crisis in europe potentially even a eurozone breakup resulting in countries all over the world trying to weaken their currencies with the potential for higher inflation in many places in such a scenario is it hard to imagine a desperate president and congress toward the latter part of the next decade regardless of which party in control instructing the us treasury to use its tools to weaken the dollar can you say beggar thy neighbor can you see other countries following that path all as debt is increasing with no realistic exit strategy except to monetize it timing is everything as bill and i talked scenarios he reminded me of herbert stein s dictum if something can t go on forever it won t but then he quoted another famous economist whose name escapes me who replied but it can go on a lot longer than you think kind of like keynes reminding us that the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent the world has grown accustomed to having the dollar as reserve currency it is comfortable letting central banks monetize debt and governments run ever larger deficits somehow we ve even become used to negative rates things can indeed go on longer than one might think i can seriously imagine the market rising significantly over the next few quarters as easily as i can imagine a bear market but it will be a few years before the gut wrenching great reset happens we have time if we properly use it to position our lives and help those around us prepare for the coming storm we will have the chance to invest in new companies that will absolutely astoundingly change the world for the better they re going to be extraordinarily valuable franchises there will be fixed income opportunities even as interest rates drop i almost find it ironic that on the one hand i talk about the great reset while i am writing a book called the age of transformation marveling at all of the wonderful new opportunities we will have learn to deal with change and take advantage of it oh yeah and consider slowly increasing your allocation to physical gold i don t think of gold as an investment i think of it as central bank insurance and after meditating on today s letter i think i may need a little more insurance just a thought

intellectual property it is also into lowering thresholds for criminal punishments for such violations and making it easier for the victims to receive compensation on the surface this may look like a concession to the us which has been pressing hard for greater protection is intellectual property rights yet the problem is often not that china has the wrong laws but that the laws are not enforced the contradiction is between the declaratory policy what it says and operational policy what it does hong kong s pro democracy forces scored a stunning victory in yesterday s election it appears to have won about 85 of the 452 seats that were contested compared with about a quarter in the last election in 2015 there was a recover voter turnover nearly twice the 2015 turnout while this is clearly a rebuke of the hk government and china the district council seats are not sufficient in themselves to enact fundamental change it nevertheless lays the foundation for next year s legislative council

the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 and the rise of the high speed internet have proved to be the economic and political undoing of the west the end of history caused socialist india and communist china to join the winning side and to open their economies and underutilized labor forces to western capital and technology pushed by wall street and large retailers such as wal mart american corporations began offshoring the production of goods and services for their domestic markets americans ceased to be employed in the manufacture of goods that they consume as corporate executives maximized shareholder earnings and their performance bonuses by substituting cheaper foreign labor for american labor many american professional occupations such as software engineering and information technology also declined as corporations moved this work abroad and brought in foreigners at lower renumeration for many of the jobs that remained domestically design and research jobs followed manufacturing abroad and employment in middle class professional occupations ceased to grow by taking the lead in offshoring production for domestic markets united states corporations force the same practice on europe the demise of first world employment and of third world agricultural communities which are supplanted by large scale monoculture is known as globalism as world bank and imf study reports revealed for most americans income has stagnated and declined for the past two decades much of what americans lost in wages and salaries as their jobs were moved offshore came back to shareholders and executives in the form of capital gains and performance bonuses from the higher profits that flowed from lower foreign labor costs the distribution of income worsened dramatically with the mega rich capturing the gains while the middle class ladders of upward mobility were dismantled university graduates unable to find employment returned to live with their parents american economic analysts stressed that the absence of growth in real consumer incomes resulted in the united states federal reserve expanding credit in order to keep consumer demand growing the growth of consumer debt was substituted for the missing growth in consumer income the united states federal reserve s policy of extremely low interest rates fueled a real estate boom housing prices rose dramatically permitting homeowners to monetize the rising equity in their homes by refinancing their mortgages according to american economic analysts consumers kept the economy alive by assuming larger mortgages and spending the equity in their homes and by accumulating large credit card balances the explosion of debt was securitized given fraudulent investment grade ratings and sold to unsuspecting investors at home and abroad wall street journal reported that financial deregulation which began in the years of president bill clinton and leaped forward in the regime of president george w bush unleashed greed and debt leverage brooksley born head of the federal commodity futures trading commission was prevented from regulating over the counter derivatives by the chairman of the federal reserve the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the securities and exchange commission the financial stability of the world was sacrificed to the ideology of these three stooges that markets are self regulating insurance companies sold credit default swaps against junk financial instruments without establishing reserves and financial institutions leveraged every dollar of equity with 30 dollars of debt when the bubble burst the former bankers running the united states treasury provided massive bailouts at taxpayer expense for the irresponsible gambles made by banks that they formerly headed the federal reserve joined the rescue operation an audit of the federal reserve released in july 2011 revealed that the federal reserve had provided 16 trillion dollar a sum larger than united states gdp or the united states public debt in secret loans to bail out american and foreign banks while doing nothing to aid the millions of american families being foreclosed out of their homes political accountability disappeared as all public assistance was directed to the mega rich whose greed had produced the financial crisis the financial crisis and plight of the banksters took center stage and prevented recognition that the crisis sprang not only from the financial deregulation but also from the expansion of debt that was used to substitute for the lack of growth in consumer income as more and more jobs were offshored americans were deprived of incomes from employment to maintain their consumption americans went deeper into debt the fact that millions of jobs have been moved offshore is the reason why the most expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in the united states history have had no success in reducing the unemployment rate in post world war ii 20th century recessions laid off workers were called back to work as expansionary monetary and fiscal policies stimulated consumer demand however 21st century unemployment is different the jobs have been moved abroad and no longer exist therefore workers cannot be called back to factories and to professional service jobs that have been moved abroad economists have failed to recognize the threat that jobs offshoring poses to economies and to economic theory itself because economists confuse offshoring with free trade which they believe is mutually beneficial dr john dalton of leeds

by joe macaron it has been over a month since the lebanese uprising began and there are no indications that the country s ruling oligarchy is willing or ready to offer concrete concessions in giving up power the political class seems united in buying time to weather the storm of public anger while seeking to disperse and divide the protesters and undermine their cause lebanon is on the verge of economic collapse with no end in sight to the crisis of public confidence in the country s current political system what has been fascinating about these unprecedented developments in lebanon is the cross sectarian unity among both the protesters and the political class protesters have been demonstrating in squares from the north to the south of the country while coordinating their actions via whatsapp this remarkable civic awareness is heralding a new sense of belonging where citizens feel they have a stake in governance without going through the leading oligarch of their sectarian community the protests in both rural and urban areas have yet to convert this newfound collective power into a political platform and policy making process only in the past decade has lebanon begun to witness new civil society movements and political parties seeking to provide an alternative to the traditional ones but there is still a long way to go lebanon needs a major constitutional and economic overhaul a task that cannot be accomplished overnight moreover the members of lebanon s ruling oligarchy are clinging to each other and employing almost uniform tactics to quell the popular uprising so far there were multiple speeches by president michel aoun prime minister saad hariri who resigned on october 29 but is now heading a caretaker cabinet and hezbollah secretary general hassan nasrallah these speeches varied from embracing and acknowledging the demands of the protesters to condemning their behavior and insinuating they are receiving foreign support every speech by one of the oligarchs seems to incentivize the protesters to return to the streets while every move by the protesters seems to unite the political class to sway the general public in their favor the ruling class and their affiliates are warning of economic collapse and security deterioration if the protests continue the lack of regret regarding their failures or empathy toward the protesters demands speaks volumes about how much the political class is disconnected from or unconcerned about the magnitude of these protests there are three crucial dynamics that will decide how this ongoing crisis will unfold security politics and the judiciary and the economy the security environment while the lebanese military remains generally neutral and the interior ministry s security forces have been largely idle during this uprising paramilitary forces and gangs officially and non officially affiliated with the ruling political parties have seldom assaulted the protesters the lebanese army s military intelligence which is traditionally linked to the president1 and is now headed by brigadier general tony mansour has arrested and used force against protesters in recent weeks the republican guard brigade also under president aoun s control was deployed to deter the protesters march on the road leading to the presidential palace in baabda on november 12 a bodyguard for the military intelligence bureau chief colonel nidal daou who is reportedly close2 to the progressive socialist party leader walid joumblatt shot and killed the protester alaa abou fakher in khaldeh located near the highway connecting beirut to south lebanon on november 13 a gunman opened fire on protesters in jal el dib in the mount lebanon province previously supporters of hezbollah and the amal movement assaulted protesters in downtown beirut and broke their tents all these coercive attempts however did not dissuade the protesters from continuing their actions the sticking point among the lebanese public has been the road blockades by protesters whether this is part of civil disobedience or a violation of the basic right of citizens to move since these demonstrations succeeded in forcing hariri s resignation the protesters case for blockading the roads was weakened after these chaotic couple of weeks the commander of the lebanese military general joseph aoun defended the army s posture during the protests and set the tone for the coming period saying that the army would continue to secure the safety of protesters but that it would no longer accept the blockading of roads this stance by the army means the current impasse might be reinforced with the political class under no significant pressure to compromise and the protesters under no pressure to leave the squares where they have been demonstrating across the country political and judiciary dynamics the dynamics of lebanese politics have significantly shifted since the start of the uprising in october 2019 the 2016 presidential deal between aoun and hariri has fizzled under public pressure but has not yet fallen apart in general terms the deal allowed for the election of michel aoun as president on october 31 2016 following more than two years of a presidential vacuum in exchange for hariri becoming prime minister hezbollah which is president aoun s political ally pushed for and approved the arrangement hariri is deflecting the blame to aoun s son in law foreign minister gebran bassil considered the real deal maker in the president s camp who in return is pointing a finger at hariri for the government s failure to combat corruption instead of heeding protesters demands the oligarchs sought to reach a deal behind closed doors on the formation of a new cabinet hariri who resigned but seems to be eager to return to power is putting his own preconditions on leading a purely technocratic cabinet however aoun and hezbollah do not want hariri alone to have a free hand in a cabinet of technocrats they are insisting on a mixture of technocrats and politicians whose names would not provoke a negative reaction from protesters the name of former minister mohammad safadi was floated as a potential premier but this seemed to be primarily a political maneuver that was denounced by the protesters which led to safadi s withdrawal from consideration safadi who is close to both hariri and bassil was meant to be a compromise that would keep the 2016 presidential deal alive while hariri s departure gave the impression that he resigned in defiance of hezbollah and bassil the parties of this deal aoun hariri and hezbollah seem to be invested in continuing to negotiate a new version of their power sharing formula hariri will lose what is left of his political capital if he is out of power or if he is not at least the kingmaker of the new cabinet while aoun and hezbollah need the international community s support so that hariri can navigate the current economic crisis and avoid further us sanctions the challenge however is that reaching a deal among the ruling political class is no longer sufficient since whatever they agree on must meet the high bar of the leaderless uprising protesters have recently been buoyed by the election of one of their supporters independent melhem khalaf as head of the influential beirut bar association they also succeeded in preventing the parliament on november 19 from holding a session to pass controversial bills behind closed doors and before the formation of a cabinet that meets the protesters demands however the protests are yet to achieve their goal of holding corrupt officials accountable in the courts while the state financial prosecutor ali ibrahim has ordered some officials to appear for an informal investigation no official has yet been prosecuted nor has stolen money been returned as protesters are demanding moreover the aoun hariri friction was reflected in the judiciary that largely remains under the control of the political class when mount lebanon prosecutor ghada aoun who is close to the president charged hariri s ally former prime minister najib miqati for making unlawful profits through subsidiary housing loans a week later state prosecutor ghassan oueidat who is close to hariri initiated disciplinary action against judge aoun and asked security agencies not to send her new cases unless there are fresh appointments of apolitical judges the potential of accountability and reform remains limited the economic factor perhaps the most pressing situation is the looming risk of economic collapse with growing signs in both the private and public sectors lebanon has one of the highest debt burdens in the world projected to reach 155 percent of gross domestic product by the end of this year in addition the country s local currency has weakened against the dollar by about 20 percent on the black market lebanon s central bank is gradually losing foreign currency reserves and the banking system is imposing a de facto capital control to block the potential flight of foreign currency in fact citizens access to their funds in the commercial banks is now limited to 1 000 per week the commercial banks closed for long stretches since the protests began on october 17 on november 19 they reopened again after they were provided government security protection around their branches which is an additional public cost it is noteworthy that even during the civil war lebanese banks did not close for such an extended period these institutions which primarily own lebanon s overall national debt are concerned about potential activities by protesters hence they asked and were granted security protection from the caretaker government meanwhile lebanon s central bank is still excluding any change in the country s 22 year peg which fixes the lebanese pound at 1 507 5 to the dollar asserting this move is crucial to stabilize the monetary crisis however the devaluation of the lebanese pound might be inevitable since the black market is already doing so and this will negatively impact the savings of a large segment of the population most notably retirement funds there might not be enough dollars in the lebanese market to match the public demand for them if the political crisis persists and the country continues to be largely paralyzed there might be an eventual economic collapse including the state s inability to pay wages containing the situation might need a default at some point and a bailout by monetary institutions like the international monetary fund the suggested solution by protesters is that the wealthy who have benefited from the political system should pay the national debt either through a fair tax system or by returning stolen money this mechanism is not in place and might not materialize given the current dynamics therefore there are open questions about whether a social safety net could mitigate the impact of the economic collapse and about who will end up paying for these social measures with a looming economic collapse and a deep political crisis lebanon requires an urgent implementation of genuine reforms and a fundamental shift in governance these two preconditions are nonexistent at present the ruling political class is settling scores and continuing business as usual while protesters are unable to shift the paradigm of power without having significant influence in the government or holding an early parliamentary election both these objectives are unattainable in the foreseeable future given the stated positions of the ruling political class meanwhile us policy in lebanon remains ambiguous ranging from withholding assistance to the lebanese military to focusing statements on hezbollah rather than on the larger context of the lebanese crisis the trump administration s public rhetoric is typically counterproductive for protesters as recent events have shown given ongoing attempts in lebanon to portray the protests as a us funded plot what washington can do is to have the us embassy in lebanon privately urge all lebanese officials to acknowledge the gravity of the current crisis and heed the voices of protesters while encouraging the military to remain neutral beyond that the trump administration could potentially aggravate an already protracted political crisis joe macaron is a resident fellow

atlanta fed issues a new q4 forecast on wednesday it was a lousy 0 4 last time nov 19th for financial markets trump s state of mind amid the impeachment inquiry and trial is of high importance especially the china deal but also nafta 2 0 we are now betting both deals can get done before year end not because they should get done in their present form but because trump wants something to boast about over the christmas and new year holidays we smell a capitulation in the white house over the dec 15 tariffs trump can postpone them for the sake of the deal imposing them would harm christmas shopping so that not imposing them looks like a gift to the public while he can always re impose them later if we get trade deals however bad we have to ask whether the reduction in uncertainty is dollar unfavorable we as just saw over the past few weeks relief fails to drive it down by much or for long and the stock market will like a double trade deal as we know for mysterious reasons the dollar tends to trade inversely to the major equity indices if they go up the dollar tends to soften this is food for thought not a forecast and we can easily be treated to both the stock market and the dollar continuing to rise at the same time not only on existing momentum but because once again we see that toxic politics can co exist with a decent economy and the good economic data point to a lower probability of a fed rate cut in the first half of 2020 on friday the cme had a 33 8 probability of one hike by the june 10 fomc it has been 40 6 a month ago adding up all the cuts that might come friday had a 42 8 probability from 45 5 a month ago this looks like a smallish move but consider that in october 3 6 foresaw cuts all the way to 0 50 1 now that extreme viewpoint is reduced to only 0 9 non dovish feds are starting to look more prescient ny fed chief williams persists in saying the us economy is in a good place boston chief rosengren never wanted any cuts because they weaken the toolkit when a true recession comes along and we all know what minneapolis kashkari prefers a key issue is whether the yield curve stays normal and the 2 10 spread widens as many observers note the spread is skinny and fragile it moved wider from 0 04 on 8 27 to 25 on nov 13 but was down to 17 points last thursday see the st louis fed version of the spreads we want to see the 10 year rise back up toward 2 and widen that spread and at the same time we want to see the cme s probability numbers betting on more rate cuts keep falling those two things together suggest a super strong dollar so we have trade deals we have really quite good economic data not only about the consumer but also factory managers we have a fed that can fend off calls for more rate cuts by saying we are all right jack we have possibly the normalization of the yield curve and gains at the long end despite no real inflation anywhere in sight a goldilocks outcome we have rising stock markets he who shorts the dollar for the next week does so at his peril fun tidbit bloomberg has a cute story on the swiss franc gaining an average of 3 against the yen in the last 6 weeks of the year in most of the last 20 years it helps if global stocks are rallying conditions are always somewhat different of course and swapping one haven for another could hardly be called a risk on move politics cnn analyst smerconish holds a live survey every saturday morning on one topic this time it was whether trump should be censured rather than impeached since the senate will not remove him and he can go on to brag about being found innocent by a vast majority almost 15 000 persons the answer was no censure is too wussy and fails to impart the severe disapproval we feel against someone who thinks he is above the law and disregards the constitution impeach full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes the problem is that while the smerconish audience is more mixed as to party than most commentators the viewers who are motivated to take the online survey might well be all dems with perhaps a smattering of those silent republicans on the sunday talk shows our favorite talker zakaria says trump s policies of unilateralism and isolationism are pulling the us back from the world and undermining the global order these policies include demanding larger payments from allies south korea and japan for housing us troops ceding middle east policy to strongmen in turkey and saudi arabia withdrawing from the un human rights council approving of israeli settlements and undermining the us commitment to defend nato allies in europe though impeachment dominates headlines the trump administration has become the biggest threat to the international order by weakening the alliances and rejecting the rules and norms that have upheld it we have yet to hear of a single republican let alone a cadre who will stand up for truth and dignity eight of them including potential rebels romney and collins went to lunch at the white house on friday this is trump engaged in jury tampering before the trial every once in a while a lone voice can be heard crying in the wilderness we want out party back the republican party that is trump has hijacked it and hacked it to shreds yes the tax cut and de regulation are in keeping with principles but that s all not telling lies all the time not insulting women and civil servants nwe have yet to hear of a single republican let alone a cadre who will stand up for truth and dignity eight of them including potential rebels romney and collins went to lunch at the white house on friday this is trump engaged in jury tampering before the trial ot building the national credit card debt to dizzying heights not extorting an ally at war with 400 million in military aid for a personal political advantage not rejecting free trade and global leadership reagan said tear down this wall and americans remain proud of that quick name one thing trump has ever said of which we can be proud we can understand the voters who choose disruption of the establishment but the price has already risen too high to those who want not only impeachment but removal alas recent polls show the same ratio of always trumpers opposing impeachment the same ratio of dems supporting it and independents losing interest and support for impeachment bottom line it looks like the impeachment story will end with a whimper and not a bang what seems glaringly and overwhelmingly obvious to many including nearly all the press is just a burp to trump supporters tis sad putin wins note to readers this

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com the outlook for the world and european economies has worsened over the last few months world trade remains in the doldrums industrial production is declining year on year in a large number of countries and geo political uncertainties are mounting a recession in the industrialized countries is possible though not yet inevitable forecast growth rates for 2020 and 2021 have in any case been reduced especially in europe growth remains relatively solid in the world s two largest economies but alarm signals are appearing despite a relaxation in monetary policy china is still going through a soft patch both investment and exports are subdued and even private consumption the main engine of recent growth appears to be slowing down trump s protectionist moves and threats are clearly taking their toll on the economy there may be occasional truces in the united states trade war but the uncertainty that trump has created weighs on expectations and hence on growth in the u s the labour market and some confidence indicators remain relatively strong suggesting that moderate growth should continue despite industrial weaknesses induced by low exports and investment fears of a recession hinge on the inversion of the so called yield curve denoting an unusual situation in which short term interest rates are below long term ones in the past this has been an almost infallible sign of an impending downturn in activity yet the signal may be blurred on this occasion there has been a global flight to safety which has pushed down returns on safe assets such as u s treasury bonds in addition yields may also have come down because of mounting expectations of lower longer run growth or secular stagnation in these circumstances recession may not be as inevitable as some observers think a slowdown to gdp growth rates not much above 1½ percent per annum however seems unavoidable the picture in emerging markets is mixed but recent trends suggest that a number of countries are experiencing difficulties this is particularly true in east asia because of the sharp slowdown in the growth of world trade in latin america argentina is again in the throes of crisis while brazil and mexico have to cope with new and inexperienced presidents in both countries growth has been almost flat this year as for venezuela the economy seems now to be in virtual free fall the european situation has worsened over the summer the continent s biggest economy germany is on the verge of recession with its industrial output declining now for more than a year despite calls from numerous quarters to use fiscal policy to boost demand the country s government still shows reluctance the italian situation is not much better the change in government has produced a very welcome and hefty reduction in the interest rate spread between germany and italy but this is unlikely on its own to spur a near lethargic domestic economy while france and spain are in a somewhat better position eurozone growth is very unlikely to be much above 1 percent both this year and next in addition the threat of a so called hard brexit looms an agreement between the uk and the eu is still possible between now and the end of october but its chances are diminishing rapidly should it not be forthcoming there will be economic costs for everyone oxford economics estimates for instance that british gdp rather than growing by 1 percent in 2020 and 2 percent in 2021 would marginally decline next year and rise by only 1½ percent in 2021 ireland would also see its growth curtailed by 1¼ percentage points of gdp over the two years elsewhere the losses would be smaller but all the four major continental countries would lose at least 0 25 percent of their gdp in 2020 a recession in the eurozone might be avoided even in the case of a hard brexit but this outcome assumes that no other negative shocks would occur unfortunately such shocks are possible two dangers in particular have emerged in the recent past the world trade organization has authorized the u s to levy tariffs on european exports in retaliation for its subsidies to airbus in addition trump keeps threatening europe with further trade duties his latest targets are cars mainly german and wine mainly french should he go ahead and should europe retaliate as it has promised to do a fully fledged trade war would seem inevitable rough estimates suggest that such an outcome would reduce growth in the euro area by ½ a percent in 2020 and by a full 1 percent in 2021 in addition oil prices may also rise as they did recently albeit only temporarily in the wake of continuing turmoil in the middle east should a hard brexit combine with trump s various tariffs and an oil shock a recession would be inevitable it might only be shallow unlike 2009 but it could be protracted economic policy would in such a case try to sustain activity but there are limits to its effectiveness monetary policy has been further relaxed by the european central bank ecb at its last september meeting short term interest rates are now projected to remain negative until at least the end of 2021 yet the power such low rates have to stimulate growth has diminished through time mario draghi the ecb s president has acknowledged this and has called on europe s governments to do more on the fiscal policy front unfortunately there is little consensus on this issue france italy and spain would almost certainly like to relax their fiscal stance but all three are constrained by the eurozone s fiscal rules germany which is not so constrained is much more hesitant attitudes may change of course the netherlands for instance is now planning to cut taxation and raise public investment expenditure despite its reputation as a country committed to austerity and the new british government seems also willing to let its budget deficit rise but a strong pan european response still remains highly unlikely hopefully not all shocks will materialize at least not simultaneously but prospects both for the short and the medium run remain very subdued even if growth does not turn negative in 2020 21 the medium term european outlook is for at best only very modest growth rates of output stagnation or recession pdf 0 6 mb the content of this article is

the federal deficit used to expand as the whole of the us economy was getting worse and shrink as the economy grew stronger but that s no longer the case despite the relatively strong economy the federal deficit is growing and that appears to be in response to the weakening manufacturing sector the focus on manufacturing seems to be driven by the outsized political influence of the industry causing politicians to focus on boosting the sector george pearkes is the global macro strategist for bespoke investment group visit business insider s homepage for more stories new look sign up to

go download the app email address sign up by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time advertisement the recent surge in federal budget deficits has caused a lot of hand wringing among federal debt worriers but little action among lawmakers the sudden jump in deficits despite a relatively strong us economy appears to represent a serious political economy shift instead of increasing fiscal stimulus as a response to a broad slowdown in the us economy the deficit increase appears to be targeting recent softness in the manufacturing sector policymakers possibly due to the outsized political influence of the sector have gone from ignoring pain in manufacturing to over compensating for it the deficit used to mirror the strength of the economy as a whole from the late 1960s through the early 2010s it was pretty easy to predict where the federal budget deficit would be based on the performance of the broad economy during periods of economic strength stronger tax receipts meant smaller deficits while policy responses such as stimulus programs kicked in during weaker periods and raised federal spending as tax collections fell advertisement a broad economic variable like the unemployment rate for americans in their prime working years was a clear explanation of how big the deficit would run relative to the economy the chart below is clear this was a very stable relationship george pearkes put another way the deficit was primarily responsive to the strength of the whole economy not just one sector more recently things look very different in part because the macroeconomic drivers of lawmakers incentives have shifted but now the growing deficit seems tied to weak manufacturing the mechanics of higher deficits in recent years are broadly familiar and uncontroversial advertisement the first jump came from weaker corporate tax revenues in 2015 and 2016 thanks to a strengthening us dollar and lower oil prices this was followed by the tax cuts and jobs act the republican supported corporate income and personal tax cut that reduced federal revenues relative to previous projections looking at the struggles of the industrial sector there are ways to argue that the recent fiscal stimulus through deficit expansion makes sense for one thing factory output plunged as global growth a sagging energy industry and a strong us dollar weighed on the sector during the mid 2010s and output has since slowed again amid a fresh slowdown in global demand related stories as a result federal reserve estimates of the spare capacity in aggregate across utilities manufacturing and mining including oil extraction are much weaker today than they were during other economic expansions this measure tries to capture what percentage of existing production capacity is being used for example a factory that adds a night shift is operating at a higher capacity utilization than it was previously advertisement george pearkes the deficit is still wider than industrial capacity utilization would predict but on first glance deficits around 5 of gdp would be plausible based on what we know about the manufacturing sector alone it s important to remember that manufacturing accounts for just 8 5 of total employment a record low versus about one third of the workforce in the 1950s notably manufacturing has gone from adding about one quarter of output in the 1950s to 11 today a less dramatic decline that has been helped by higher productivity so the question becomes why did lawmakers suddenly start focusing on the manufacturing sector over the overall economy the politics of manufacturing are driving the deficit what looks to be happening is a shift in political economy advertisement during the late 1990s and early 2000s the industrial sector was badly hurt by a range of factors economic cycles competition from foreign imports and higher productivity squeezing less efficient producers but other sectors were able to step up and cover the lost of employment output losses were more modest than employment losses thanks to higher productivity overall if the industrial sector had been the only sector of the economy then it would have made sense to run substantial deficits over the 1996 2002 period reduce slack but instead federal surpluses roared to over 4 of gdp during the heart of that period now it appears policymakers are more sensitive to the concerns of the industrial sector this could be because of the outsized importance of historically manufacturing centric states like pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin in 2016 just 110 000 votes spread across those states secured president donald trump s electoral college victory given those states political importance and industrial make up it s not a surprise to see more focus on manufacturing s concerns additionally close association between the republican party and the mining sector especially oil gas and coal are another reason to explain why a gop controlled congress for 2016 2018 and white house might be willing to run bigger deficits than might be indicated by other economic variables advertisement is the deficit shift a problem the shifting politics of the deficit leads to another question should we be worried about side effects on the broader economic backdrop the simple answer is no both neoclassical and to a lesser degree keynesian branches of economic theory would argue that running large deficits during periods of economic expansion have negative side effects inflation as too much deficit fueled demand chases fixed productive capacity is one example another would be mis allocation of resources with too much government investment in politically popular projects crowding out more efficient private sector investment but so far we haven t seen those negative effects the fed has cut rates three times this year in part over concerns that inflation is too low meanwhile combined public and private spending net of depreciation as a percentage of gdp a solid proxy for total investment is running well below previous decades there just isn t enough investment going on for much of it to be allocated inefficiently george pearkes you don t need to reinvent the wheel to explain why inflation has been so low over the past decade a radical slowdown in the growth of total economy debt has meant that even with relatively quickly rising government debt inflation pressures have been muted advertisement in fact cuny economist jw mason argued in a recent presentation that if anything the deficit is still too low to get us economic growth back to its pre financial crisis strength and that side effects of running large deficits are minimal while the household financial and state local government sectors have continuously paid down debt for the past decade federal debt growth has served to pick up the slack and prevent broader whole economy deleveraging that growth has had limited negative side effects so far thanks in large part to the muted debt growth elsewhere given the apparent renewed focus on the political economy of deficits benefits it s worth asking why those benefits aren t getting more attention instead of efforts to wipe them out with deficit pay fors george pearkes is the global macro strategist for bespoke investment group he covers markets and economies around the

travel around pakistan s balochistan province and there s a good chance you ll find someone savouring an iranian yoghurt drink spiced with mint called the laban everyone is drinking it these days says sardar shaukat popalzai who runs a think tank in quetta the provincial capital balochistan borders iran s sistan baluchestan province and for decades traders have shipped goods between the two countries with little hindrance this balance of trade which for the most part has remained in iran s favour takes place in the informal sector where government s reach to tax and regulate the flow of goods is limited from shampoos skincare products to detergents and electronic appliances iranians products have long lined store shelves in the border regions of pakistan popalzai says iran has managed to carve out a market despite stifling us sanctions a lot of that has to do with the iranian culture i have not met a single iranian businessman who complains about his problems they just try to find a way around it but a lot of it also depends on tehran s policy to wean reliance away from oil and on to other sectors such as automobiles violent street protests eclipsed recent reports that iran aims to eliminate dependence on oil revenue to finance its next budget demonstrations swept across iran after the government increased petrol prices 50 percent to thirty us cents per litre at a time when people find it difficult to find jobs and inflation is expected to hit 35 percent this year since us president donald trump reimposed sanctions last year iran s economy has shrunk the imf estimates that iran s gdp will contract by more than 9 percent compared to what it was just two years back washington has introduced sanctions that inflict maximum damage on ordinary iranians by making it difficult for the islamic republic to export oil its major source of foreign exchange
have we been wrong all along today we confront a rather distressing possibility that this world may be in far better condition than we have previously supposed details grim details to follow but we begin with a diagnosis the stock market is evidently down with a spell of altitude sickness the air at 28 000 proved too thin for the dow jones industrial average the index has retreated to the 27 800 elevation there it presently rests breathes and consolidates both s p and nasdaq have also found sturdier footing beneath recent heights we suspect additional federal reserve open market operations will fill their lungs for the next assault upon the peaks but to return to today s question is this world in far superior condition than we have previously imagined certainty in an uncertain world in our customary telling the world gutters along in steady ruin botched beyond hope by day by hour by minute it rots down inexorably and unerringly see for example the number of riots presently besieging many of the world s cities see for example the israelis and palestinians see for example the economic stagnation that afflicts the globe see for example united states national debt they may be unpleasant realities yes but they confirm our distrusting biases they offer us the reassuring warmth of certainty in an uncertain world like a crackling fire on an arctic winter night but does the world actually exist in better condition than ever we must consider the possibility look first to warfare the most peaceable era in our species existence the percentage of individuals violently slain in prehistoric and stateless societies ranges between 5 and 60 but by 2007 warfare accounted for a vanishing 0 04 of the world s deaths and the present post wwii era it is the longest without major power conflict since the roman empire argues steven pinker author of the better angels of our nature why violence has declined today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species existence thus he invites you to disbelieve your lying eyes and ears just so you say but what about poverty is not much of the world sunk in deepest poverty the facts argue a drastically improving case extreme poverty has never been lower in 1990 nearly 2 billion people wallowed in extreme poverty as defined by the world bank or 36 of humanity yet by 2015 that ironically fat figure dropped to a gaunt 10 in all over 1 billion earthlings have stepped up from extreme poverty since 1990 if it is progress you seek here you are next we come to a recently hatched economic theory the theory of time prices it is the work of economists marian tupy and gale pooley time prices simply calculate the amount of labor required to purchase commodities and products the time price of commodities plunged 64 7 since 1980 here is what tupy and pooley s researches reveal time prices have plunged nearly 65 since 1980 that is the world s workers have had to slave less and less time to acquire the same wherewithal in their words we at 50 foundational commodities covering energy food materials and metals between 1980 and 2017 the real price of commodities fell by 36 on average commodities that took 60 minutes of work to buy in 1980 took only 21 minutes of work to buy in 2017 put differently the time price of commodities fell by 64 7 let us provide a cement example of time prices how long must an average blue collar work to pay for thanksgiving dinner next thursday is thanksgiving day how much time must the average blue collared american slave for this dinner in 1986 this serf toiled 32 minutes to pay for his turkey and all the victualry that attends it and now in anno domini 2019 that same average blue collared american will put in merely nine minutes of labor to pay for next thursday s enormity nine minutes down from 32 in 1986 futurist and technologist george gilder has fallen upon time price theory with a fearsome zeal like a man newly converted to the one true faith the bright world seen through the prism of time prices subpar growth secular stagnation negative interest rates and the devil and all today s bugaboos they vanish into nonexistence when you come at them with the time price theory argues gilder we have simply failed the measure the actual gdp gains consumer surplus productivity rises and radical new value created by pervasive high technology time prices make perfect sense of all these otherwise enigmatic ideas of negative interest rates secular stagnation monetary black holes sub par rates of growth negative yield curves missed inflation targets and bubbling asset prices what is more the history of time prices suggests that most of the deflation in free economies is a benign reflection of learning curves and entrepreneurial inventions time prices tell us that the global economy is in the midst of a fabulous period of technological innovation zero or negative interest rates for example fall to pieces under time price theory put on your time price bifocals says gilder you will then see today s interest rates are healthily positive interest rates have been normal when adjusted for plummeting time prices real interest rates after all are calculated by subtracting the rate of inflation from the nominal interest rate if inflation is negative because learning curves around the world are radically reducing costs and prices then you have to add the deflation rate to nominal interest measured by the number of hours and minutes a blue collar worker has to spend to buy the 50 commodities most vital for human survival prices have been dropping at a rate of 3 4 per year that means in real terms of hours and minutes rather than dollars and cents a zero interest rate translates into an utterly normal 3 4 rate we had better stop here lest our cherished theories of doom endure additional battering regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning
overview the combination of the victory of the pro democracy movement in hong kong and an apparent concession by china on intellectual property rights is helping bolster risk appetites to start the week equities are higher hong kong s led asia pacific equities with a 1 5 gain the second biggest this month korea and india s bourses also gained more than 1 europe s is up about 0 75 through the morning sessions and us shares are trading with an upside bias core benchmark 10 year bond yields have edged higher as have chinese and korean yields japan and the antipodean yields eased the is mixed is leading the major advancers gaining around 0 4 1 2880 the dollar bloc currencies and the are firmer while the and are nursing small losses is steady is heavy and looks poised to test the month s low near 1445 asia pacific beijing announced it would raise the penalties on violations of intellectual property it is also into lowering thresholds for criminal punishments for such violations and making it easier for the victims to receive compensation on the surface this may look like a concession to the us which has been pressing hard for greater protection is intellectual property rights yet the problem is often not that china has the wrong laws but that the laws are not enforced the contradiction is between the declaratory policy what it says and operational policy what it does hong kong s pro democracy forces scored a stunning victory in yesterday s election it appears to have won about 85 of the 452 seats that were contested compared with about a quarter in the last election in 2015 there was a recover voter turnover nearly twice the 2015 turnout while this is clearly a rebuke of the hk government and china the district council seats are not sufficient in themselves to enact fundamental change it nevertheless lays the foundation for next year s legislative council elections for which the popular vote selects half the members the imf called on the japanese government and the bank of japan to step up their cooperation while endorsing prime minister abe s fiscal plans supplemental budget in light of the sales tax increase and typhoon it suggested that the boj target shorter term rates while cutting its purchases of longer term bonds to steepen the yield curve the imf also suggested the central bank adopt a target range for inflation as opposed to a point target to enhance its flexibility and repeated its call for structural reforms it shaved this year s gdp forecast to 0 8 from 0 9 the imf forecasts 2020 growth of 0 5 which is what it estimates trend growth the dollar firmed to five day highs against the yen near jpy108 90 in asia before consolidating in the european morning the intraday technicals are a bit stretched and it is not clear the market is ready to challenge the month s high set near jpy109 50 on november 7 the australian dollar is also in a narrow range it tried pushing above 0 6800 but was turned back and is quiet near 0 6785 the november low is near 0 6770 the edged a little higher but the greenback remained on the cny7 03 handle europe the november survey lends support to ideas that the world s fourth largest economy has begun stabilizing the overall assessment by investors ticked up to 95 0 from a revised 94 7 was 94 6 in october it has not fallen since august though gains are modest the expectations component rose to 92 1 from 91 6 revised from 91 5 it is the second consecutive month of improvement something not seen since 2017 the assessment of the current conditions however remains in the trough it stands at 97 9 having bottomed in august at 97 4 with little fanfare moody s downgraded the outlook for german banks from stable to negative it warned that profitability and overall creditworthiness are likely to weaken further over the next 12 18 months its concerns are widely shared a day before moody s announcement the ecb identified weak bank profitability as one of the biggest threats to emu growth moody s recognized that the weak trade outlook had knock on effects for several key industries including autos parts ad chemicals on the same day moody s report the german bundesbank cautioned that credit risks were being underestimated half a dozen polls show the tories with at least a ten percentage point lead over labour as the campaigns turn to the homestretch ahead of the december 12 election the liberal democrats and brexit have generally seen their support slip labour appears to be counting on a strong turnout of young first time voters however the markets are anticipating that johnson remains the prime minister a tory victory is expected to lift sterling toward 1 35 or so we remain concerned that a no deal brexit at the end of next year remains a distinct possibility separately uber nyse was denied an operating license in london it was denied a license in september 2017 and engaged in a protracted struggle before winning a reprieve in september is was granted a two month extension that expires today the ride hailing service will continue to operate as it appeals today s decision the ostensible problem is with uninsured and unauthorized drivers the euro has marginally extended the pre weekend losses and is edging closer to the chart support around 1 10 the low for the month was set on november 14 near 1 0990 there is a 565 mln euro option struck at 1 1035 just above the session high which expires today sterling on the other hand is firm but within the range set before the weekend the pre weekend high was set near 1 2930 the intraday technicals are stretched as sterling approaches the 29 area where a gbp323 mln option is struck which also expires today america president trump has an important decision to make this week will he sign the hong kong bills that passed congress with near unanimity if he vetoes them and congress overrides the veto will china still recognize it as crossing a redline ironically china is defending the special trade privileges that the us grants the special administrative region it does not accept that the mainland s relations with hong kong are a fair reason to abrogate the deal which incidentally generated a 38 bln trade surplus for the us last years trump has another decision to be made in the coming weeks and that is what do about the roughly 160 bln of imports from china that are threatened with a 15 tariff on december 15 last month s tariffs were suspended and trump has both suggested that the december 15 tariffs could be suspended and that if not agreement is reached he will hike the tariffs canada s rail strike that began last tuesday involving 3200 conductors and yard operators is starting to paralyze economic activity wheat oil and aluminum that move by rail are being stymied this is impacting exports as well as shipments of propane used for heat domestically the union argues that the railways were engineering the propane shortage to force the government to intervene if the strike lasts until the end of next week when parliament returns the strike could shave a quarter of one percent off q4 gdp according to some estimates roughly a fifth of canada s exports which are around 30 of gdp is carried by rail the us reports the and the both are expected to have improved sequentially but still be in contracting mode federal reserve chairman powell speaks after the us market close but before tokyo opens on tuesday powell s views are clear and no one really expects the fed to change rates at next month s fomc meeting december 11 it is a holiday shortened week for us markets though a rather busy week after today for high frequency economic reports canada s wholesales trade september does not move the markets the highlight of the week is q3 gdp at the end of the week the median forecast in the bloomberg survey is for a 1 3 annualized expansion down from 3 7 in q2 mexico reports its final estimate of q3 gdp today it had previously estimated growth of 0 1 quarter over year and minus 0 4 year over year not seasonally adjusted mexico s central bank has cut rates three times here in the second half it meets again on december 19 many are looking for another cut but it is a close call the us dollar recovered from about cad1 3255 to cad1 3300 before the weekend it is hovering around that high today last week s high was near cad1 3330 and we look for a push above there to test last month s high close to cad1 3350 that said the technical indicators are getting stretched the dollar has slipped to a four day low near mxn19 3150 against the mexican peso in europe it has climbed back to mxn19 3830 the intraday technicals are extended and initial resistance near mxn19 40 may keep the greenback in check pending other developments the dollar index is consolidating near its pre weekend highs around 98 30 the 98 50 area was the best it has seen this month above there resistance is seen near 98 70

the country s financial team may take satisfaction in the fact that its decision to allow foreign investment in government papers has fetched 713 million at a time when foreign exchange inflows were falling short of expectations along with a huge drop in imports and a nominal increase in export earnings foreign investment in government securities has helped improve the external position after four years of deficits the current account recorded a surplus of 99m in october critics however say that it is hot money which is being attracted at prohibitive costs they argue that this footloose money is like a migratory bird which flies out at the first sign of economic distress in the last auction held on nov 6 investments in three and six month treasury bills were attracted at cut off yields of 13 28 per cent and 13 29pc respectively pointing out that interest rates offered were the highest in the world critics question as to what kind of stability the hot money will deliver this costly borrowing also indicates the kind of efforts which are being made to achieve macroeconomic stability similarly prime minister s advisor on finance hafeez sheikh wants to offer incentives to bring back money parked abroad a task which he says seems almost impossible he thinks that the only way to do so is to introduce a policy regime in such a way that it becomes attractive to bring money from abroad addressing a regional conference in islamabad recently he pointed out that money has no nationality here one may recall that even the united states had to offer one time tax concessions to attract funds legally kept overseas by its multinationals amnesty schemes have not been a real success the government should consider proposals that investors should be allowed to bring their money with no questions asked if the funds are invested in prioritised manufacturing sectors identified to improve trade balance referring to expectations from overseas pakistanis he observed that they are very smart and they would also bring money here just as anyone else thinks when it is attractive to bring their money capital flight occurs when the domestic business environment becomes inhospitable as is the situation today in a meeting with members of the leading trade body mr sheikh said the most difficult period has been managed we are on the road to recovery disagreeing a segment of the audience argued that a reality check was needed and pleaded that their concerns needed to be addressed to quote a pakistani social scientist when capital crosses domestic frontiers it loses its links with national social and economic progress a part of the outflows can be explained by some people investing in euro dollars to protect the value of their money because of almost continuous depreciation of the rupee then these hard currencies are used for under invoiced imports to evade customs duties for lowering the cost of plants and machinery the rupee is currently undervalued by 6pc independent analysts say with falling global foreign direct investment fdi flows contributing to a surge in global debt stock it would be worthwhile to make a fresh effort to bring back money stashed abroad and encourage overseas pakistanis to invest in the country of their origin as free flow of funds is legally allowed in developed western markets money has to be incentivised to take pakistani nationality fdi is plummeting the world over because of the faulty approach towards globalisation pakistan also represents this global trend but not the improved one witnessed in resurgent asia the fdi inflow to pakistan during the july october period was a mere 385m according to unctad s world investment report 2019 global fdi flows fell by 13pc to 1 3 trillion in 2018 which is the lowest level since the global financial crisis of 2007 08 fdi flows to developed countries reached the lowest point since 2004 on the other hand the share of developing economies in the declining fdi flows increased to a record 54pc with asia being the largest recipient another study shows that in the first half of 2019 global fdi flows decreased further by 20pc compared to the second half of 2018 this is attributed to uncertainty regarding trade tensions and prospects to future economic growth the world is witnessing a return to protectionism and the international market is getting fragmented the global debt to quote a report of the institute of international finance is on course to end 2019 at a record high of more than 255tr three times the world s annual output amnesty schemes floated by pakistan have not been a real success the government should consider proposals made years ago that investors should be allowed to bring their money with no questions asked if the funds are invested in prioritised manufacturing sectors identified to improve trade balance the revenue approach to taxation should be replaced by a growth oriented tax policy simultaneously steps should be taken to divert

it is nearly 15 years since ben bernanke then the chairman of the federal reserve argued that a global saving glut had fueled a giant current account deficit in the u s much has changed since then the u s deficit has shrunk oil exporters surpluses have dwindled and central banks everywhere have dramatically expanded their balance sheets but another feature of the world that bernanke described in early 2005 looks strikingly familiar asia s stockpile of savings remains enormous and it is getting bigger by the year for east asia as a whole each year gross domestic savings add up to 35 of gdp and little has changed over the past three decades this is not just an academic curiosity bernanke s concern in the early 2000s was that asia s excess cash was flooding into bond markets in the u s and beyond depressing long term real interest rates when the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 some economists pointed to the asian saving glut as an underlying cause of the housing boom and bust from las vegas to dublin with interest rates even lower now some are again asking whether excessive saving in asia is storing up trouble for the global economy there are certainly echoes with 15 years ago high savings rates in asia continue to translate into large current account surpluses over the past five years east asia s current account surplus has averaged about 525 billion annually a touch higher in cash terms than the average in the five years preceding the 2008 crisis the distribution has shifted china s surplus peaked a decade ago while those of south korea and taiwan are bigger than they used to be the current account surpluses in asia s big economies add up to about 0 6 of global gdp roughly the same as that of europe s surplus economies including germany s in combination it is one of the main global cross border flows impacting asset markets and pulling down yields globally said brad setser an economist with the council on foreign relations in new york wider array of investors in the early 2000s the focus was on asia s currency reserves especially china s much of which ended up in safe assets such as u s treasuries now a wider array of asian investors are channeling household and corporate savings into global markets but their effect can in some segments be more pronounced the imf calculates that taiwanese life insurers own 18 of all dollar debt issued by non u s banks japanese banks own about 15 of globally issued collateralized loan obligations potentially risky securitizations of corporate debt south korea s national pension fund the world s third biggest with nearly 600 billion in assets plans to double its investments in foreign bonds over the next five years nevertheless the continued rise in asian savings looks less harmful from other angles most critically it has not been accompanied by the same degree of intervention to hold down currencies as in the early 2000s then china was the most flagrant actor but its central bank is no longer a big buyer of dollars if anything its enforcement of capital controls has probably kept the yuan from falling more sharply across much of asia tolerance for stronger currencies has increased of the 60 economies monitored by the bank for international settlements only 16 have seen their real effective exchange rates rise by more than 5 since 2010 of this small group seven are asian some countries have also taken steps to make their role in currency markets more transparent the u s treasury has welcomed decisions by south korea and singapore to start publishing regular data about their interventions that said other countries are now intervening more heavily vietnam and thailand have started accumulating foreign exchange reserves at a rapid clip and setser has published forensic analysis suggesting that taiwan s currency reserves might be 40 bigger than officially declared because the country s central bank does not report its exposure to derivatives a broader question is whether asia should be faulted for its predilection for saving take singapore which lies at the extreme end with a current account surplus of 18 of gdp the imf argues that the country s external position is substantially stronger than warranted by fundamentals it has called for the government to spend more on infrastructure and on social security which would help reduce its citizens precautionary savings but singapore has pushed back against such criticisms before the mid 1980s it regularly ran a current account deficit its surplus ballooned as it hit a demographic sweet spot with lots of workers and few retired people a question of blame in the coming years though it expects its surplus to narrow as its population gets older households will draw down savings and the government will face mounting health care costs for china south korea and taiwan all of which are set to age rapidly the dynamics are likely to be similar economists also continue to question how much blame asian savers really deserve for the global financial turmoil of 2008 there were plenty of other culprits they included lax mortgage regulations in the u s and rash european banks which borrowed heavily and scooped up dangerous debt products today the west is doing much on its own terms that is alarming enough from the u s trade wars to europe s inability to muster a coordinated fiscal response to its economic woes surplus savings in asia are yet another drag on a world suffering from weak demand but of all the things to worry about they are not top of the list
with media outlets crowding around the current impeachment probe it can be hard to realize that in the rest of the federal government is continuing apace with new ideas and avenues for helping the country to learn more about the work the government is doing despite all eyes being fixed on the president we spoke with richard levick founder of levick barry bennett founder of avenue strategies and manuel ortiz founder of vantageknight aberman so give me what s happening in washington let s start with taxes that seems to be something that a lot of people care about i ve seen a lot of proposals has there been any action what s going on bennett well everybody s paying a little bit less the coffers are filling more rapidly than ever but coffers can t keep up with our desire to spend unfortunately eventually the truth is going to have to hit this town very hard but right now we just continue to look the other way and pretend it s not happening aberman you mean from the standpoint of just the realities we collect what 17 percent of gnp in taxes and spend 23 or so on government it s just it s not sustainable the perspective is it s not sustainable but there s there s conflict about how to address that you can cut expenses which congress seems to be unable to do so far or you can raise taxes i see and hear that a lot from democratic advisers ortiz not many subjects change the bottom line of a company more than taxes the trump gop tax bill did a lot to lower corporate taxes and reform the way offshore taxes were being treated by the tax code but it was done so quickly that there s a ton of technical corrections and issues that they ve got to fix so there s bipartisan agreement that there needs to be a tax corrections bill so folks are anticipating and working on that the politics of that are similar to obamacare and the medicaid field and the healthcare field where it got passed by only democrats subscribe to the what s working in washington podcast on itunes so there s a lot of resentment back and forth on such a big tax reform the first one to be done since the 80s and now they know they need to rework to package again but the politics are so tricky so folks are looking to tax extenders and other things and looking at the end of the year type of big bill to put certain tax provisions that hurt or help bottom line depending on where you sit aberman it s interesting to me that you look at something complex like the tax bill you know just a very narrow example which i ve looked at you know the idea of driving money into specific parts of the country people who want to invest for risk you know like venture investing they can t figure out whether or not the rules will allow them to do it and that would be something that would be good to clarify are there areas where there is a bipartisan acknowledgement that there need to be technical changes made in how the country functions that can transcend the polarization do you see that happening bennett you know i think it actually has to start with an education campaign people have to understand a lot more about how much wealth there is out there what you can do to tax it what the tax effect means i mean bill gates is now the richest man in the world he could afford to build 20 wilson bridges so he s got a lot of money but we could take all of his money and not make a dent in that highway trust fund it s easy to throw out solutions about you know we re going to just take all of bill gates wealth even that doesn t get us anywhere near where we need to be levick haven t we in fact gone backwards george will would argue that we never created a deficit we never borrowed from the future unless it was for the future it was for highways it was for the military but now we do it as an accounting gimmick to help us get reelected and as jonathan says not have to worry about paying the piper now bennett absolutely i think i think debt is a good thing if you re using debt to build a building on a campus or building a bridge is fine with debt but borrowing money to make transfer payments is absurd aberman i think that that s really the fundamental question that i see as a former financial service professional and i m a democrat and yet i know that at some point the books have to balance otherwise we become greece and i m sympathetic to that but i find when i try to have conversations about that on either side of the aisle right now it s very hard to have a rational conversation ortiz well one of the things that the lawmakers that passed the tax bill were counting on was for as you reduce the corporate rate you have these companies reinvesting in other things using that money to grow the economy i guess to barry s point if you issue debt to make the economy grow and your gdp is up jobs are down then the economics would say that s a good that s a good deal because you re growing the economy we ve seen that in other places that tried to cut themselves to drive off economic crisis it doesn t work very well greece comes to mind aberman austerity doesn t create growth ortiz i think that s what people are counting on the new york times had a piece on some of the corporations which i didn t necessarily think it was all that fair but the point was that the corporations were doing what they said they would do in terms of creating jobs and so on fedex for example and i have to tell you fred smith is in my view one of the best ceos out there and i think they ve done a pretty good job of using that money and recapitalizing some of their pension spending you know mr smith had a few priorities certainly lowering corporate rates was one of them he gave a couple of speeches in d c to that effect so i thought he got a little kind of a bum deal there that i know he took personally because he invited the editor of the new york times to debate policy but anyway the point being tax committees have usually traditionally been less political or partisan than other committees and the regular order of things works and i could see something coming together whether it s extenders or another package coming together at the end of the year that tries to address that type of growth or you know solar taxes renewable taxes some other trade between groups that come together and get some sort of provision to try to do stimulus bennett you know capital is piling up in the country at record levels i mean apple is sitting on tons of cash aberman well arguably the stock market is being driven by all this liquidity it s got no place to go bennett right so i think the one thing that the government could do that it s not currently doing is one investors want certainty right they want to lower the risk as much as possible so some kind of long term certainty is vitally important but we also need to use the levers in these tax committees to incentivize companies like apple i mean the president was down in austin yesterday where they re going to make that the new apple macbook pro x 15 whatever it is in texas and that s very exciting there s a cell phone that s being manufactured now in texas i think we could be on the cusp of this manufacturing renaissance the capital is here we just need the right government incentives perhaps or at least the government encouragement and cheerleading to start bringing these new factories into america who granted i mean the labor is going to be much much less but even if a factory creates 50 instead of 500 those are 50 new important jobs levick a couple thoughts on that one is i hope that you re right regarding the manufacturing renaissance and you re certainly right in terms of labor costs but one area that i don t think we ve explored as much is that we have in america the ability to be more efficient from a manufacturing point of view that can more than make up for the delta in labor costs but the other issue is in terms of the president s visit to the apple factory it s a six year old factory that predates him by his administration by three years aberman i m really concerned about whether or not we can resolve these things and balance our books what s driving us apart richard i know you ve got a lot of historical context you travel around the world is this an american phenomenon a national phenomenon what do you think levick there s clearly a global phenomenon and you know i m not sure what part is driving what is it the politics or is it the disruption led by technology i sort of lean towards the technological disruption and i don t think that the disruption is here per se it s here for newspapers it s here for radio it s here for other media and it s here for many of our jobs but we all know and this is where the fear factor comes in we re at the very beginning of the inverted hockey stick and i think that you know recently i was a guest lecturing at a graduate business school and they asked the question of disruption they asked the question of income inequality and clearly there was fear we re afraid we re not going to do as well no matter how many more degrees skills that we have than our parents did and i think it s that fear that s driving it s the fear that the future equals less and because of that scarcity mentality means we re all taking what s ours now and we re not leaving any of the seeds in the ground to be harvested later aberman you know it s funny you talk scarcity mentality because i find when i talk with my peers that are well off there is in a lot of cases almost a hysterical fear that the people are going to tax them like crazy they re going to lose everything and when i talk with friends that are progressive or socialist in politics they re absolutely convinced that that the rich people need to be taxed like crazy and we need to do redistribution i mean i ll tell you i don t think either extreme position actually will get us to the right outcome when you go off and talk with people from the perspective of advising people on how to manage washington or work with people who are politically engaged how do you counsel them or can you counsel them to move off these extreme positions ortiz well let me take a stab at that what i hear all the time from concerned ceos is the sound bites and the anger the notion of this income inequality the middle class we re losing the middle class the rich are getting richer the poor are getting poorer that policy gets lost in this legislating or policymaking and making good policy work for all americans and so we get back to the basics and my counsel to them is to lead with substance lead with data i think being a good advocate has changed through the years where in the old days it could have been sitting down and having a good relationship with someone through knowing a person for a long time now it s more about narratives and data and projections and numbers so you look at the two areas that we ve been discussing namely taxes and i would put in trade also we have an incredibly troublesome political environment around both yet we re likely heading to at the end of the year if a budget deal can get done and appropriations get done we ll have the renamed nafta package done by the house and we ll likely have a tax package that aims to regulate the economy so notwithstanding the toxicity out there congress is working back to the theme of that aberman so notwithstanding the rhetoric that s external there are things happening barry what do you see when you talk with folks on the republican side of things i mean are they moderating and do you think they ll ever moderate and be more interested in compromising bennett you know when i travel the country or internationally the frequently most asked question i get is what the heck is going on and i think we re at this point where convergence is not too strong a word where social media has now made everybody who has an opinion feel free to amplify it to the point where some mediums are completely worthless but we re also at this tectonic shift in an electoral realignment if you look at i ll pick on seniors as a demographic group george bush lost seniors both times john mccain lost seniors mitt romney lost seniors donald trump comes along and wins seniors by nine points why it s not because he has some kind of secret sauce right it s who constitutes seniors has changed the new dealers are dead i would prefer to say they re no longer participating in the democratic process but they ve been replaced by their sons or daughters and they have a very different affinity for government i mean my grandparents my grandfather served in world war two the g i bill all those programs they helped him he thought government helped him he was a lifelong democrat my mother my 80 year old mother who s now a senior doesn t think the government s ever done anything to help her her generation is the first that didn t serve 30 years at a company get a defined guaranteed pension benefit and so they have a much much much lower affinity towards government so that whole thing is change we re turning what we thought we understood about the silos of democrat voters republican voters and it s kind of being overturned and it s all going to sort out before we can really figure out how it is we come to some kind of solution aberman i think that s right i also think this overturning phenomena you describe you know it plays out for example in england with brexit i mean brexit does not cut across labour and conservative party lines at all and what s going in italy with politics we could go on and on and here s my theory it seems to me that we re at a moment in time where massive changes are causing people to really really be angry and look for simple solutions that will work and ultimately because the country and most countries are 50 50 split roughly nothing s really going to change and my theory is that sometime soon maybe in our electoral cycle or so people are just going to get exhausted and i think that s going to be the most interesting and dangerous moment for our country because at that point people either opt out completely or they actually will get more involved politically and force their politicians to be more consensus driven levick and first we re going to see record turnout that s what we re seeing in the off year elections and so we saw in virginia we re seeing record turnout and i think that will happen first before there is this giving up but jonathan you re right that what happens next is that the iron age which is the bottom of the cycle bennett well i mean i think that there s a large portion of america maybe as much as 30 percent of people live in a state where democrats control everything in that state and then there s another 20 percent of america who lives in a state where the republicans control everything in that state so when we look we see america as a 50 50 well it is but like ohio where i grew up always had a million more registered democrats than republicans today it 750 thousand more republicans than democrats to assume that the average ohio voter and the average california voter have anything in common that s kind of a big assumption levick where does that take us it s pulling apart the seams of the fabric of america bennett yeah i mean i during the campaign trail i spent a lot of time on cable news unfortunately but you know in the green rooms i would sit with my democrat strategists i m like how do we get out of this anger period right and consensus always was that in good economic times that people care less about politics and that kind of starts to subside but what we ve seen are some frankly very good economic times and the anger has done nothing but exacerbate i just saw a poll where 75 percent of people say that their friends and neighbors are more angry today than they were four years ago which is a little scary more than a little scary aberman well i don t want to end the show with that last sound bite because i agree with you it is scary i m gonna ask you just quickly richard what s your biggest reason for optimism about how this is going to turn out levick you know i keep getting asked that question and i don t have an answer other than to look historically and see that we keep getting up each morning and we keep marching forward i do think a great reason for optimism is the two other people in the studio with us because they re among the deepest insiders in washington among the kindest people and we ve worked together on multiple projects and i think that kind of wisdom carries us forward ortiz i have an unbelievably strong belief that the american public are wise and in this new age of information all the information out there is available that the country will be able to choose wise leaders that will bring solutions to them we as a country have to figure out income inequality and the dying middle class and once that s done i think the institution will be better bennett you know i m not terribly optimistic to say the truth i think this is probably the new normal and we re gonna have to get used to it for a while maybe a decade or two i mean these politicians are not very popular right now i mean i love the stat that you know donald trump s approval rating is what 43 44 percent which is historically awful but it also makes him the most popular politician in america today aberman that s a very good point well i ll tell you i m optimistic i m optimistic because 10 and 20 years seems like a long time but in the history of society and civilization it s but an eye blink and the roman empire lasted four thousand years governments and countries will subside and they ll continue if the culture is strong and the united states as far as i m concerned it was a great experiment 250 years ago and will be great experiment for years to come gentlemen thanks a lot for taking the time to

despite a temporary slowdown in the first half of the year mainly due to slow budget execution the macroeconomic outlook has remained favorable washington d c united states of america november 25 2019 apo group imf staff and the authorities reached staff level agreement for the sixth program review subject to approval by imf management and the executive board the implementation of the authorities program supported by the extended credit facility ecf arrangement has remained satisfactory the authorities plan to increase public investment and social spending requires continued efforts to raise revenue and contain transfers to the fuel and electricity sectors an international monetary fund imf mission led by charalambos tsangarides mission chief for madagascar visited antananarivo from november 11 to 25 to conduct discussions for the 2019 article iv consultation and the sixth and final review of madagascar s economic reform program supported by the ecf arrangement at the end of the mission mr tsangarides issued the following statement the discussions have allowed the authorities and the imf staff to reach staff level agreement for the sixth program review subject to approval by imf management and the executive board consideration by the imf s executive board is expected in january 2020 despite a temporary slowdown in the first half of the year mainly due to slow budget execution the macroeconomic outlook has remained favorable for 2019 growth is expected to improve to 4 8 percent supported by dynamic credit conditions and positive developments in mining transportation and services in a context of decreasing vanilla prices the current account is expected to record a small deficit after peaking in late 2017 inflation has continued to steadily decelerate and is expected to be contained to 6 percent by end year for 2020 economic prospects remain positive with real growth expected to reach 5 2 percent supported by increased public spending on infrastructure health and education and increasing private sector activity especially in tourism other services and light manufacturing the implementation of the ecf supported program that expires in early 2020 has remained satisfactory the authorities met all the june 2019 performance criteria as well as the indicative target on tax revenue collection however the indicative target on domestically financed priority social spending was missed by a significant margin despite recent improvements in execution the year end objective will not be met the central bank has continued to successfully reduce exchange rate volatility and support gradual accumulation of reserves and manage liquidity through timely interventions thus contributing to macroeconomic stability the authorities made some progress on the structural reform agenda albeit at a slower pace than envisaged despite the successful renegotiation of distribution margins on fuel prices a remaining gap between reference and pump prices led to continued accumulation of small liabilities to distributors staff welcomed the authorities commitment to strengthen growth enhance revenue collection and foster social inclusion supporting economic activity will require the strict prioritization and timely implementation of growth enhancing investment projects meeting the authorities ambitious tax revenue targets will critically depend on stepping up collection efforts cross checking information between customs and domestic tax administrations and revising tax expenditures and exemption regimes reducing poverty will necessitate strong public spending execution in the health and education sectors as well as containing lower priority public spending such as subsidies to fuel and electricity operators staff underscored the need to adopt a pricing mechanism that aligns pump prices with world price developments and to settle existing liabilities with distributors to avoid budget costs staff emphasized that such a mechanism would need to be implemented along with targeted social measures to protect the poor from the impact of potential future price adjustments to improve the operational and financial situation of the public utility jirama and ensure it does not weigh on the budget an encompassing strategy to raise revenues and improve governance is needed staff also support ongoing cost cutting measures including through the renegotiation of contracts with electricity and fuel suppliers and the audit of the company s arrears staff encouraged the authorities to continue improving governance including by stepping up the fight against corruption a key element to strengthen the business climate and attract private investment in this respect staff commended the authorities for adopting an ordinance on illicit asset recovery and urged its operationalization through the speedy adoption of the implementation decree to consolidate and deepen significant structural reforms undertaken at the central bank to strengthen the monetary policy framework and boost financial inclusion staff welcomed the authorities plans to submit the new banking law and the financial stability law to parliament the mission met with president andry rajoelina prime minister christian ntsay minister of economy and finance richard randriamandrato interim minister of energy water and hydrocarbons christian ramarolahy outgoing central bank of madagascar governor alain rasolofondraibe and new governor henri rabarijohn senior officials development partners as well as representatives of the private sector

from zero hedge it may come as a surprise to some younger americans but the us did not always have income tax in fact one of the main catalysts behind the american revolution and resulting war of independence was the colonial protest against british taxation policy in the 1760s then in the beginning the independent nation collected taxes on imports whiskey and for a while on glass windows even as states and localities collected poll taxes on voters and property taxes on land and commercial buildings in addition there were state and federal excise taxes but all throughout there was no official income tax for nearly a century and a half yet while the united states imposed income taxes briefly during the civil war and the 1890s it was not until the 16th amendment was ratified that the us permanently legalized a federal income tax in 1913 incidentally that was the same momentous year just before the start of world war i that another milestone event in us history took place the birth of the federal reserve shortly thereafter states also began collecting sales taxes in the 1930s ever since then the history of us taxation has been on of optimal outcomes of progressive policies and ultimately of wealth redistribution according to whatever party or ideological bent was in control yet no matter what one though of us tax policy one thing was immutable it was always and only in the hands of the federal and state government to impose whatever taxation was deemed appropriate for better or worse tax was synonymous with politics that may be changing fast forward to 2019 when after a decade of unprecedented inequality spurred by the federal reserve s policies which made the rich richer and the poor and middle classes poorer to the point that just 1 of the us population now owns as much wealth as the middle and lower classes combined the same apolitical private federal reserve which is owned by a handful of commercial banks and whose members have never been subject to election by the general population now wishes to formalize its wealth redistribution agenda and effectively become a political force which determines who gets richer and who gets poorer as bloomberg news reports today now that it can no longer report on the travails of either its boss michael bloomberg or his challengers for the democratic primary even if it still has free reign to bash donald trump each and every day neel kashkari the former goldman employee who was instrumental in the drafting of tarp and the bailout of the us financial system and outspoken dove at the minneapolis fed said monetary policy can play the kind of redistributing role once thought to be the preserve of elected officials and as bloomberg notes while that likely remains a minority view among u s central bankers kashkari has helped lay the groundwork for a shift in fed communication this year needless to say while kashkari is all for deciding who gets what arguably the most political of positions he is very much against being subject to a periodic popular vote because you know the fed knows best and once you permit a democratic choice the whole myth of an omnipotent fed falls apart as such what kashkari is proposing is despotism pure and simple one where a group of unelected career economists and various other bureaucrats has the final say on not only the price of money determined by the fed funds rate but also who ends up getting that money we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us while the fed sternly refuses to acknoleldge that the rotting cancer at the heart of its chronic inability to correctly diagnose the us economy just over a year ago we were a long way away from neutral then just a few months later the fed flipped a u turn and not only started slashing rates but launched qe4 is its inability to correctly measure inflation and specifically admit that asset price inflation matters just as much as economic inflation even as it chronically underestimates just how disproportionately more rising prices impact poorer americans compared to richer ones as we discussed previously here it appears to be more than happy to propose expanding its role and besides determining monetary policy it is now generously willing to also opine on proper wealth distribution read keeping rates low forever and dooming all those who save to financial extinction enter former goldmanite and pimcoite neel kashkari who believes he is the man best suited for the monumental task of singlehandedly deciding an outcome best left for the entire economy when kashkari a year into his job launched an in house effort in 2017 to examine widening disparities in the economy yet clearly failing to realize the fed s own massive contribution to the record wealth inequality between the rich and poor as it was the fed s policies that made those handful of americans who owned financial assets richer than ever while redistributing wealth away from savers and the rest of the american population he was expecting to generate research that might inform lawmakers decisions rather than the fed s we had historically said distributional outcomes monetary policy has no role to play kashkari told bloomberg in an october interview that was kind of the standard view at the fed and i came in assuming that i now think that s wrong for those confused by this word salad what kashkari now thinks is that it is right for the fed to have a role in deciding distribution outcome the bloomberg article then launches into an extended report of just how kashkari hopes to legitimize his effort of elevating the fed to the rank of supreme us despot an emperor s circle of unelected career economists who take central planning in the us to a level the ussr never even conceived of and we are confident readers can go through it on their own especially since it includes such phrases as paradigm shift which is what the bloomberg writer decided to throw in to indicate just how above the average reader he himself is what we will say is this trickle down economics has failed every single time and now instead of finally admitting that this core premise behind its 106 years of failed monetary policies which have made the bubble bust mentality the norm and which guarantee that the next crash may well wipe out not only the fed itself but western civilization as we know it the fed s proposal is a modest one give it even more power to determine who is rich and who is poor and asks just one thing trust it that this time it will get it right of course the real motive behind kashkari s modest proposal is even more nefarious the eventual fusion of monetary and fiscal policy which in turn will greenlight the direct monetization of us debt by some super governmental authority call it the treasury or whatever one which we are confident will also be headed by a group of people who will never be subject to a popular vote in hopes of allowing the us to effectively issue unlimited amounts of debt i e launch mmt in the process sparking enough inflation to finally inflate away america s staggering debt load this will go on as long as the us dollar maintains its reserve status a process that will be vastly accelerated should kashkari s proposal which one can comfortably argue is far more aligned with what putin could desire in terms of destroying america s superpower status than anything trump has done to date get solid footing among the intellectual elite of the united states of course long before the collapse of the dollar it will also result in civil war because if there is one thing the fed knows how to do and we say this without jest of sarcasm is to make the rich even richer and the poor poorer however it is safe to say that us society is already nearing its breaking point and should the fed officially rather than just unofficially enter the wealth redistribution process that would without doubt be the straw that finally breaks the american camel s back

with brent d griffiths the ticker it remains to be seen whether democratic voters will embrace mike bloomberg now that he is officially a 2020 candidate but his late entry should be welcome news to chinese leaders the billionaire and former new york city mayor is likely the field s most beijing friendly candidate he s argued against the u s china trade war maintained investments in china hosted a conference there and frequently speaks up on behalf of its regime his approach has drawn criticism from conservatives but it also represents a vulnerability in a democratic race that has embraced a more confrontational posture toward the chinese government it s an issue bloomberg is wrestling with in real time just last week as he prepared to jump into the race he canceled a planned appearance in beijing at the new economy forum a conference hosted by his company bloomberg lp and attended by top chinese officials advertisement he tapped former treasury secretary hank paulson to open the event in his stead my good friend michael bloomberg asked henry kissinger and me to represent him here today because as you all know he s made a decision to serve his country paulson said name checking the former secretary of state who has long worked to promote ties between the united states and china bloomberg s view of china s authoritarian government has elicited closer scrutiny since he began signaling an interest in a bid he d sworn off earlier this year in particular he faced blowback for defending chinese president xi jinping in a september interview with pbs s firing line the communist party wants to stay in power in china and they listen to the public bloomberg said on the show xi jinping is not a dictator he has to satisfy his constituents or he s not going to survive pressed by host margaret hoover on whether he really believes xi is not a dictator bloomberg emphasized his point no he has a constituency to answer to bloomberg said no government survives without the will of the majority of its people okay the chinese communist party looks at russia and they look for where the communist party is and they don t find it anymore and they don t want that to happen so they really are responsive this is a stark contrast to the situation on the ground where over a million muslim uighurs have been forced into detention camps and pro democracy protests in hong kong face live rounds and tear gas advertisement the claim flies in the face of a spate of chinese crackdowns including the forcing of over a million musliim uighurs into detention camps and the use of live rounds and tear gas on pro democracy protesters in hong kong the exchange prompted washington post columnist josh rogin to write that bloomberg s record on china shows he is the wrong person to guide our country in confronting this historic challenge rogin went on to detail bloomberg s extensive financial interest in the country bloomberg lp doesn t make money in china only by selling terminals through its massive bloomberg barclays global aggregate bond index bloomberg lp is helping finance chinese companies by sending billions of u s investor dollars into the chinese bond market this year the index began a 20 month plan to support 364 chinese firms by directing an estimated 150 billion into their bond offerings including 159 controlled directly by the chinese government bloomberg along with other wall street firms is effectively supporting the chinese government s efforts to resist the u s government s economic pressure while exposing american investors to increased risk rogin argued that there is nothing inherently wrong with bloomberg s business activities in china it is after all a common practice on wall street but if bloomberg really believes what he says his misreading of the chinese government s character and ambitions could be devastating for u s national security and foreign policy he wrote he would be advocating for a naive policy of engagement and wishful thinking that has already been tried and failed advertisement bloomberg s accommodating approach to china has extended to his media company bloomberg news in 2013 killed news stories that could have angered chinese leaders the new york times reported the outlet s top editor at the time denied the story as president trump ramped up his trade war with beijing last year the former mayor called for another path forward speaking at bloomberg s new york headquarters at a conference co hosted china general chamber of commerce usa he said the u s and china must find ways to work together other countries around the world again including china are responding with their tariffs and we don t need a trade war the other democratic contenders have staked out a range of positions on china but

exchange program november 25 2019 on the heterogeneous welfare gains and losses from trade daniel carroll sewon hur journal of monetary economics forthcoming abstract how are the gains and losses from trade distributed across households we document that tradable goods and services constitute a larger fraction of expenditures for low wealth and low income households using a trade model with nonhomothetic preferences and uninsurable earnings risk we measure the differential welfare gains from trade along the income and wealth distribution a permanent reduction in trade costs that generates the rise in import share of gdp seen in the data from 2001 to 2014 leads to 57 percent larger welfare gains for households in the lowest wealth decile relative to those in the highest wealth decile shocked into service free trade and the american south s military burden adam dean jonathan obert international interactions forthcoming abstract free trade has gradually shifted the burden of military service onto the american south while trade shocks generally lead to local increases in us army enlistment there are two different regional dynamics that concentrate this effect in the south first trade related job losses are disproportionately concentrated in this region where manufacturing jobs gradually migrated during the second half of the twentieth century second the south s military tradition a relatively youthful population and weak labor unions combine to translate trade shocks into larger spikes in army enlistment than the rest of the country this paper uses county level data from 1996 2010 to demonstrate the importance of meso level regional factors for understanding the location of trade shocks as well as how communities adjust to such economic dislocations we find that trade related job losses account for roughly 7 of the south s over representation in the army during our period of study employment consequences of u s trade wars sanjana goswami university of california working paper november 2019 abstract this paper provides evidence on the short run and long run distributional effects of tariff shocks on employment in the united states using monthly data on tariffs and employment i find that in the period of january 2017 to march 2019 commuting zones more exposed to chinese retaliatory tariffs experienced a decline in employment growth whereas u s import tariffs had no immediate effect on employment growth i also study the employment effects of a hypothetical trade war between the united states and china by calculating counterfactual employment changes under three different retaliation scenarios and find that had the u s imposed tariffs in the 1991 2007 period on all products the large job destroying effect of the china shock would not have occurred irrespective of the retaliation strategy pursued by china however in the post recession period of 2010 2016 the china shock no longer exists and therefore u s import tariffs would not have had a job creating effect this result corroborates the findings of the short run analysis the consumption response to trade shocks evidence from the us china trade war michael waugh nber working paper october 2019 abstract this paper provides evidence on the consumption effects of trade shocks by exploiting changes in us and chinese trade policy between 2017 and 2018 the analysis uses a unique data set with the universe of new auto sales at the us county level at a monthly frequency and a simple difference in difference approach to measure the effect of changes in trade policy on county level consumption as a lower bound i estimate the elasticity of consumption growth to chinese retaliatory tariffs to be around 1 this implies that counties in the upper quartile of the retaliatory tariff distribution experienced a 3 8 percentage point decline in consumption growth i further show that the consumption response corresponds with a decline in employment growth these results suggest that chinese retaliation is leading to concentrated welfare losses in the us tariff passthrough at the border and at the store evidence from us trade policy alberto cavallo et al nber working paper october 2019 abstract we use micro data collected at the border and at retailers to characterize the effects of recent changes in us trade policy particularly the tariffs placed on imports from china on importers consumers and exporters we start by documenting that the tariffs were almost fully passed through to total prices paid by importers suggesting that incidence has fallen largely on the united states since we estimate the response of prices to exchange rates to be far more muted the recent depreciation of china s renminbi is unlikely to alter this conclusion next using product level data from several large retailers we demonstrate that the tariffs impact on retail prices is more mixed some affected product categories have seen sharp price increases but the difference between affected and unaffected products is generally quite modest suggesting that retail margins have fallen these retailers imports increased after the initial announcement of possible tariffs but before their full implementation so the intermediate passthrough of tariffs to their prices may not persist finally in contrast to the case of foreign exporters facing us tariffs we show that us exporters lowered their prices on goods subjected to foreign retaliatory tariffs compared to exports of non targeted goods making only america great non u s market reactions to u s tax reform fabio gaertner jeffrey hoopes braden williams management science forthcoming abstract we study the foreign externalities of the recent u s tax reform commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja specifically we examine foreign firms stock returns around key tax reform events we find significant heterogeneity in market responses by country industry and firm chinese firms experience large negative returns especially in steel business equipment and chemical manufacturers whereas the rest of the world experiences positive returns firms operating in more differentiated product markets experience positive returns whereas firms in financial distress experience negative returns consistent with the tcja having competitive repercussions we also find that firms experiencing decreases in effective tax rates following tax reform experience positive returns overall our results suggest that the tcja had varied yet systematic effects on foreign firms shareholders wealth and the global competitive landscape does the closing of sweatshops in bangladesh save child workers an empirical study of a u s child labor prohibition bill siyu quan tulane university working paper november 2019 abstract in early 1993 senator tom harkin proposed the first bill in the us congress to explicitly prohibit the importation into the u s of ready made garments made by child labor in this paper i use the bangladeshi household expenditure survey waves 1991 1995 and 2000 to identify the effects of the bill on the employment status and rate of school enrollment on urban bangladeshi girls under 15 years of age the age group that was directly targeted and therefore more likely to be affected by the bill using a difference in difference did model i find that due to harkin s bill the employment rate of urban bangladeshi girls under 15 increased and their probability of being enrolled in school decreased i also use a regression discontinuity design rdd to estimate policy impact using 15 as the cutoff age and comparing results for before and after the policy was implemented i find that there is a jump in the industry factory sector employment rate the results obtained using both methodologies imply that a direct ban on child labor itself does not have the intended effects of reducing the rate of child employment or improving children s educational outcomes the role of oil in the allocation of foreign aid the case of the g7 donors cécile couharde et al journal of comparative economics forthcoming abstract while it is often alleged that oil endowment might influence the destination of foreign aid there is a lack of empirical evidence of how and why such an effect may come into play and even less so of the channels through which it works this paper aims to bring evidence that contributes to addressing those points specifically we investigate the role of oil in aid allocation of the g7 donors results show that unsurprisingly aid allocated by these donors increases significantly with oil endowment of recipient countries looking more deeply we interestingly show that their strategic interests in terms of oil security play a role in their provision of aid more importantly we provide evidence on the existence of competition for access to oil supplies among this group of donors the chilling effect of international investment disputes limited challenges to state sovereignty carolina moehlecke international studies quarterly forthcoming abstract despite suggestions that international investment disputes impose a chilling effect on governments autonomy to set regulatory policies we lack empirical confirmation of the phenomenon and what explains its heterogeneity across countries using a novel dataset of nine anti smoking regulations in ninety two countries from 1973 to 2016 i confirm the presence of the chilling effect but also its boundaries i show that countries have been significantly slower in implementing two anti smoking policies formally challenged under investment law while the adoption of seven undisputed regulations in this issue area continued unimpeded qualitative evidence from respondent and third party governments confirm the policy specificity of the chilling effect and show that both developed and developing countries were affected by the chill albeit differently by providing the first empirical confirmation of a regulatory chill and by defining its limited scope in one of the most high profiled international investment disputes to date my findings indicate that even though multinational corporations can constrain state sovereignty their effects are not necessarily expansive or indefinite

for decades liberals have called for government action to correct the excesses of the free market progressive taxation public health insurance unemployment insurance social security and health safety and environmental regulations the 2020 campaign featuring proposals for higher taxes on the wealthy medicare for all and the green new deal is no exception but some of the candidates sen elizabeth warren in particular are taking a fundamentally different approach rather than compensating citizens for the unfortunate side effects of markets they seek to reshape the markets themselves warren s latest idea the stop wall street looting act is a perfect case in point she seeks to rewrite the rules to constrain private equity firms from simply selling off assets and laying off workers in companies they invest in and to press them to deliver more value to middle class consumers and the economy as a whole this concept which i call marketcraft makes market governance a core function of government comparable to statecraft the art of diplomacy governments are the architect of markets they not only lay the foundation for markets with the rule of law and property rights but also establish corporations the institutions at the heart of the capitalist economy they foster stock markets via limited liability disclosure requirements and trading rules they promote competition via antitrust policy and pro competitive regulation and they define the core commodity of the digital age information via intellectual property rights thinking of government in this way opens us up to a profound rethinking of policymaking one that is both less radical than democratic socialism because it embraces capitalism and more radical because it seeks to transform capitalism from its roots this perspective abandons the pretense that markets are free or natural in favor of a more realistic view the alternative to government action is not free markets but real world markets riddled with imbalances of power collusion and fraud rather than trying to correct the results of these imbalances after the fact the government should not be shy about reshaping these markets to make them work better through measures like corporate governance financial regulation labor practices and antitrust enforcement the new deal was marketcraft in action both left and right misunderstand how governments craft markets those on the right tend to argue that the government should leave things to the market yet such laissez faire is not only undesirable it is impossible modern economies rest on the foundation of government regulation the real choices are not about whether the government should intervene in the economy but about how the government should structure markets from the outset many on the left are equally confused but in a different way they are suspicious of market solutions because they view these solutions as undemocratic and threatening to their values but governments can craft markets to promote whatever policy goals they choose including progressive goals such as economic equality or environmental protection the recent proposals to reform marketcraft have historical precedent beginning with the ideas of the early 20th century progressive movement proactive marketcraft became national policy under the new deal in the 1930s the banking act of 1933 separated commercial from investment banking and created the federal deposit insurance system the securities act of 1933 mandated financial information disclosure and the securities exchange act of 1934 created the securities and exchange commission the national labor relations act of 1935 guaranteed collective bargaining rights and prohibited employer practices that would undermine them these reforms enabled financial markets to deliver more value to the economy at less risk and gave workers more bargaining power vis à vis their employers after world war ii though liberals focused less on marketcraft and more on keynesian macroeconomic policies welfare services social regulation and equal rights amid strong economic growth economic thinkers such as friedrich hayek and milton friedman claimed government intervention undermines free markets their arguments gained popular appeal after the stagflation of the 1970s provided the opening for president ronald reagan and others to put these ideas into practice by loosening financial regulation attacking union power and easing antitrust enforcement reagan s overhauls were not really about deregulation in the literal sense of reducing regulation but rather a reorientation of market rules to benefit the wealthy and powerful the neoliberal ideology that views government as an obstacle to the free market rather than as the architect of markets became so pervasive that progressives internalized some of its core precepts even as they battled the resulting policies proposing remedies for specific market failures rather than a more fundamental transformation of markets the democratic party even took a partial neoliberal turn under the administration of president bill clinton which enacted nafta and decided not to regulate financial derivatives market governance and inequality to illustrate how the marketcraft approach differs from the more traditional liberal policy agenda consider economic inequality a defining challenge of our time as thomas piketty demonstrated in his magisterial work capital in the twenty first century the united states since 1980 has experienced a historically unprecedented boom in the incomes of the top 1 percent of wage earners mostly corporate executives and especially the top 0 1 percent meanwhile most americans have gained little or nothing from the substantial productivity gains over this period piketty focuses particularly on tax policy in explaining this surge in inequality and in proposing remedies but failed marketcraft is at the heart of both the boom for the 1 percent and the stagnation for the rest and better marketcraft will be essential to reversing these trends us executive compensation has soared as corporate governance shifted toward the shareholder model under which managers are supposed to maximize financial returns for shareholders and not to reward stakeholders such as workers or customers legal and regulatory adjustments encouraged the business practices at the heart of this trend such as stock options and share buybacks which have not only boosted shareholder returns but also propelled skyrocketing executive pay at the cost of wages and investment meanwhile financial liberalization and lax enforcement have contributed to outsize profits and pay packages in the financial sector which has taken up a growing share of the economy in recent decades without delivering greater value to household investors changes in labor regulation and employer practices help explain the lack of gains for lower and middle class workers president ronald reagan cracked down on public sector unions and appointed more business friendly representatives to the national labor relations board nlrb state governments passed right to work laws that undermined union power by prohibiting mandatory union dues employers grew more combative in fighting unions hiring specialized consultants to help them decertify the organizations and democrats failed in attempts to pass legislation to preserve union strength throughout this period the increase in market concentration across many sectors of the economy has boosted inequality by raising the gap in corporate returns and executive compensation between the superstar firms and all others and undercut wages because dominant firms do not have to compete as much for workers laws governing intellectual property rights have contributed to economic inequality as firms in sectors that rely heavily on intellectual property such as high tech and pharmaceuticals have garnered especially high profits and executive pay the more standard liberal approach would compensate for inequalities that emerge from market competition with redistribution via the tax system and social services the marketcraft approach would shift the focus to predistribution the market rules that generate the inequality in the first place the government could recalibrate rules in these areas to give workers a more powerful voice in corporations to press financial institutions to deliver more value for the economy and fewer rents to themselves to shift the balance of power between employers and workers and to constrain market power to the benefit of workers and consumers that would not undermine american capitalism but revitalize it among the democratic candidates for president warren has gone the furthest with this agenda she proposes corporate governance reform to give labor representatives a voice on corporate boards and to constrain executives from manipulating financial returns to maximize their income from stock options she supports labor reforms to shift bargaining power from employers to workers she advocates more aggressive antitrust enforcement to constrain the market and political power of dominant firms and she backs regulation to impede finance executives from seizing outsize rents for themselves and their firms and to protect consumers from fraud to be clear this isn t a case against any of the other essential elements of a progressive agenda such as a more equitable tax system universal health insurance and public investment in education and infrastructure we need all of those things but progressives should embrace the reordering of capitalism as their priority instead of tolerating a rigged market system and then compensating workers or consumers for injustices through tax and welfare policies a turn to marketcraft would empower them to earn fair wages and to pay fair prices from the outset cross posted from vox

the following article was submitted by michael stark market analyst at exness it was a fairly active start to the week for a number of instruments including the euro gold the peso and the pound the focus of this week s economic data is gdp in various countries most notably the usa and germany but more abstract factors like trade wars and polling for the uk s upcoming election will probably have a role to play in markets the only significant news from central banks last week was the people s bank of china s decision to cut its loan prime rate by 0 05 to 4 15 this hasn t had much impact on usd cnh with the dollar holding fairly close to its recent highs on the four hour chart this week s main event among central banks is the bank of israel s meeting on monday afternoon the current expectation is for a cut of the benchmark rate to 0 1 from the current 0 25 such a cut if it occurred would probably not have a major effect on usd ils gbp ils etc however traders of these symbols should monitor the subsequent comments from the senior members of the boi gold euro four hour gold has in general continued its downtrend against the euro since the end of october mirroring more or less the picture for euro dollar on the same timeframe generally better sentiment in stock markets and the dollar s limited gains over the past few weeks have helped the euro make gains against the yellow metal the strongest area to the downside here appears to be the latest low a fortnight ago just above 1310 price action around when this zone was first reached suggests that a bounce might be expected if the area is tested again to the upside the value area between the 100 and 200 smas would be the first target for buyers this is an important range because the two moving averages nearly

friday morning cable four hour the pound has continued to be fairly volatile since last week as markets weigh up ever changing polls and data from the uk last week ended with something of a bang as flash manufacturing and service pmi missed expectations significantly so in the case of service pmi 48 6 is the steepest contraction in british services since july 2016 on monday of this week though the cbi s monthly survey of british retailers came in significantly better than expected 3 was the result for november against the consensus expectation for 10 the chart of the pound against the dollar also suggests that the pound is unlikely to extend its losses in the immediate future an upward crossover of the slow stochastic on monday morning came after a higher opening the two main moving averages 100 and 200 smas have closed their gap since last week though the current zone is likely to be unreliable as a value area given cable s volatility in the runup to the election on 12

week the technical picture continues to indicate that the bulls are in control here despite the inability of price to hold its new high in the middle of last week the downward reaction afterwards was not nearly as significant as that the week before after the bdem s meeting it also appears that the slow stochastic is about to produce a buy signal with an upward crossover in oversold finally we can

by lubinda haabazoka for a country to develop we need to unite towards a common goal our enemy is multinational capital that manipulates our economic growth and steals our mineral resources we blame one another for a poor economy forgetting the lack of forex is a result of multinational capital s unwillingness to bring it back to zambia we have been conditioned to fight one another country credit ratings are manipulated by people we think mean well for us but that s not the case unknowingly they influence our politics but we are too blind to see that because the battle is between tribes political parties and other different formations in fact we even go to them for funding one thing south africans or batswanas are better than us for is that they understand their national identity i have been repeatedly saying that bloomberg financial times african confidential rating agencies and other influencers of investor behavior can be manipulated to punish or support a country zambia at the moment is at a stage of being punished for its relationship with the dragon zambia at the moment is being punished for its strong stance on illicit financial flows in the mining sector we have for long underestimated the strength of the mining company monopoly capital this capital has the potential of influencing regime change by scaling down mining activities citing tax or any other factors the mining sector can also influence rating agencies and major tabloids to be in the negative about a particular country so as to reduce the economic fortunes of that country forget what we have borrowed for infrastructure development that s peanuts compared to what we are losing out through illicit financial flows we were advised by the imf and world bank to get a credit rating in order to access money from the international capital markets we got that and issued three eurobonds for which these institutions commended us so why are they blaming us for that debt today the eurobonds were advised on us to trap us and make us dance a certain tune eurobonds cannot be renegotiated one company even proposes to buy out government s 20 stake in a certain company for 750m to repay the eurobond due in 2022 what a bloody coincidence despite the fact that we meet our eurobond payments these fake rating agencies continue downgrading us companies continue to externalize what they can to squeeze us of foreign exchange and liquidity that is what we pay for privatizing our strategic sector we were insane to sell off assets in a sector that provides 80 of forex to zambia we were literally surrendering the value of the zambian kwacha to monopoly capital who told us to privatize the imf under saps despite copper prices being high we can t give a command to increase mine output to enhance forex because we don t own mines we should never make this mistake in the future we need to create wealth we need to enhance zambian participation in the economy idc and zccm ih should scale up their presence in major companies we need economic freedom russia was paying money to the three rating agencies when the west put sanctions and some russian banks were cut off visa russia also cut ties with foreign companies including these rating agencies but these rating agencies continued rating russia but now in the negative because russia was no longer paying money and also to kill off russia completely the bear however is still alive because the bear owns its own economy so now we are contemplating ongoing on an imf package once that happens we will have little control over our monetary and fiscal policies is that not what they intended in the first place just read this and from now onwards never trust moody s ratings the credit rating agency moody s has agreed to pay nearly 864m to settle with us federal and state authorities over its ratings of risky mortgage securities in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis the department of justice said on friday moody s reached the deal with the justice department 21 states and the district of columbia resolving allegations that the firm contributed to the worst financial crisis since the great depression the department said in a statement the big short is the next financial crisis on its way moody s failed to adhere to its own credit rating standards and fell short on its pledge of transparency in the run up to the great recession principal deputy associate attorney general bill baer said in the statement

rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a higher opening on monday following the modest pullback seen last week the markets may benefit from continued optimism about a u s china trade agreement after a tabloid run by china s ruling communist party discounted negative media reports and said the economic superpowers are very close to a phase one deal china also remains committed to continuing talks for a phase two or even a phase three deal with the united states the state backed global times said on twitter president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping

maturities due to its usefulness in reflecting the market s perceived recession risk a material miss on us consumer confidence data could cause the 2s10s curve to flatten which has already retraced nearly 40 of its steepening since september with the fed shifting away from a dovish approach to monetary policy in favor of a more neutral stance while a disappointing consumer confidence report

the recent round of spontaneous protests against the petrol price hike has to be contextualized as part of the long term revolutionary process in iran the 2017 18 uprisings changed the iranian political landscape for good since then the islamic republic has entered into an organic crisis par excellence introduced and described by the italian marxist antonio gramsci a century ago it is a comprehensive economic political social and ideological crisis in which the ruling classes are no longer able to generate societal consensus in an often quoted phrase of his prison notebooks he writes in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear among the explicit morbid symptoms in the islamic republic are unemployment stagflation currency woes corruption and environmental degradation however there are other tacit symptoms that run through much of the population the youth who are in between immigration and unemployment the students who have lost social aspirations the workers who have been left to themselves and above all the social fabric that is on the verge of disintegration the current round of protests in tens of towns and cities across the country is basically nothing but the continuation of the same socio economic demands that have been put forward in the 2017 18 uprisings at least 106 people have been killed in 21 cities and thousands injured and arrested during the first 3 days there are some unverified speculations on the ground that says it is much more reaching to over 200 slain protesters the government has cut off the internet connectivity with little to be known for the international community this led to some misunderstandings among western spectators with respect to these protests we have to keep several points in mind it is not just about fuel price firstly there is a widespread misunderstanding in the english coverage of the issue that indicates the government has raised fuel prices by 50 percent per liter this is just part of the story the price of rationed gasoline rose 50 percent but on a monthly 60 liters ration for each car over that limit the price rose by 200 percent with devastating effects on the daily lives of people who have already had enough of forty years of a corrupt ruling class secondly many commentators have compared the iranian petrol price to the international one framing the issue as the removal of subsidies instead of increasing the price and hastily concluding that even now it still remains among the world s cheapest what is not understood here is the fact that the iranian minimum wage monthly 125 is not paid in usd not to mention concomitant inflation and the impact on price of other commodities it seems unfair to produce petrol in rials using cheap labor cheap oil etc and sell it in usd in pricing systems it is always a matter of ratio thirdly the gasoline price hike has been justified by the governmental budget deficit while 110 individuals have managed to secure collective facilities totaling 9 2 billion unpaid outstanding loans from iranian banks the decision to hike the petrol price tends to irritate anyone who hear daily news of plunders and lootings by iranian officials and their relatives rather than solicit oligarchic debts to ease budget gaps the islamic republic planned to smash the living conditions of those who barely make ends meet to cover its public spending requirements hiking petrol prices however was the last trigger that sparked the people s anger and has been functioning merely as a pretext to resist the impoverishment of the workers and the lower middle class the fact that the protests were so quickly politicised demonstrates that those suppressed uprisings in 2017 18 did not wane and the islamic republic s organic crisis cannot be resolved within the existing system for those on the streets what is at stake is no longer the fuel prices but forty years of an apartheid regime that has amalgamated varying types of racial and ethnic segregation with sexual religious and class discrimination against women non believers and the underprivileged the political establishment that has ruled iran for the last four decades embodied by reformists and conservatives has failed to address the crisis encompassing the system as a whole it has now appealed to a new old rhetoric of blaming the united states for its current crisis reiterated among many pundits in iran and beyond the fact is however that this organic crisis has its own structural roots embedded in the islamic republic s four decade political economy the us sanctions served as a catalyst for this growing crisis a strident misalliance the very nature of the crisis stems from the misalliance between the political elites who took power immediately after the 1979 revolution and the plutocratic oligarchy that managed to run the country after the eight year iran iraq war soon after the 1979 revolution the religious forces that had taken over monopolized political power and formed a small circle of insiders khodi in opposition to the majority of outsiders these insiders the shia persian male minority approximately 2 300 political personalities have presided over iranian politics for some forty years with every means at their disposal to eliminate every political dissident reaching a peak with the 1988 massacre similarly the iranian economy has been dominated by that plutocratic oligarchy once iran s reconstruction following the 1980 88 war with iraq had been put into practice a tiny economic élite emerged that had strong ties with the political one and overlapped mostly with the ruling classes from ministers and parliament members to clerical judicial and military leaders coupled together the politico economic oligarchy has plundered the whole national resources for decades when it comes to privatization urbanization developmental projects deindustrialization deforestation and banking system the politicians were hand in glove with the economic oligarchy legislations were enacted by parliament members for example to provide their relatives with access to financial resources if the crisis is inscribed on the very construction of the post revolutionary political economy a fundamental deconstruction will be needed indeed the regime is unable to achieve or even forge a consensus within the same old socio political coordinates the 2017 18 uprisings have produced a vacuum in the field of ideological hegemony that is unlikely to be filled in a positive fashion by any of the existing forces in iranian politics crisis of representation the main reason is the interrelated crisis of political representation iranian post revolutionary politics has been so petrified that popular mobilization might spiral out of hand in fact those considered as outsiders have little representational space except for atomized and marginalized cultural activities though the four corners of the country are in turmoil and the workers are fed up with the privatization deregulation and financialization there is no political translation of these socio economic grievances since the 2017 18 uprisings hundreds of protests took place by truckers teachers and workers to mention the three most important ones in late may 2018 thousands of truck drivers in dozens of iranian provinces launched a strike over low wages which gained international support by their fellow travelers in the united states on october 14 15 2018 the first round of a nationwide sit in was held by teachers against the privatization of education and low wages it was followed by the second round of sit ins across the country on november 13 14 that led to the arrest and interrogation of many teachers rights activists finally yet most importantly the successive strikes of workers in haft tappeh sugarcane company in khuzestan province southwest of iran culminated in their last round of strikes with their definitive declaration against privatization their determination to create and institute worker self governed councils shortly after esmail bakhshi the representative of the workers was arrested together with labor activists and workers all of whom were sentenced to a total of 110 years in prison including 14 years in prison and 74 lashes for bakhshi himself simultaneously journalists covering these protests are suffering incarceration under duress in a most recent case marzieh amiri shargh daily economics reporter was arrested on may 1 2019 while she was covering a labor day demonstration in front of the iranian parliament building in tehran and was sentenced consequently to 10 and a half years in prison and 148 lashes the recent round of spontaneous reactions to the petrol price hike has to be contextualized as another indication of the long term revolutionary process in iran this is a multifaceted struggle against on the one hand the compulsory veiling and on the other hand the corruption embezzlement privatization deregulation and the pauperisation of the lower classes all of this has taken place in the absence of political organizations civil society free press parties unions or leaders and now surprisingly even the internet connectivity these are spontaneous initiatives that workers and the lower classes have embarked on jeopardizing their life in order to organize their unions or autonomous assemblies misrepresentation and advertisement amidst the iranian struggle to escape from their far reaching predicament that is the risky exercise of constantly testing and pushing the boundaries of state suppression the morbid symptoms appear also at the level of representation namely the self proclaimed pundits who tend to give the usual regime spin on things during the recent years we have witnessed an increasing amount of interviews op eds articles and so on either from people belonging to the existing élite factions in iran or reflecting their views they have high visibility both in iranian politics and in the western media if journalism is about one thing it is to give voice to those whose voice have never been heard or stifled for some forty years and these voices in today s iran reside in the masses who poured spontaneously onto the streets of nearly 100 cities all around iran in 2017 2018 those who are now fighting on the streets of over 100 towns and cities those who have been injured and arrested during recent days the martyrs who have been killed during three days of protests as well as those who being independent from the super power tutelage can legitimately claim to represent them the only way out of the ongoing grid locked blockage is the formation of a self determining alternative force that rejects any reconfiguration of the islamic republic with a human face by the reformists or centrists a process of transition already in its nascent state from spontaneity to organization if the crisis is a comprehensive organic one the solution would be no less than comprehensive including the emancipation of iranian society in its ideological ethnic gender diversity and above all the iranian women this means that the prevailing economic crisis does not have an economic answer but a political one that is to move beyond the islamic republic toward a radical redistribution of wealth and power it could hopefully lead to the solidarity of the people in the region in lebanon iraq syria and iran to get rid of their life long corrupt leaders via open democracy
last month cnbc 10 7 19 reassured us that fears of a potential recession are overblown because the hard data shows that the us economy remains strong if you ve been keeping track of corporate media coverage of the us economy over the past several years you might have noticed a contradictory pattern you ll find that corporate media make ubiquitous references to a strong economy while simultaneously providing many reports on the increasingly impoverished and precarious working class alongside the continuously rising fortunes of the rich last month a new york times report 10 20 19 exemplified this seemingly bizarre practice when it wondered why so many workers are striking when we apparently live in such a strong economy because the piece also discussed how today s strikes are fueled by a deeper sense of unfairness and economic anxiety even though corporate media are now warning us not to be too complacent because of a potential imminent recession and slowing gdp growth cnn 8 18 19 wall street journal 10 30 19 references to a strong economy and an economic recovery from the great recession still abound three years ago the new york times 12 2 16 remarked that former president barack obama was handing off a strong economy to president donald trump even as it noted that tens of millions of americans understandably feel that the recovery has passed them by two years later times columnist david brooks 11 29 18 led off a column by declaring we re enjoying one of the best economies of our lifetime la times 5 3 19 this year the los angeles times 5 3 19 pondered the two great conundrums of the trump presidency how does his approval rating stay so bad when the economy is so good and what might that forecast about his prospects for reelection politico 10 15 19 and reuters 10 15 19 advise us that election models are forecasting trump s likely reelection based on economic trends in key swing states under his administration as cnn 7 5 19 proclaimed that the strong economy is functioning as trump s safety blanket for his reelection chances the financial times 5 8 19 declared that there is no doubt that the us is the strongest large economy in the world even as it warned that much of the growth surprise appears temporary the strong economy narrative is so thoroughly entrenched the atlantic 8 5 19 observed that even democratic presidential candidates are wary of mentioning economic growth lest it sound like an implicit endorsement of the trump administration s policies however following slower gdp growth and recession forecasts some democratic presidential candidates like joe biden are changing their campaign strategies by claiming that trump is squandering the strong economy inherited from the obama administration reversing their previous view of discussing the strong economic data as a losing electoral strategy reuters 8 22 19 to the extent that there is a debate over the existence of a historic recovery and a strong economy it is largely restricted to whether the economy was better under the obama administration or under the trump administration and over who really deserves credit for this allegedly amazing economy the washington post has run several comparative articles 6 25 18 5 7 19 8 20 19 arguing that trump inherited the strong economy from obama even wondering if this economy is too good to be true while noting that the vital signs look solid cnbc 9 7 18 declared that trump has set economic growth on fire praising a economic boom uniquely his as a tremendous achievement the wall street journal 5 5 19 discussed how a poll found that select groups of americans who disapprove of his job performance are still willing to credit trump for a bustling economy while usa today 7 1 19 discussed a survey that found that the solid economy is doing little to bolster support for president donald trump some articles have pushed back on the idea that trump deserves the credit for the strong economy instead crediting the federal reserve and congress or a vague broader global trend new york times 8 8 19 wall street journal 11 8 17 common dreams 4 29 19 but who determines whether we live in a strong economy and what metrics should we use to find out despite what media say most americans believe that the economic system is rigged to benefit the wealthy elite at the expense of the working class cnn 6 28 16 pew research 10 4 18 common dreams 4 29 19 do the standard economic metrics deployed by corporate journalists accurately capture and explain the feelings and economic situation of most american workers when one also reads the contradictory coverage found in corporate media regarding the precarious situation facing the american working class it s clear they don t here s a nonexhaustive catalog of facts that make elite pundits like the new york times david brooks declaration that we re enjoying one of the best economies of our lifetime appear fatuous and puncture this myth of a strong economy overwhelmingly many of these reports point to gdp growth increased annual spending on total goods and services a low unemployment rate currently at 3 6 and the number of jobs added to the us economy as evidence of a strong economy however the standard unemployment rate in the us only includes people with no job who have been searching for work within the past four weeks this leaves out significant portions of the population like the underemployed and involuntary part time workers those who want full time work but can t find any and discouraged workers who have given up searching for a job quartz 6 7 18 this is why the new york times 10 31 19 found that there are still millions of people not captured in the official unemployment rate and people having trouble finding work in this strong economy the u 6 unemployment rate considered to be more accurate by economists because it includes discouraged workers and part time workers seeking full time employment is 7 almost double the u 3 unemployment rate usually cited by corporate media another figure that complicates this picture of a strong economy is the labor force participation rate the sum of all workers who are employed and actively seeking employment divided by the total working age population the current labor force participation rate is 63 3 4 percentage points lower than the average of 67 3 at the beginning of the 21st century although the number of involuntary part time workers dropped this year even people who only work one hour a week would not be considered unemployed by the bureau of labor statistics a 2016 study by economist lonnie golden found that the number of involuntary part time workers increased almost 45 from 2007 while there has been pushback against a widely cited 2016 study from economists lawrence katz and the late alan krueger which found that 94 of job growth from 2005 to 2015 has been in precarious alternative work arrangements in the gig economy there s no shortage of studies and projections showing that freelancing independent contracting and temp work for corporations like uber are playing a larger role in the us economy without much of the job security and benefits found in more traditional jobs nbc 8 31 17 forbes 2 15 19 new york times 8 22 19 critically throughout several years of reports on this strong economy there have also been numerous reports on the persistent problem of low and stagnant wages although there are reports indicating that workers are finally seeing slightly better wage growth after decades of stagnant wages it s still only a fraction of record corporate profits washington post 11 2 18 the long term trend of wages not keeping up with the prices of essentials hasn t improved much as it s been reported that minimum wage workers can t afford a two bedroom apartment anywhere in the us the economic policy institute 7 19 18 2 5 19 found that if the minimum wage tracked productivity growth since the 1960s it would now be over 20 an hour almost half of us families are unable to afford the basics like rent and food and 40 can t afford an unexpected 400 expense with almost 80 of us workers living paycheck to paycheck perhaps this is why increasing numbers of people are living in poverty in cars and on the streets despite having jobs cbs 7 31 18 new york times 9 11 18 washington post 3 22 19 these low and stagnant wages may also be why americans are increasingly buried in debt as student loan debt reached 1 5 trillion last year exceeding all other forms of consumer debt except mortgages and auto debt is up nearly 40 from the last decade reaching 1 3 trillion wall street journal 8 1 19 one of the grimmest signs that the economy is not working for many is that us life expectancy continues to drop from a peak of 78 9 in 2014 to 78 6 in 2017 the drop is led by rising deaths from suicide drug overdose and alcohol related disease known as diseases of despair among men particularly those without college degrees brookings institution 11 7 19 richard wolff has been one of the few economists who have argued that the media s false recovery hype is a weapon of mass distraction extra 12 14 and observed in capitalism s crisis deepens that the finance industry s decades long wave of spectacular growth has coincided with stagnating wages beginning in the 1970s as more and more americans have to rely on debt to maintain their lifestyle and keep up with the soaring costs of essentials like housing healthcare and higher education historically private debt not public debt is the harbinger of economic disaster contrary to the obsessive focus of media austerity hawks atlantic 9 9 14 guardian 11 4 13 fair org 2 22 19 despite corporate media s ludicrous factchecks on presidential candidate bernie sanders correct claim that three people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of america the washington post argued that the comparison is not especially meaningful because people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have journalists have consistently reported on the reality of rising prosperity of the wealthy record stock markets and soaring corporate profits of course such stories are often presented as good news as if higher stock prices benefited anyone other than people who own stock extra 7 8 02 matt bruenig at the people s policy institute found that the top 1 percent s net worth has increased by 21 trillion while the bottom 50 of the population saw theirs decrease by 900 billion from 1989 to 2018 perhaps this is due to massive criminal tax evasion avoidance by the wealthy and corporations in overseas tax havens euphemistically labeled loopholes coupled with unprecedented tax cuts for the rich alongside relentless selective enforcement and increased taxes on the working class fair org 12 6 17 1 17 18 given all this gdp growth tells us little about how wealth and income are distributed amongst the us population it s theoretically possible for gdp growth to be entirely accounted for by things like increased military spending for a us driven arms race corporations buying back stocks and paying out dividends to further inflate their stock prices instead of giving raises to employees or hiring more of them and the wealthy s environmentally destructive conspicuous consumption of things like private jets and superyachts since all of them count towards gdp journalists shouldn t use gdp as an indicator of economic health without further context because growing gdp alongside skyrocketing income and wealth inequality is not evidence of a strong economy but of a parasitic economy what explains corporate media s credulous reliance on uninformative economic measures and contradictory references to a strong economy alongside reports on a struggling working class it makes little sense if one assumes corporate journalists are primarily concerned with informing the public it makes a great deal of sense when one realizes that corporate news outlets have an inherent interest in cloaking class warfare by equating a strong economy with the prosperity of the investor class even if it comes at the expense of everyone else fair org 10 16 19

u s president donald trump looks on as his nominee for the chairman of the federal reserve jerome powell takes to the podium during a press event in the rose garden at the white house november 2 2017 in washington d c drew angerer getty images in recent years a singular worry has kept washington s economic policymakers awake at night turning japanese few outcomes spook them more than falling into a cycle of stagnation and falling prices that conventional tools can t reverse could it be that the real threat is turning chinese it s hard not to wonder given the personalities u s president donald trump is tapping for the federal reserve most recently they include judy shelton a conservative scholar making the case against the independence that s made the fed so potent and largely successful these last 106 years the fed remember was designed to be the opposite of an atm for the party in power unlike its chinese counterpart shelton follows trump pick stephen moore a television commentator who lobbied for the job reading more from the people s bank of china playbook than adam smith s thankfully moore s nomination for the fed board went down in flames after past comments including retrograde ones on gender came to light yet he s just one of a number of trump fed picks chosen more for obsequiousness than pertinent qualifications of course trump s fiscal side appointees bear a striking resemblance to the communist party apparatchiks rubber stamping beijing s worst impulses trump s yes man of a treasury secretary stephen mnuchin has shrouded one of the globe s most trusted and transparent institutions in a mao like fog lawrence kudlow spent decades championing free markets now he advises a white house making china seem like a protector of capitalism as america courts developing nationhood yet it s trump assault of the fed that s likely to do the most lasting economic damage trump s fiscal policies wreckage that they are could be addressed by the next president assuming a new one is elected in november 2020 while reducing the 23 trillion national debt achieved on trump s watch or 1 trillion in annual deficits won t be easy it s doable restoring trust in the fed the linchpin of global finance not so much what makes shelton s comments so concerning is that they re not a bug but a feature the way trump has gone after chairman jerome powell is to borrow a word the president has used to characterize his own hand picked fed leader crazy and doesn t asia know it this region holds more u s treasury securities than any other japan and china alone own a combined 2 3 trillion of the iou s powell s team is supposed to be safeguarding trump summoned powell to a nov 18 meeting later tweeting that they discussed negative interest easing and dollar strength all code for the fed needs to cut rates back to zero and beyond of course u s rates are already negative by some measures inflation for example rose at a 1 8 pace in october at a moment when 10 year treasury yields are 1 7 sure powell s team could cut its benchmark rate from the current range of 1 5 to 1 75 but in a world of zero rates from tokyo to frankfurt all that might do is boost stocks at the risk of undermining trust in the dollar that s fine with trump so long as he wins reelection and it s no coincidence that his team is actively seeking voices like shelton s who see the fed s role more as rubber stamp for the white house than credible monetary authority judy shelton u s executive director for the european bank for reconstruction and development speaks during a bloomberg television interview in washington d c andrew harrer bloomberg i don t see any reference to independence in the legislation that has defined the role of the federal reserve for the united states shelton was recently quoted as saying by bloomberg she goes on to say that it s not considered inappropriate at the time for everyone to be working together to achieve mutually agreed goals that would benefit the american people this will sound quintessentially japanese to monetary historians since 1999 after all the bank of japan has held rates near or sharply below zero under governor haruhiko kuroda on the job since 2013 the boj went further than ever it cornered the bond market with trillions of dollars of purchases and dominated the stock market via massive stakes in exchange traded funds those moves helped weaken the yen by 30 yet prime minister shinzo abe would love for kuroda s team to go much much further even so abe and his finance minister taro aso have been rather hands off toward the boj in public comments it s allowed the boj to perverse at least some veneer of autonomy and institutional dignity trump s approach has a decidedly total allegiance vibe since picking powell in 2017 trump routinely attacked him as a bonehead and an enemy of the country trump has reportedly even broached the idea of firing powell earlier this month trump tweeted the fed puts us at a competitive disadvantage china is not our problem the federal reserve is adding that u s rates should be below those of japan germany and all others of course trump really is talking about china here even inside his maga bubble trump can see that his trade war is backfiring president xi jinping hasn t been the easy mark trump assumed and farmers and manufacturers in u s states trump needs to win for re election are getting slammed by his china tariffs the fed trump hopes can save the day in the nick of time powell s fed has already eased three times this year and seems unlikely to bow to trump s broadsides for one thing he and predecessor janet yellen worked hard since 2015 to normalize u s borrowing costs cutting rates to zero after the 2008 global crisis was the monetary equivalent of cpr it was never meant to remain in place in 20 years later that s japan s mistake of course by failing to normalize the relationship between money and risk japan continues to stagger along requiring ever more stimulus to keep growth positive it s an error that chinese officials are trying to avoid it remains an open question that they can there s great irony though in trump s china ization gamble by demanding absolute authority over the fed and trying to load it with rubber stamping apparatchiks trump is going the full mao on the world s most important financial institution the only thing trump is likely to make great here is the magnitude of the crisis when global investors get fed up with his antics

antimonopoly and the democrats antimonopoly and the democrats the antimonopoly tradition once contributed to mobilization coalition building and sustained reform across the liberal left spectrum and it might do so again today bettmann getty images democrats are waking up to the realities of economic power less than a decade ago the subject was taboo even with the economy in ruins democratic leadership saw no option beyond neoliberalism but since the 2016 primaries a split has opened up in the party with it has come a resurgence of antimonopoly politics that neoliberal leaders can no longer ignore at first blush it looks like antimonopoly heightens the conflict between socialists committed to overcoming capitalism and establishment centrists seeking to save it from populist attacks on the left and right but antimonopoly once contributed to mobilization coalition building and sustained reform across the liberal left spectrum and it might do so again today the antimonopoly tradition democracy and markets are fragile and demanding systems easily corrupted by formidable concentrations of power the antimonopoly tradition recognizes this fragility and it makes no sharp distinction between economic and political power excessive concentrations of political power undermine economic prosperity no less than excessive concentrations of economic power corrupt democracy the problem for law and public policy in a democracy with markets seems simple how to check the constant tendency to concentrated power there s no clear cut way to do that because those who seek to attain power and lock in privilege are endlessly inventive under the right conditions institutions designed to check power can be used to opposite ends as a result antimonopoly is far more than an ideology it is a political project that requires vigilance action and constant adaptation reformers have drawn on the antimonopoly tradition which is far more wide ranging than just antitrust a set of policies designed to prevent predatory competition and break up concentrations of economic power throughout u s history in the 1830s jacksonians used it to authorize privatization dismantling the second bank of the united states because it locked in the privilege of an overweening aristocracy abolitionists in the 1840s and 1850s drew on the antimonopoly tradition to dismantle the slave power in the 1880s populists enacted state antitrust laws to check the growth of corporate power in the first decades of the twentieth century progressives went further breaking up corporate power and boosting countervailing forces in government unions and proprietary enterprise in the new deal the antimonopoly tradition broke the power of banks and industrial corporations and paved the way for regulation collective bargaining and welfare provision in the 1940s liberals drew on it to outlaw discriminatory pricing and check the predatory power of chain stores in the 1950s and 1960s antitrust administrators broke up patent monopolies opening the way to high technology the antimonopoly tradition as this sketch demonstrates has enabled diverse political projects in the first gilded age it provided a challenge to laissez faire constitutionalism the legal doctrine that markets were autonomous from politics and that property and contracts always protected individual liberty in today s gilded age the antimonopoly tradition confronts market fundamentalism the belief that liberty is best realized in market transactions insulated from democratic interference that it is possible to organize markets effectively without government supervision and that we ought not worry about concentrations of economic power either because they are efficient or temporary the turn to market fundamentalism had a major impact on the practice of antitrust severing it from its roots in the antimonopoly tradition the university of chicago trained lawyer robert bork who published the antitrust paradox in 1978 convinced reagan s justice department that antitrust blocked efficient forms of business organization left alone corporations and capital markets could decide better than government regulators whether mergers hostile takeovers outsourcing or breaking up and selling off corporate assets would serve consumers if the result was concentrated power so be it in time the democrats agreed that the only goal of antitrust was to protect consumers by 1992 antitrust had disappeared from their platform for the first time in a century the resurgence of the antimonopoly tradition among democrats indicates a sea change in how they approach economic governance rather than limiting debate to after the fact redistribution they have begun to ask how markets and business organizations can be structured to check concentrations of power many democrats are converging on a platform to rebuild a more democratic economy even as they disagree in fundamental ways over what that means who should benefit and how to achieve it still the antimonopoly tradition s shared appeal could open new possibilities for party politics and reform this might seem overly optimistic but a closer look at how the antimonopoly tradition has informed three ideological factions within the democratic party democratic socialists neo liberals and antimonopolists proper illustrates the potential for a broader politics focused on challenging concentrated power and building a more democratic economy democratic socialists the antimonopoly tradition has already seeped into contemporary democratic socialist politics from bernie sanders s presidential campaign to the movement for black lives and the green new deal socialists have combined the antimonopoly tradition with class analysis in a mixture fertile for reform on its face the antimonopoly tradition seems at odds with socialism why improve markets when they are the site of labor exploitation why promote competition when it drives down labor and environmental standards worldwide isn t the resurgence of antitrust yet another effort to save capitalism and coopt the socialist left all of this might be true if contemporary socialists conceived of socialism as a uniform system of public ownership of the means of production but although they seek to decommodify critical areas of economic life healthcare education and housing many socialists advocate a mixture of economic forms strong unions co determination labor councils employee stock ownership plans cooperatives credit unions family farms and community land trusts where public ownership is not a clear substitute for private economic power many socialists have turned to the antimonopoly tradition to destabilize and prevent that power from accumulating consider socialist proposals for banking many prominent democratic socialists support a return to glass steagall a classically antimonopoly solution to corporate power rather than public ownership of banking as supreme court justice louis brandeis wrote in other people s money and how bankers use it in 1914 allowing bankers to speculate on the savings of depositors was a conflict of interest it fostered excessive risk tasking turned banking into a casino enriched a small elite and divided the interests of wall street from main street the framers of glass steagall hoped to check these tendencies in the aftermath of the financial crisis sanders called not to nationalize banks that were too big to fail but to break them up the opposite he argues has occurred the bailouts and the dodd frank act made banks bigger fewer and more powerful socialists combine antimonopoly analysis of banking with class based anti racist and communitarian action black communities for example cannot be revitalized without a national credit fund and policies to support locally owned and run black banks worker owned enterprise cooperatives and geographically rooted enterprise cannot thrive without renewed attention to community development and rural banks local credit unions and revolving credit funds socialists acknowledge that none of these alternatives are possible or sustainable without checking the power of the largest financial institutions in the first instance socialists have a similar approach to agricultural policy sanders s plan to revitalize rural america combines class and antimonopoly analysis the monopolization of agriculture reads his plan has devastated family farms and rural communities in pork production alone consolidation resulted in an 82 percent decline in the number of hog farms in iowa between 1982 and 2007 worse still corporate agriculture has turned formerly independent farmers into a dependent class through an exploitative system of vertical integration dominant meatpackers and chicken processors have taken ownership of livestock they let out contracts to ranchers and farmers to raise it for cut rate prices under rules that foist cost and risk onto the producer machinery monopolies make it illegal to for farmers to repair their own equipment chemical giants routinely sue farmers for breach of patents the first line of defense in sanders s plan is not public or collective ownership but to enact and enforce roosevelt style trust busting laws to stop monopolization of markets and break up existing massive agribusiness place a moratorium on future mergers of large agribusiness corporations and break up existing massive agribusinesses and enforce rules against exploitive vertical contracts the goal of these antitrust policies is not to unleash the free market but to ensure that farmers receive fair prices and share risks with packers processors wholesalers retailers and consumers this mixture of checks on the power of corporations and fair pricing among smaller producers is what brandeis called regulated competition the goal is to channel rivalry away from the sorts of predatory tactics enacted by big meatpackers into improvements in production processes and products like the green new deal which promises to ensure a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies sanders s plan promises to improve production by working with farmers and ranchers to remove greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture liberals liberals have also begun to draw on the antimonopoly tradition among the current democratic presidential candidates amy klobuchar is the best example of this tendency a proud student of robert bork klobuchar is the ranking member of the subcommittee on antitrust competition policy and consumer rights of the senate judiciary committee for all klobuchar s commitment to make antitrust cool again she worked hard to keep it walled off from the antimonopoly tradition until very recently in 2016 klobuchar introduced two bills to improve antitrust administration the first made it easier to block mergers that increased consumer prices lowered product quality excluded competitors undermined innovation or unfairly lowered prices and shifted the burden of proof from the state to corporations proposing mergers the second bill co sponsored by nine democrats was designed to improve federal trade commission ftc and department of justice doj capacities to serve consumers at the open markets institute where barry lynn and his colleagues have sounded the siren on monopoly power for more than a decade klobuchar s proposals were met with appreciative skepticism they raised consciousness but perpetuated the failed 1980s idea that the purpose of antimonopoly law is to protect consumers antitrust law they insisted was written to serve a variety of political economic goals primary among these being the defense of democratic institutions from consolidations of power and the defense of the market structures that promote the distribution of opportunity and wealth more recently klobuchar has rekindled the antimonopoly tradition monopoly power she now admits can oppress workers and subcontractors even if consumers are served by low prices liberals call this sort of economic domination monopsony or buying power klobuchar has promised to scrutinize it as much as consumer domination and to press for antitrust action in two industries where a small number of powerful corporations have suppressed wages and labor unions airlines and rails klobuchar is not the only democratic liberal cautiously revisiting the antimonopoly tradition neoliberals like hillary clinton and virginia senator mark warner have begun to see monopoly power as an obstacle to their cherished motors of economic growth entrepreneurship and technological innovation where they once blamed democracy and regulation for economic stagnation they have begun to ask how monopolists use their deep pockets and political power to suppress entrepreneurship competition and technological responses to pressing problems like poverty and climate change during the 2016 campaign clinton complained not only that monopolists exacted excessively high prices on pharmaceuticals air travel and internet access she highlighted how they suppressed wages blocked start ups and killed innovative small competitors she promised to stop corporate concentration anywhere it unfairly limits competition to close loopholes in the law that protect incumbent businesses to direct the doj and the ftc to study the relationship between market consolidation and stagnating incomes and to beef up antitrust enforcement even joe biden no critic of economic power in the senate has expressed his support for more aggressive antitrust enforcement like sanders his plan for rural america promises to protect small and medium sized farmers and ranchers from the power of chemical packing and seed monopolies though biden has yet to fulfill his promise to roll out an antitrust plan it is hard to imagine he will produce one weaker than clinton s in the current political climate antimonopolists for some democrats like elizabeth warren and her allies in the open markets institute the antimonopoly tradition is so central to their politics that they may be thought of as antimonopolists they have led the drive to bring antimonopoly tradition back into democratic party politics at the time of the bank bailout and the passage of the dodd frank act it was warren who first said that if the nine largest banks were too big to fail they should be broken up and among party leaders it was warren who argued most forcefully that the repeal of glass steagall under clinton had contributed to the financial crisis warren is an antimonopolist who loves markets she is a is a lawyer who unlike the clintons and klobuchar resisted indoctrination by bork s law and economics movement although she flirted with these ideas early in her career studying bankruptcy convinced her that reality is a lot messier than these theories the majority of people who declared bankruptcy she learned were thrown into turmoil by health issues unemployment or personal crisis not because they were reckless borrowers studying bankruptcy moreover revealed the larger problem of the vast expansion of consumer credit to compensate for stagnant wages just as progressive legal realists developed a critique of labor contracts a century before warren came to view credit contracts as corrupted by structural inequalities lenders exploited their power to deceive and manipulate borrowers collude among themselves and threaten delinquents warren s conclusions placed her in opposition to the powerful alliance of conservative legal scholars foundations and the financial services industry she debated bankruptcy law with the dean of the chicago law school and fought the credit card industry s efforts to tighten bankruptcy restrictions appointed by congress to monitor the bank bailout in 2008 warren saw political corruption predatory business behavior and monopoly power everywhere she looked like progressive era antimonopolists before her warren insists that markets are not self regulating entities autonomous from law and politics markets either have good rules or bad rules either enforced or unenforced the design and enforcement of these rules make markets more or less egalitarian in more egalitarian markets people are likely to make bargains that made them better off power is more likely to be temporary and less likely to corrupt politics in autocratic markets theft becomes legitimate and might makes right if structural inequalities undermine the good markets can do and corrupts politics then it is not enough say to improve the ftc s capacity to monitor amazon as liberal technocrats suggest amazon amassed and locks in its power by serving as a platform for its vendors and as a competitor to them it monitors their successes copies them and then favors its own subsidiaries until it drives competitors into the ground when warren says break up amazon she means it should not be allowed to be a platform for other businesses and a competitor against them simultaneously the antimonopoly tradition acknowledges the inventiveness of the powerful that means it is necessary to build countervailing power in the state and civil society if congress outlaws mortgages or credit cards whose interest rates can be raised without notice lenders will invent new predatory instruments hence the need for a consumer finance agency to monitor fraudulent behavior cory booker a child of the black petit bourgeoisie has also expressed antimonopolist convictions he watched his parents funeral home get driven out of business by predatory competition from corporate chains the same story he notes can be told for black banks insurance companies and retailers unlike warren who came to antimonpolism through professional conviction booker came to it the way many americans have historically through concrete experiences of predatory competition which threatened livelihoods communities independence and in his case racial self determination common ground while history has convinced me that antimonopolists better understand the development of u s political economy than either marxists or liberals it has also convinced me that every political project has its blind spots antimonopoly and liberal politics do not address class sufficiently socialist proposals are mostly unconcerned about innovation liberals are far too complacent about power each also has its strengths socialists show us how monopoly power oppresses labor liberals how it impedes innovation and public problem solving and antimonopolists how we can use existing legal and cultural resources to counter concentrated power and build a more democratic economy the antimonopoly tradition has energized a wide spectrum of people in the orbit of the democratic party combined with other political projects it can help mobilize young people small business minority voters non college whites in the midwest and rural voters it is a mistake to gag any version of it because doing so has the potential to suppress mobilization across the diverse coalition that is the only weapon democrats have against the republican party democrats at war with themselves would do well to keep the antimonopoly tradition s focus on power and building a more democratic economy in mind independently and together sometimes this will necessitate vigorous debate at other times it will necessitate tolerance sometimes it will mean the same reforms such as reinvigorating glass steagall will be interpreted differently by factions engaged in different political projects and sometimes it will mean surprising collaborations like the one between bernie sanders and chuck schumer to regulate corporate stock buybacks for socialists liberals and antimonopolists alike reinvigorating the antimonopoly tradition will require more than just words otherwise mistrust will fester socialists will have to support some policies that favor entrepreneurship liberals will have to stand up to powerful donors who will be subject to antitrust action antimonopolists will have to accept some solutions to monopoly power besides antitrust such as public ownership or utility regulation a democratic party that figures out how to use the antimonopoly tradition to forge a durable coalition

presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free that s popular among voters especially those struggling to pay off this debt other democratic candidates have more modest plans but economists say the dramatic proposals from sanders and warren to free millions of americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality warren would forgive up to 50 000 for most people sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness but with these plans having a price tag north of 1 trillion such legislation would come with plenty of risks the reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans children it s not about if you want them says laura greenwood in montpelier vt it s about can you afford them greenwood works for the state

plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board this would be expensive foster says americans owe a lot of money on those student loans about 1 5 trillion and that s more than auto loans and credit cards they re the second biggest debt item for households foster says most of these loans are from the federal government and it could forgive them but that would mean giving up the 85 billion in annual revenue it s currently collecting on these loans and he says that would result in a wider fiscal deficit also taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come

probably wouldn t want to tax the working class to pay for higher income college graduates loan forgiveness that s why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it which by the way foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people s spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets foster says there could also be what s called a moral hazard factor here for future students those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they ll take out even more money than they might have otherwise that could create even greater levels of student debt so there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this but policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to

says there could also be what s called a moral hazard factor here for future students those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they ll take out even more money than they might have otherwise that could create even greater levels of student debt so there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this but policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn t have to take on so much debt copyright 2021 npr to see more

presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free that s popular among voters especially those struggling to pay off this debt other democratic candidates have more modest plans but economists say the dramatic proposals from sanders and warren to free millions of americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality warren would forgive up to 50 000 for most people sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness but with these plans having a price tag north of 1 trillion such legislation would come with plenty of risks the reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans children it s not about if you want them says laura greenwood in montpelier vt it s about can you afford them greenwood works for the state education agency she s 30 years old and makes 63 000 a year i make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers courtesy of laura greenwood courtesy of laura greenwood laura greenwood in montpelier vt says she can t afford to start a family because of her student loan debt but after paying for college and grad school greenwood owes 96 000 in student loans and she says that s got her and her partner feeling frozen yeah it s always we re interested in having kids but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans it s just like the final straw she says it makes starting a family feel impossible so if people like greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks it stands to reason that would unleash pent up desires and spending that would be good for the economy a lot more people would have kids or start businesses or buy houses in the short term it would be very positive for the housing market says lawrence yun the national association of realtors chief economist he says his group s surveysshow that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years he s not endorsing any particular plan but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit home sales could be say 300 000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt yun says that would be a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy the effects would go beyond the housing market william foster is a vice president with moody s which just did a report on student debt forgiveness there ve been some estimates that u s real gdp could be boosted on average by 86 billion to 108 billion per year which is quite a bit he says that s if you had total loan forgiveness foster says it wouldn t have to be total forgiveness to see significant results and he says it could also help address rising income inequality student loans are now contributing to what s perceived as lower economic prospects for younger americans foster says after all millions of people are delaying homeownership and that s the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth a typical homeowner has net worth about 230 000 while a typical renter has only 5 000 yun says but while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing it would not be free and this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board this would be expensive foster says americans owe a lot of money on those student loans about 1 5 trillion and that s more than auto loans and credit cards they re the second biggest debt item for households foster says most of these loans are from the federal government and it could forgive them but that would mean giving up the 85 billion in annual revenue it s currently collecting on these loans and he says that would result in a wider fiscal deficit also taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come

make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn t have to take on so much debt copyright 2021 npr to see more

presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free that s popular among voters especially those struggling to pay off this debt other democratic candidates have more modest plans but economists say the dramatic proposals from sanders and warren to free millions of americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality warren would forgive up to 50 000 for most people sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness but with these plans having a price tag north of 1 trillion such legislation would come with plenty of risks the reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans children it s not about if you want them says laura greenwood in montpelier vt it s about can you afford them greenwood works for the state education agency she s 30 years old and makes 63 000 a year i make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers courtesy of laura greenwood courtesy of laura greenwood laura greenwood in montpelier vt says she can t afford to start a family because of her student loan debt but after paying for college and grad school greenwood owes 96 000 in student loans and she says that s got her and her partner feeling frozen yeah it s always we re interested in having kids but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans it s just like the final straw she says it makes starting a family feel impossible so if people like greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks it stands to reason that would unleash pent up desires and spending that would be good for the economy a lot more people would have kids or start businesses or buy houses in the short term it would be very positive for the housing market says lawrence yun the national association of realtors chief economist he says his group s surveysshow that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years he s not endorsing any particular plan but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit home sales could be say 300 000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt yun says that would be a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy the effects would go beyond the housing market william foster is a vice president with moody s which just did a report on student debt forgiveness there ve been some estimates that u s real gdp could be boosted on average by 86 billion to 108 billion per year which is quite a bit he says that s if you had total loan forgiveness foster says it wouldn t have to be total forgiveness to see significant results and he says it could also help address rising income inequality student loans are now contributing to what s perceived as lower economic prospects for younger americans foster says after all millions of people are delaying homeownership and that s the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth a typical homeowner has net worth about 230 000 while a typical renter has only 5 000 yun says but while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing it would not be free and this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board this would be expensive foster says americans owe a lot of money on those student loans about 1 5 trillion and that s more than auto loans and credit cards they re the second biggest debt item for households foster says most of these loans are from the federal government and it could forgive them but that would mean giving up the 85 billion in annual revenue it s currently collecting on these loans and he says that would result in a wider fiscal deficit also taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about and there are other issues many people would oppose a giveaway to say lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt and you probably wouldn t want to tax the working class to pay for higher income college graduates loan forgiveness that s why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it which by the way foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people s spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets foster says there could also be what s called a moral hazard factor here for future students those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they ll take out even more money than they might

presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free that s popular among voters especially those struggling to pay off this debt other democratic candidates have more modest plans but economists say the dramatic proposals from sanders and warren to free millions of americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality warren would forgive up to 50 000 for most people sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness but with these plans having a price tag north of 1 trillion such legislation would come with plenty of risks the reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans children it s not about if you want them says laura greenwood in montpelier vt it s about can you afford them greenwood works for the state education agency she s 30 years old and makes 63 000 a year i make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers courtesy of laura greenwood courtesy of laura greenwood laura greenwood in montpelier vt says she can t afford to start a family because of her student loan debt but after paying for college and grad school greenwood owes 96 000 in student loans and she says that s got her and her partner feeling frozen yeah it s always we re interested in having kids but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans it s just like the final straw she says it makes starting a family feel impossible so if people like greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks it stands to reason that would unleash pent up desires and spending that would be good for the economy a lot more people would have kids or start businesses or buy houses in the short term it would be very positive for the housing market says lawrence yun the national association of realtors chief economist he says his group s surveysshow that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years he s not endorsing any particular plan but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit home sales could be say 300 000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt yun says that would be a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy the effects would go beyond the housing market william foster is a vice president with moody s which just did a report on student debt forgiveness there ve been some estimates that u s real gdp could be boosted on average by 86 billion to 108 billion per year which is quite a bit he says that s if you had total loan forgiveness foster says it wouldn t have to be total forgiveness to see significant results and he says it could also help address rising income inequality student loans are now contributing to what s perceived as lower economic prospects for younger americans foster says after all millions of people are delaying homeownership and that s the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth a typical homeowner has net worth about 230 000 while a typical renter has only 5 000 yun says but while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing it would not be free and this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board this would be expensive foster says americans owe a lot of money on those student loans about 1 5 trillion and that s more than auto loans and credit cards they re the second biggest debt item for households foster says most of these loans are from the federal government and it could forgive them but that would mean giving up the 85 billion in annual revenue it s currently collecting on these loans and he says that would result in a wider fiscal deficit also taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about and there are other issues many people would oppose a giveaway to say lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt and you probably wouldn t want to tax the working class to pay for higher income college graduates loan forgiveness that s why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it which by the way foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people s spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets foster says there could also be what s called a moral hazard factor here for future students those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they ll take out even more money than they might have otherwise that could create even greater levels of student debt so there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this but policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn t have to take on so much debt copyright 2021 npr to see more

presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free that s popular among voters especially those struggling to pay off this debt other democratic candidates have more modest plans but economists say the dramatic proposals from sanders and warren to free millions of americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality warren would forgive up to 50 000 for most people sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness but with these plans having a price tag north of 1 trillion such legislation would come with plenty of risks the reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans children it s not about if you want them says laura greenwood in montpelier vt it s about can you afford them greenwood works for the state education agency she s 30 years old and makes 63 000 a year i make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers courtesy of laura greenwood courtesy of laura greenwood laura greenwood in montpelier vt says she can t afford to start a family because of her student loan debt but after paying for college and grad school greenwood owes 96 000 in student loans and she says that s got her and her partner feeling frozen yeah it s always we re interested in having kids but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans it s just like the final straw she says it makes starting a family feel impossible so if people like greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks it stands to reason that would unleash pent up desires and spending that would be good for the economy a lot more people would have kids or start businesses or buy houses in the short term it would be very positive for the housing market says lawrence yun the national association of realtors chief economist he says his group s surveysshow that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years he s not endorsing any particular plan but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit home sales could be say 300 000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt yun says that would be a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy the effects would go beyond the housing market william foster is a vice president with moody s which just did a report on student debt forgiveness there ve been some estimates that u s real gdp could be boosted on average by 86 billion to 108 billion per year which is quite a bit he says that s if you had total loan forgiveness foster says it wouldn t have to be total forgiveness to see significant results and he says it could also help address rising income inequality student loans are now contributing to what s perceived as lower economic prospects for younger americans foster says after all millions of people are delaying homeownership and that s the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth a typical homeowner has net worth about 230 000 while a typical renter has only 5 000 yun says but while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing it would not be free and this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board this would be expensive foster says americans owe a lot of money on those student loans about 1 5 trillion and that s more than auto loans and credit cards they re the second biggest debt item for households foster says most of these loans are from the federal government and it could forgive them but that would mean giving up the 85 billion in annual revenue it s currently collecting on these loans and he says that would result in a wider fiscal deficit also taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about and there are other issues many people would oppose a giveaway to say lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt and you probably wouldn t want to tax the working class to pay for higher income college graduates loan forgiveness that s why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it which by the way foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people s spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets foster says there could also be what s called a moral hazard factor here for future students those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they ll take out even more money than they might have otherwise that could create even greater levels of student debt so there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this but policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to

the economic landscape before us continues to look like something out of alice and the looking glass a bizarre and unrecognizable land a land that is distorted and papered over by ream after ream of paper for over a decade this paper has been rolling off the printing presses of central banks all across the world in an attempt to mask reality peter schiff says printing money is to the economy what taking drugs is to a drug addict in the short term it makes the economy feel good but in the long run it is much worse off unfortunately what was once the long run or distant future is now getting much closer many people are now set to blame any slowdown in global growth on what has been declared a very dangerous and protracted trade war going into it many economists warned it could be truly disastrous for the entire global economy in my opinion the fear of slowing trade and how it will affect america is being overplayed and is not the chief catalyst for a slowdown here in america while it is easy to target trade as the culprit and trump as the instigator this conclusion is not supported by facts we should remember the economy moves in cycles and this one is long in the tooth by historical standards since the bernanke experiment began time and time again the green shoots of economic growth have withered and required more stimulus in order to move to the next level each prediction of achieving escape velocity has proven to be short lived or overly optimistic these bursts of good news have continually been followed by disappointing economic data forcing some kind of stimulus to get the economy over the next hurdle when all is said and done i expect economists will argue for decades over whether bernanke indeed took us down the wrong path because easy money allows us to ignore important problems when it comes to the economy we are not talking about a well oiled and designed machine and in the end we may find that events are not completely under the control of those who have been placed in the driver s seat we have just been through an expansion in credit and the monetary base of a magnitude never before witnessed in modern times the influx of monetary stimulus from qe and massive government deficit spending has created the illusion of more pent up demand than exists or can be substantiated this has resulted in an elevated baseline for comparing year on year growth in short we have to move forward faster next year just to keep growing for example if we manufacture and sell twelve million automobiles this year up from ten million because of low interest rates and easy money we now must sell the same number for the economy not to contract this means the bar is constantly being lifted and we must sell even more next year in order to move forward the whole concept of economic growth is based on an ever growing trend of year over year increased production click to enlarge the bad news is that even after the latest wave of fresh stimulus global growth is again starting to drop according to the oecd s latest report on the economic outlook the report from the paris based policy forum titled weak trade and investment threaten long term growth paints a bleak picture of what s to come the world economy is quickly decelerating after peaking at 3 5 in 2018 going forward the global gdp is expected to grow at a decade low of only 2 9 this year and remain in the range of 2 9 to 3 through 2021 throughout history new trends and inventions have emerged shaking things up and propelling growth also we have become accustomed to what is known as sector rotation such as computer sales increase when clothing falls but overall we seek numbers that reflect an upward and onward slope history shows that such trends falter when they become overdone and become a headwind for growth central bank action coupled with massive government spending in recent years has acted as an artificial tailwind but this is not a normal state which can be sustained so the question is what happens after the momentum ends after qe can no longer increase demand after most or all of this easy money has flowed into the investment of the day what happens when it begins to flow out the problem is this so called recovery has been constructed on the unstable base of false demand and debt it is not uncommon to see debt sour when the economy slows and this can rapidly occur time has a way of revealing certain realities but does so at its own choosing while we tend to think that we will see it coming and have ample time to react if it becomes apparent the markets are about to crash the speed at which events can occur is often a surprise many people have come to accept the fact the world might soon witness a major shift in the value of one investment over another as investors seek firmer ground derivatives currencies plunging stock prices air rushing out of a bond market bubble how debts are structured and the timing or direction from which problems arise are all factors that must be considered investors are constantly reminded that investing involves risk investing in foreign markets is subject to additional risk including currency fluctuations this means we face the loss of principal or capital year after year of climbing markets tends to make people complacent and that is where we are original post editor s note the

a pedestrian walks past the federal reserve building on constitution avenue in washington on march 19 2019 leah millis reuters federal reserve economists warn that printing money to pay for deficit spending has been a disaster for other nations that have tried it in a paper that discusses the burgeoning u s fiscal debt fed experts note that high levels are not necessarily unsustainable so long as income is rising at a faster pace they note that countries that have gotten into trouble and looked to central banks to bail them out haven t fared well a solution some countries with high levels of unsustainable debt have tried is printing money in this scenario the government borrows money by issuing bonds and then orders the central bank to buy those bonds by creating printing money wrote scott a wolla and kaitlyn frerking history has taught us however that this type of policy leads to extremely high rates of inflation hyperinflation and often ends in economic ruin watch now they cite weimar era germany zimbabwe in the 2007 09 period and venezuela currently all three faced massive deficits that led to hyperinflation due to money printing an important protection against this type of policy is to create an independent central bank that is insulated from the political process and has clear objectives such as a specific target for the inflation rate so that it can make policy decisions to sustain economic health over the long run rather than respond to political pressures the economists added the paper never specifically mentions modern monetary theory though the approach it describes meshes with central tenets of the mmt approach the fed analysis does reference a paper on mmt in a sidebar box on monetary owls as opposed to hawks who are against deficits and doves who don t care as much about them the owls according to the authors suggest that a government that controls a fiat money system is not constrained because it can simply create more money to pay its debts deficit spending as an investment

as lower economic prospects for younger americans foster says after all millions of people are delaying homeownership and that s the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth a typical homeowner has net worth about 230 000 while a typical renter has only 5 000 yun says but while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing it would not be free and this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board this would be expensive foster says americans owe a lot of money on those student loans about 1 5 trillion and that s more than auto loans and credit cards they re the second biggest debt item for households foster says most of these loans are from the federal government and it could forgive them but that would mean giving up the 85 billion in annual revenue it s currently collecting on these loans and he says that would result in a wider fiscal deficit also taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about and there are other issues many people would oppose a giveaway to say lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt and you probably wouldn t want to tax the working class to pay for higher income college graduates loan forgiveness that s why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it which by the way foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people s spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets foster says there could also be what s called a moral hazard factor here for future students those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they ll take out even more money than they might have otherwise that could create even greater levels of student debt so there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this but policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn t have to take on so much debt copyright 2021 npr to see more

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story east hartford connecticut ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell normally spends his days in the marble halls of washington meeting with senators and fed economists on monday he learned about the job market from an 18 year old named jasmine a recent high school graduate jasmine ayala explained to powell how she has just landed a good job as a laser operator at aircraft engine manufacturer pratt whitney after graduation she received seven weeks of training backed by a grant from a local nonprofit called east hartford connects it was an amazing opportunity ayala said her exchange with the chairman of the world s most powerful central bank came during a visit powell paid monday to a hardscrabble neighborhood of east hartford the trip included a neighborhood tour and a meeting with residents to get an up front look at their challenges monday s events are part of an ongoing outreach by the powell fed to representatives of labor unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress one major reason for that is the existence of training programs like the one that helped ayala since becoming chairman nearly two years ago powell has sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies low interest rates generally help sustain a solid job market which in turn can encourage job training efforts as unemployment has reached a nearly a 50 year low of 3 6 more employers are taking more chances on young people without college degrees and are training them we try to create a strong labor market but for some it s not enough powell said after residents told of vital help they have received from east hartford connects including child support assistance that allowed them to re enter the job market they need to be given a chance the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with unemployment low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed what i sense is different is that he sees those benefits to workers as so important that he is less willing to lose those benefits to quell phantom inflation said tim duy an economist at the university of oregon powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change has been the outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labor day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chair spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further in east hartford s school system nearly half the students are latino chela gage director of talent acquisition at pratt whitney which is based in east hartford said the persistence of low unemployment has led the company to think more creatively about hiring we are stretching our arms to see where the talent lies she said ayala was working part time while still in high school applying make up at weddings and other events for 10 10 an hour that income helped her family and she wasn t sure she could have given it up for training without the stipend she received her new job at pratt whitney pays 29 an hour she s also attending school at night to earn her bachelor s degree things don t happen unless you work hard she said j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but people didn t want to acknowledge it copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free that s popular among voters especially those struggling to pay off this debt other democratic candidates have more modest plans but economists say the dramatic proposals from sanders and warren to free millions of americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality warren would forgive up to 50 000 for most people sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness but with these plans having a price tag north of 1 trillion such legislation would come with plenty of risks the reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans children it s not about if you want them says laura greenwood in montpelier vt it s about can you afford them greenwood works for the state education agency she s 30 years old and makes 63 000 a year i make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers courtesy of laura greenwood courtesy of laura greenwood laura greenwood in montpelier vt says she can t afford to start a family because of her student loan debt but after paying for college and grad school greenwood owes 96 000 in student loans and she says that s got her and her partner feeling frozen yeah it s always we re interested in having kids but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans it s just like the final straw she says it makes starting a family feel impossible so if people like greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks it stands to reason that would unleash pent up desires and spending that would be good for the economy a lot more people would have kids or start businesses or buy houses in the short term it would be very positive for the housing market says lawrence yun the national association of realtors chief economist he says his group s surveysshow that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years he s not endorsing any particular plan but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit home sales could be say 300 000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt yun says
