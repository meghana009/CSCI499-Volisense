in july 2024 the world bank and the imf will be 80 years old 80 years of financial neo colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment 80 years is enough the bretton woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological feminist and anti racist bifurcation to mark these 80 years we are republishing a series of articles every wednesday until july looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions if west germany could redeem its debt and rebuild its economy so soon after wwii it was thanks to the political will of its western creditors who had won the second world war i e the united states and their main western allies the united kingdom and france in october 1950 these three countries drafted a project in which the german federal government acknowledged debts incurred before and during the war they added a declaration to the effect that the three countries agree that the plan include appropriate satisfaction of demands towards germany so that its implementation does not jeopardize the financial situation of the german economy through unwanted repercussions nor has an excessive effect on its potential currency reserves the first three countries are convinced that the german federal government shares their view and that the restoration of german solvability includes an adequate solution for the german debt which takes germany s economic problems into account and makes sure that negotiations are fair to all participants the treaty was signed by the federal republic of germany the usa belgium canada ceylan denmark france spain the united kingdom greece ireland liechtenstein luxembourg norway pakistan sweden switzerland the union of south africa and yugoslavia now nazi germany had suspended external debt payments from 1933 and never resumed them which did not prevent it from receiving financial support and doing business with big private companies such as ford who financed the launch of the volkswagen the people s car imagined during the hitler regime general motors who owned the firm opel and general electric an associate of aeg german general electric and ibm accused of having supplied the technology that contributed to persecution suffering and genocide before and during world war ii germany s pre war debt amounted to 22 6 billion marks including interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set its post war debt was estimated at dm 16 2 billion in the agreement signed in london on 27 february 1953 these sums were reduced to dm 7 5 billion and dm 7 billion respectively this amounts to a 62 6 reduction the sums mentioned above do not include debt linked to the policy of aggression and destruction that nazi germany conducted during the second world war nor the reparations that countries who fell victim to this aggression are entitled to those war debts were left aside adding yet another enormous gift to western germany the agreement further set up the possibility to suspend payments and renegotiate conditions in the event that a substantial change limiting the availability of resources should occur allied creditors granted the indebted german authorities and companies major concessions to make sure that the west german economy was effectively doing well and represented a stable key element among nato nato north atlantic treaty organization nato ensures us military protection for the europeans in case of aggression but above all it gives the usa supremacy over the western bloc western european countries agreed to place their armed forces within a defence system under us command and thus recognize the preponderance of the usa nato was founded in 1949 in washington but became less prominent after the end of the cold war in 2002 it had 19 members belgium canada denmark france iceland italy luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal the uk the usa to which were added greece and turkey in 1952 the federal republic of germany in 1955 replaced by unified germany in 1990 spain in 1982 hungary poland and the czech republic in 1999 countries against the eastern bloc allied creditors granted the indebted german authorities and companies major concessions that far exceeded debt relief major german industrial corporations such as aeg siemens ig farben agfa basf bayer and hoechst krupp volkswagen bmw opel mercedes benz and also top finance companies such as deutsche bank commerzbank and the insurance company allianz were protected and reinforced despite the fact that they had played a leading role in supporting the nazi regime and were accomplices in the genocide of the jewish and romani peoples the power of big german capital came out of wwii unscathed thanks to the support of the major western powers as regards the problem of the debt that could have been demanded of germany the allies took the position that the country s economy had to be able to pay everything back while maintaining a high level of growth and improving the living standards of its population for germany to be able to pay back without getting poorer it needed to benefit from debt cancellation on a large scale but that would not be enough as history showed the country needed to regain considerable room for maneuver and autonomy to achieve this creditors accepted first that germany should repay a large part of its debts in its national currency the mark and only marginally in strong currencies such as dollars swiss francs pounds sterling second while in the early 1950s the country still had a negative trade balance trade balance the trade balance of a country is the difference between merchandize sold exports and merchandize bought imports the resulting trade balance either shows a deficit or is in credit importing more than it exported they agreed that germany should reduce importations it could manufacture at home those goods that were formerly imported in allowing germany to replace imports by home manufactured goods creditors agreed to reduce their own exports to this country as it happened for the years 1950 1 41 of german imports came from britain france and the united states if we add the share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of imports coming from other creditor countries that participated in the conference belgium netherlands sweden and switzerland the total amount reached 66 third creditors allowed germany to sells its products abroad and even supported such exports so as to restore a positive trade balance balance end of year statement of a company s assets what the company possesses and liabilities what it owes in other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used and the liabilities about the origins of those funds these elements are all present in the aforementioned agreement the payment capacity of germany s private and public debtors does not signify only the capacity to regularly meet payment deadlines in dm without triggering an inflation inflation the cumulated rise of prices as a whole e g a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items this is the reason why corporate driven policies seek to keep inflation down process but also that the country s economy could cover its debts without upsetting its current balance of payments balance of payments a country s balance of current payments is the result of its commercial transactions i e imported and exported goods and services and its financial exchanges with foreign countries the balance of payments is a measure of the financial position of a country vis à vis the rest of the world a country with a surplus in its current payments is a lending country for the rest of the world on the other hand if a country s balance is in the red that country will have to turn to the international lenders to meet its funding needs to determine germany s payment capacity we have to envisage a number of issues namely 1 germany s future productive capacity with special consideration for the production of export commodities commodities the goods exchanged on the commodities market traditionally raw materials such as metals and fuels and cereals and of import substitution 2 the possibility for germany to sell german goods abroad 3 probable future trade conditions 4 economic and tax measures that might be required to insure a surplus in exports moreover in case of dispute with creditors german courts were declared competent it was said explicitly that in some cases german courts may refuse to enforce a decision of a foreign court or of an arbitral body for instance when the enforcement of the decision would be contrary to public policy agreement on german external debts article 17 4 the debt service depended on how much the german economy could afford to pay another significant aspect was that the debt service debt service the sum of the interests and the amortization of the capital borrowed depended on how much the german economy could afford to pay taking the country s reconstruction and the export revenues into account the debt service export revenue ratio was not to exceed 5 this meant that west germany was not to use more than one twentieth of its export revenues to pay its debt in fact it never used more than 4 2 except once in 1959 in any case since a large portion of the german debts were paid in deutsche marks the german central bank central bank the establishment which in a given state is in charge of issuing bank notes and controlling the volume of currency and credit in france it is the banque de france which assumes this role under the auspices of the european central bank see ecb while in the uk it is the bank of england ecb could issue money or in other words monetize the debt another exceptional measure was that interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation were substantially reduced between 0 and 5 a benefit of huge economic value was granted by western powers to west germany article 5 of the london agreement postpones the payment of war debts and reparations wwi and wwii owed by the federal republic of germany to attacked occupied or annexed countries and to their citizens finally we have to consider the dollar grants the united states made to west germany usd 1 173 7 million as part of the marshall plan marshall plan a programme of economic reconstruction proposed in 1947 by the us state secretary george c marshall with a budget of 12 5 billion dollars more than 80 billion dollars in current terms composed of donations and long term loans the marshall plan enabled 16 countries notably france the uk italy and the scandinavian countries to finance their reconstruction after the second world war from 3 april 1948 to 30 june 1952 i e about usd 12 5 billion at today s value 2019 with at least 200 million added from 1954 to 1961 about usd 2 billion in 2019 mainly via usaid thanks to such exceptional conditions the west german economy was able to recover very fast and eventually absorbed east germany in the early 1990s it is now by far the strongest economy in europe some elements towards a comparison it is enlightening to compare the way post war west germany was treated with the treatment of developing countries although bruised by war germany was economically stronger than most developing countries today yet it received in 1953 what is currently denied to developing countries proportion of export revenues devoted to paying back the debt germany was allowed not to spend more than 5 of its export revenues to pay back its debt in 2017 developing countries had to spend an average of 14 of their export revenues on debt repayment in 2017 developing countries had to spend an average of 14 of their export revenues on debt repayment for countries in latin america and the caribbean this figure reached 23 5 there follow some examples of countries including developing countries and peripheral european economies in 2017 the figure reached 13 for angola 36 for brazil 15 for bosnia 21 for bulgaria 41 6 for colombia 17 for the republic of côte d ivoire 21 for ethiopia 28 for guatemala 34 for indonesia 70 for lebanon 14 for mexico 20 for nicaragua 22 8 for pakistan 21 for peru 22 for rumania and serbia 17 for tunisia and 40 for turkey interest rates on external debt as stipulated in the 1953 agreement about germany s debt the interest rate was between 0 and 5 by contrast the interest rates to be paid by developing countries were much higher a large majority of agreements had rates that could be increased between 1980 and 2000 for the developing countries as a whole the average interest rate oscillated between 4 8 and 9 1 between 5 7 and 11 4 in the case of latin america and the caribbean and as much as 11 9 in the case of brazil between 1980 and 2004 then interest rates dipped to a historic low during the period 2004 2015 however the situation has been worsening since 2016 2017 as the rising interest rate fixed by the fed fed federal reserve officially federal reserve system is the united states central bank created in 1913 by the federal reserve act also called the owen glass act after a series of banking crises particularly the bank panic of 1907 fed decentralized central bank the fed s prime rate went from 0 25 in 2015 to 2 25 in november 2018 and donald trump s generous tax breaks to major united states companies are drawing capital back to the usa at the same time the prices of raw materials are showing a tendency to fall thus reducing the revenues of developing countries that export primary commodities this makes it even more difficult for them to repay their debts as payments are principally made in dollars or other hard currencies in 2018 a new debt crisis hit countries such as argentina venezuela turkey indonesia nigeria and mozambique in 2019 more and more developing countries have to accept interest rates of over 7 up to as much as 10 if they wish to borrow currency in which the external debt had to be paid germany was allowed to use its national currency to repay part of its debt no developing countries can do the same except in exceptional cases for ludicrously small sums all major indebted countries must use strong currencies dollars euros yens swiss francs pounds sterling possibility of revising the agreement in the case of germany the london debt agreement set up the possibility to suspend payments and renegotiate conditions in the event that a substantial change should curtail available resources creditors make sure that loan agreements with developing countries do not include such a possibility worse still if a developing country should run into difficulty creditors are allowed to demand advance payment of sums due in the future policy of import substitution the london debt agreement stipulated that germany could manufacture commodities it used to import by contrast the wb world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries and the major powers prohibit developing countries from manufacturing anything they can import cash grants in strong currencies although it was largely responsible for the second world war germany received significant grants in strong currencies as part of the marshall plan and beyond while the rich countries have promised developing countries assistance and cooperation the latter merely receive a trickle by way of currency grants whereas they collectively pay back some more than usd 500 bn a year they receive less than usd 100 bn undoubtedly the refusal to grant indebted developing countries the same kind of concessions as were made to germany indicates that creditors do not really want these countries to get rid of their debt creditors consider that it is in their better interest to maintain developing countries in a permanent state of indebtedness so as to draw maximum revenues in the form of debt reimbursement but also to enforce policies that serve their interests and to make sure that they remain loyal partners within the international institutions germany 1953 greece 2010 2019 if we attempt a comparison between the way greece is treated today and the way germany was treated after the second world war the differences are obvious and the injustice is flagrant here is a non exhaustive list 1 between 2010 and 2019 debt as a percentage of greek gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another has increased constantly rising from about 110 to 180 2 social and economic conditions associated with interference from the troika troika troika imf european commission and european central bank which together impose austerity measures through the conditions tied to loans to countries in difficulty imf since 2010 in no way support greek economic recovery whereas germany benefited from measures that made a huge contribution to restoring its economy greece s gdp fell by about 30 between 2010 and 2016 as a result of the memoranda that were imposed by comparison west germany s gdp grew exponentially between 1953 and 1960 3 greece must privatize its assets to foreign investors whereas germany was prompted to control key economic sectors along with a fast expanding public sector and large private companies that remained under the strategic control of german capital 4 greece s bilateral debts to countries that participated in the rescue plan imposed by the troika have not been reduced whereas germany s bilateral debts starting with those towards countries that had been attacked invaded or annexed by the third reich were reduced by 60 or more 5 greece must pay in euros while its trade balance with european partners particularly germany and france is negative whereas germany paid most of its debts with the strongly devalued deutsche mark the fact that germany was able to repay a large part of its debt in deutsche marks facilitated the sale of its merchandize abroad to take the example of germany s biggest debts to belgium and france after wwii germany was authorized to repay them in deutsche marks now what else could belgium and france do with those deutsche marks but buy products made in germany which naturally contributed to rebuilding germany s capacity as a great exporter 6 the greek central bank is not allowed to lend money to the greek government while the german central bank the bundesbank did lend to the west german government and printed money though moderately 7 germany was allowed not to use more than 5 of its export revenues to pay its debt while no limit has been set for greece 8 the new securities on greek debt that since 2012 have replaced the previous set of securities owned by the banks are no longer within the jurisdiction of greek courts but of courts in luxembourg and the united kingdom and we know how sympathetic they are to private creditors while the german courts were declared competent 9 in terms in paying external debt german courts could refuse to enforce decisions of foreign courts or arbitration bodies when they were contrary to public security in greece the troika will not allow greek courts to invoke public security to suspend payments now as it would happen both the huge social protests and the rise of neo nazi groups are the direct outcome of measures imposed by the troika and by the country s repayment of debts whatever the outcry in brussels the imf and the financial markets the greek government could legitimately invoke the state of necessity and public security to suspend payment of debts and cancel the antisocial measures imposed by the troika 10 in the case of germany the london agreement provided for suspension of payments while conditions were renegotiated in the eventuality of a substantial change that reduced available resources nothing similar is mentioned in the case of greece 11 the agreement on the german external debt explicitly mentioned that the country could produce goods it formerly imported so as to achieve a trade surplus and support local producers but the philosophy behind the agreements forced upon greece and eu rules prohibit such support whether in farming manufacturing or services since this would contravene fair competition with other eu countries greece s main trading market activities trading buying and selling of financial instruments such as shares futures derivatives options and warrants conducted in the hope of making a short term profit partners we could add that after the second world war germany received substantial grants notably as mentioned above through the marshall plan the lies about aid to greece hans werner sinn one of the most influential economists in germany and an advisor to angela merkel s government did not hesitate to lie in a 2012 interview when he stated that greece has already received 460 billion euros through various mechanisms the aid already given to greece represents the equivalent of 214 of its gdp or nearly ten times more than what germany received under the marshall plan berlin has provided nearly one fourth of the aid given to greece 115 billion euros which represents at least ten marshall plans or two and a half times the london agreement his calculation is entirely wrong greece has received no such financing and what it has received cannot seriously be considered as aid quite the reverse hans werner sinn scandalously equates the germany of the end of nazi instigated world war ii and the greece of the 2000s in addition he fails to mention the sums rightly claimed from germany by greece in reparation for the damages caused by the nazi occupation as well as the loan nazi germany forced greece to give it according to the greek parliamentary committee that explored these issues in 2015 germany s debt to greece came to over 270 billion as we learn on the website a l encontre on the basis of research by karl heinz roth a historian of the pillage of europe when it was occupied by nazi germany germany only paid greece one sixtieth 1 67 of the reparations owed to make up for the massive destruction caused by the occupation from1941 to 1944 see also my interview in the french weekly marianne 1 the so called aid plans serve the interests of private banks not those of the greek people the aid plans that have been set up since 2010 have first of all served the interests of private banks in the richest countries in the eurozone mainly the big german and french banks which had considerably increased their loans to both the private sector and public authorities in greece in the 2000s the loans granted to greece by the troika since 2010 have been used to pay back private western banks and have enabled them to minimize their losses as they withdrew from greece 2 the loans granted to greece are profitable outside greece beyond the greek borders the loans granted to greece under the aegis of the troika are remunerated the different countries participating in these loans are making money when the first loan of 110 billion was agreed christine lagarde who was the french finance minister at the time announced that france was lending to greece at 5 while at the same time borrowing at a much lower rate the situation was so scandalous a high interest rate was also applied to ireland from november 2010 and to portugal from may 2011 that the lending governments and the european commission decided in july 2011 that the rate paid by greece must be reduced in the face of greek government protests and the deep popular discontent expressed by strong social mobilizations in greece the lending countries finally agreed to give the country a discount on the income they received from athens on condition that the difference still be used for debt repayments however it should be noted that revenues were refunded at a trickle and most would never be repaid pascal franchet and anouk renaud of the cadtm calculated the profits france made from the so called bail out of greece they reckoned that greece was defrauded of over 3 billion see sauvetage de la grèce une arnaque à plus de 3 milliards d euros for my part i have denounced the judicially odious profits made by the ecb ecb european central bank the european central bank is a european institution based in frankfurt founded in 1998 to which the countries of the eurozone have transferred their monetary powers its official role is to ensure price stability by combating inflation within that zone its three decision making organs the executive board the governing council and the general council are composed of governors of the central banks of the member states and or recognized specialists according to its statutes it is politically independent but it is directly influenced by the world of finance on the back of the greek people see ecb s odious profits on the backs of the greek people 3 the eurozone crisis reduces the cost of debt for germany and the other strong countries that s not the end of the story the dominant eurozone countries profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders from the miseries of the periphery greece ireland portugal spain and those countries of the former eastern bloc which are now members of the eu the aggravation of the eurozone crisis due to policies applied by its leaders and not to external phenomena results in capital movements from the periphery towards the centre france germany austria belgium finland luxembourg and the netherlands profit from it in the form of a great reduction in the cost of financing their debts on the 1 january 2010 before the greek and eurozone crises the cost to germany of emitting ten year bonds was 3 4 on the 23 may 2012 the cost had fallen to 1 4 a reduction of 60 in the cost of financing according to the french financial daily les échos a rough calculation shows that the savings on this reduced interest rate amount to 63 billion this is to be compared to the loan of 15 billion of the 110 billion promised by the group of creditors that was effectively lent with interest see above by germany to greece between may 2010 and december 2011 in the context of the first troika aid plan we have mentioned the 6 and 10 year rate for german borrowing if we take the two year rate germany issued bonds for this period on the 23 may 2012 at zero interest at the beginning of the year germany borrowed 3 9 billion at negative interest rates the belgian daily le soir noted on 23 may 2012 investors will receive in six months time a slightly reduced repayment on their loan less 0 0112 if there happened to be a grain of truth in the flow of lies concerning greece spain or portugal we should read that greece enables germany and other strong eurozone countries to make considerable savings to the list of advantages reaped by germany and the other strong european union countries should be added the following elements 4 privatization programmes to the advantage of the strong countries private enterprises the austerity policies imposed on greece contain vast programmes of privatization the big groups particularly french and german have been able to take advantage of the give away prices practised on the sale of public property 5 the sacrifices imposed on the workers enable the containment of protest movements in countries of the centre the social defeats inflicted on greek workers and also on irish portuguese and spanish and more put the austrian belgian dutch french german and other workers on the defensive union organizers are dubious about confrontation they wonder how they can argue for pay increases if in a country like greece a eurozone member wages are being reduced by 20 or more among the north european unions notably in finland we note with consternation that some good is seen in the tscg treaty on stability coordination and governance and austerity policies as they are perceived as reinforcing good state budget management an agreement of the type made in london in 1953 can only be reached after a battle in october 2014 i was interviewed by a major greek daily the editors journal www efsyn gr about the 1953 london agreement the journalist asked me the following question alexis tsipras has called for an international conference for the abolition of the debt of the southern european countries that are affected by the crisis similar to what was done for germany in 1953 when 22 countries including greece cancelled a large part of the german debt is this a realistic possibility today this was my reply this is a legitimate demand unlike nazi germany greece has not caused any conflict on european soil the greek people can strongly insist that the greek debt is illegal or illegitimate and should be cancelled just as the german debt was in 1953 however i don t think that syriza and other european political forces can convince the european institutions to get together around a table to do the same as was done for germany in 1953 although this request is legitimate it will not be possible to bring the governments of the main european economies and the eu institutions to the table on this agenda the experience of the last ten years has shown that unilateral sovereign acts can get results the creditors that reclaim the payment of an illegitimate debt and impose violent measures that attack fundamental human rights including economic and social rights must be refused i think that greece has strong arguments for forming a government that would have popular support for working in this direction such a popular leftist government could establish a debt audit committee that would include a large popular democratic participation this audit committee would unilaterally suspend repayments and finally repudiate the part of the debt that it identifies as illegal and or odious as it turned out alexis tsipras chose to implement a different orientation which ended in disaster conclusion let us not delude ourselves the reasons for which the western powers treated west germany as they did after wwii are in no way relevant to the case of greece or other indebted countries in order to maintain their domination of indebted countries or at least the ability to impose policies in line with creditors interests the major powers and the international financial institutions have no intention of cancelling their debts and enabling true economic development the only realistic way of resolving the ongoing tragedy of debt and austerity would be for powerful social mobilization in indebted countries to give their governments the courage to confront their creditors by imposing unilateral debt cancellation carrying out citizens debt audits plays a decisive role in this battle translation by vicki briault manus and christine pagnoulle for the cadtm part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 6 part 7

the economic outlook of post independence zimbabwe resembles a fading cloth with each wash it has lost its lustre and as time goes on it threatens to disintegrate into a rag after inheriting a sound economy albeit one with deep socio economic disparities on gaining independence in 1980 the government of zimbabwe has instituted decades of economic decline and ever widening inequality by prioritising political and economic capital over everything else in the 1980s there was confidence amongst ordinary citizens who generally did not understand the underlying economic structural functionalities but this changed in the 1990s with the introduction of the economic structural adjustment programme esap supported by the world bank which introduced harsh austerity measures and economic liberalisation thereby exposing workers to the harsh realities of neo liberalism the trend worsened as zimbabwe trudged into late 1990s when large scale retrenchments bit workers and destroyed the social fabric of the country the chaotic land redistribution programme which started in 2000 forced zimbabwe s agrarian economy to its knees between 2000 and 2009 we witnessed a slump in agricultural production caused by the flight of experienced farmers and successive droughts this in turn weighed heavily on the manufacturing sector which relies on agricultural produce for raw materials the economy briefly recovered from 2009 to 2014 following the introduction of a multi currency system with the united states dollar as the base currency following the formation of a coalition government after the disputed 2008 election but since 2015 the economy has been in recession all key socio economic indicators have declined with inflation cash liquidity the budget deficit and public debt all taking a turn for the worse persistent shortages of foreign currency have spawned shortages of basic commodities and has driven the cost of everyday goods to record levels the official year on year inflation rose from 2 97 per cent in november 2017 to 3 56 per cent in january 2018 by november 2018 it officially reached an all time high of 31 per cent the highest since inception of the multi currency regime although noted economists have put that figure at a staggering 186 per cent making zimbabwe s rate of inflation second only to venezuela s 1 4 million per cent rising inflation has had a devastating impact on ordinary citizens incomes for those luckily enough to be in work or to have a pension have been massively eroded their predicament is worsened by the fact that most people do not have access to foreign exchange while service providers are demanding payment in hard currency there are also tens of thousands of workers who are victims of wage theft all of this leaves most people unable to pay for their basic needs be it food housing education healthcare or transport as if things couldn t get any worse in january 2019 the government increased the price of fuel by 158 per cent sending the economy into a tailspin that is likely to result in hyperinflation workers called for a stay away and citizens joined in workers face a wall of silence and an iron fist prospects of an economic recovery this year remain remote as the country is unlikely to meet neither its economic growth projections nor its inflation targets current circumstances have forced finance minister mthuli ncube to revise the projected economic growth rate for 2019 from 9 0 per cent to about 3 1 per cent and even this is unlikely to be achieved thanks to ever declining confidence from the international community and the high cost of living unless the government and its social partners namely business and labour quickly and sincerely revive the social contract labour unrest is likely to be a recurring feature of the months ahead faced with an economic implosion and an agitated populace instead of addressing economic fundamentals and engaging in dialogue the government has sought to silence all of its critics for years zimbabweans have been calling for economic stability electoral reforms rule of law institutional reforms and decent jobs but they have met a wall of silence and an iron fist damaging economic measures forced the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu to call for demonstrations in october 2018 which were quashed by the police in january 2019 the zctu called for a stay away and the state responded with brutal force unleashing the military which left about 17 people dead with reports of beatings rape and other atrocities the zctu leadership has been in the firing line with zctu president peter mutasa and me not only facing trial for public order offenses following the october protests but more recently we have been charged with the grave offense of trying to subvert the government if convicted we face 20 years in prison over the past 12 months teachers have also been under fire for going on strike to demand payment in us dollars as the value of all other forms of money bond notes electronic money has plummeted members of the amalgamated rural teachers union of zimbabwe have been hauled before the courts while doctors and nurses have been arbitrarily dismissed for calling for better pay and working conditions the government is trying to intimidate organised labour so that it can pursue its austerity agenda undisturbed as a result the situation for trade unions is more precarious now than it was during the mugabe era the government is unilaterally imposing its decisions on civil service collective bargaining processes trade union leaders are being targeted for arrest and detention the courts appear to be captured and no longer sensitive to labour collective power despite the state s attempts to break it is the only hope left for zimbabwe s workers 11 ways zimbabwe can move forward despite the seemingly hopeless nature of the situation facing labour in zimbabwe there are a number of ways that we can move forward cutting government expenditure the people have lost confidence in the government owing to fiscal indiscipline the reality of government spending stands in stark contrast to its rhetoric senior officials must cut their expenditure and the foreign trips that have consumed millions of the country s scarcely available forex informal sector zimbabwe has the second largest informal economy in the world after bolivia these workers need access to capital and to be supported towards formality rather than criminalised and attacked additionally the government urgently needs to open credit lines for small and medium enterprises to recapitalise the economy end corruption there is hardly a sector in zimbabwe that hasn t been blighted by corruption the guilty need to be held accountable and the business community needs to be assured of the safety of its investments encourage responsible foreign direct investment printing more money will not solve zimbabwe s current economic crisis responsible foreign direct investment is the key to economic growth and the government needs to create a conducive and sustainable environment for such investments policy consistency this remains a major challenge zimbabwe has various excellent blueprints for the positive transformation of the country but these policies are never implemented government ministers must also refrain from issuing conflicting policy statements as this tarnishes zimbabwe s already battered image create decent jobs zimbabwe has an abundance of natural resources from agriculture to minerals and a huge skilled labour force what is now needed is the political will and the right economic policies to create decent work for all drop the dollar although the introduction of the us dollar was necessary after the demonetisation of the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 in the long term zimbabwe needs to reintroduce its own currency rejuvenate production production must be recapitalised starting with the agricultural manufacturing and mining sectors the land reform programme which started in 2000 destroyed an agricultural sector that was once described as the bread basket of africa with regards to manufacturing there are cheap and affordable products that should be produced locally matches candles and mineral water for example but currently they are all being imported meanwhile the mining sector lacks product value addition how can zimbabwe be the second largest platinum producer in the world but the majority of its people live in absolute poverty curb illicit financial flows serious levels of illicit financial flows have been recorded in the mining sector while our unfortunate economic circumstances have led the government to mortgage our mineral wealth to bogus investors hellbent on looting our minerals the government must come up with strict laws to curb these losses zimbabwe s diamonds are said to be worth us 60 billion but who benefits from the proceeds certainly not ordinary zimbabweans instead us 15 billion from the nation s diamond sales are unaccounted for and have likely been siphoned out of the country this needs to stop real reforms the country s image is severely dented owing to its poor human rights record the absence of the rule of law and the recent military clampdown on civilians protesting against widespread hardships zimbabwe s government needs to engage in practical and meaningful reforms on every level despite the crushing national debt no credit lines will be open to zimbabwe until this takes place social dialogue an all stakeholders dialogue platform needs to be put in place urgently the inclusion of opposition parties trade unions religious institutions academia students and other parts of civil society is crucial the command style of governance favoured by the current administration has proved to be incredibly ineffective key government policies are repeatedly announced without effective stakeholder engagement and the result has been resistance respecting the social contract will build the trust transparency and accountability zimbabwe needs to prosper
introduction and summary chinese leaders are ramping up their ambitions for the global order chinese president xi jinping is calling for his nation to lead the reform of the global governance system which is the set of international rules institutions and enforcement mechanisms the global community uses to solve common problems 1 as the largest global economy china has surpassed the united states in purchasing power parity it is natural for china to seek a stronger voice on global governance issues however the problem is that within china president xi is rolling out new systems to strengthen authoritarian control raising concerns that beijing seeks to make the international system more authoritarian as well this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply the united states and other democratic nations need to understand beijing s vision for the global governance system and how that vision differs from the prevailing liberal democratic order which recognizes limits to state authority such as binding international law and unalienable individual rights it is difficult to map china s true intentions based on xi jinping s international speeches which make fuzzy promises that can be spun many different ways such as his frequent claim that china aims to make the global governance system more democratic in order to build a community of shared future for mankind 2 yet when viewed through president xi s domestic messaging and the actions beijing has taken thus far to implement its global agenda a clearer picture emerges the current global governance system is rules based and it privileges liberal democratic values and standards beijing s alternative vision is a system based on authoritarian governance principles in which nations negotiate issues bilaterally instead of following common rules and standards from a liberal democratic perspective if beijing succeeds in bringing about that vision the world will be less free less prosperous and less safe this report aims to provide a deeper and more nuanced perspective on china s real global governance intentions by mapping what president xi and other chinese leaders are saying to their domestic audience and how chinese foreign policy scholars interpret those statements in the chinese political system internal leadership statements are particularly revealing because they convey beijing s intentions to officials throughout the chinese communist party and government hierarchy this report will analyze that internal messaging alongside the empirical pattern of actions beijing has taken thus far in order to assess the risks and opportunities that china s new activism presents for the current liberal order deeper analysis indicates that there is ample reason for concern china s stated goals include watering down liberal democratic principles and either replacing or augmenting them with authoritarian ones at the same time this analysis also reveals that liberal democracies have powerful levers for shaping china s actions in the global governance space using those levers however will require liberal democracies to figure out what they stand for what they want the global order to look like over the coming decades and how to create more space within the international governance system for china and other developing nations without ceding ground on fundamental principles china s reform ambitions may actually provide the impetus democracies have been waiting for to kick start that process putting china s ambitions in context u s retreat provides a strategic opportunity chinese analysts view the global governance system as a direct outcome of the distribution of power among nations according to the chinese view powerful nations design global institutions rules and norms to reflect and further their own national interests since the united states and other western developed nations designed many of today s institutions in an era when china was a much weaker power beijing assumes that the current system benefits western nations at china s expense now that china is becoming a rival power center beijing expects the global governance system to increasingly reflect chinese interests that expectation is a legitimate one but as this report will illustrate some of china s national interests conflict with broader global interests particularly liberal democratic interests chinese observers view the 2008 2009 global financial crisis as the first major shift in global power from the united states to china china s state directed economy weathered that crisis better than market economies in the united states and europe convincing many in beijing that the chinese model is superior to the western one when the dust settled the predominant chinese view was that the united states was declining china was ascendant and the global power balance had just passed a major tipping point in a 2016 article for a leading chinese foreign policy journal affiliated with the ministry of state security cui liru senior adviser to the china institutes for contemporary international relations noted the shift in the international power dynamic he described the post crisis era as a new world order in which the united states was no longer able to easily exercise hegemonic authority like it did in the post cold war era and power was more evenly distributed among nations with different power centers competing and cooperating at different levels according to their own superiority and characteristics 3 at the time chinese leaders were more cautious they still viewed the world as a unipolar one with the united states at its center but they saw it shifting toward a new multipolar configuration at an accelerating rate after the financial crisis chinese leaders began to lean in and play a stronger role on global governance issues particularly transnational issues such as global climate change but they were careful to avoid leaning in too far in beijing s view it was time for china to have a louder voice but that voice should be part of a broader international chorus 4 in 2009 at the 11th ambassadorial conference then president hu jintao and other senior chinese leaders called on the chinese foreign policy establishment to increase the nation s influence on global governance issues but also stated that china should not take the lead 5 president xi jinping followed a similar script after he came to power in 2012 in his november 2014 speech at the central conference on work relating to foreign affairs xi stated that china would work to reform the international system and global governance but carefully avoided calling for china to play a leading role 6 beijing perceived another major power shift in 2016 and 2017 when the united kingdom voted to exit the european union eu and donald trump became the u s president chinese observers viewed both the brexit referendum and the trump administration s isolationist foreign policy as evidence that the world s oldest and most powerful democracies were beginning to stumble creating an opening for china to play a stronger role on global governance issues president trump s first two years in office provided ample evidence to support that conclusion he pulled the united states out of the iran deal the u n human rights council and negotiations for the global compact for safe orderly and regular migration furthermore trump announced his intent to withdraw the united states from the paris climate agreement and the u n educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 7 chinese scholars began to argue that u s withdrawal was creating a shortfall in global governance making it harder to address common challenges and generating rising demand for china to step up and fill the gap chen xiangyang deputy director of the institute of world politics at the china institutes of contemporary international relations described the new dynamic as one in which us selfishness has caused the world to turn to china to play a greater role saying us withdrawal has led to greater confidence in and respect for china s role enabling china to move closer to the center of the world stage through participating in global governance and expanding its clout and voice in the world 8 in june 2018 immediately following trump administration withdrawals from the iran nuclear deal and the u n human rights council president xi delivered a major foreign policy speech in which he stated that china would lead the reform of the global governance system 9 that speech marked beijing s first official deviation from the never claim leadership principle deng xiaoping established in 1989 when laying out the regime s post tiananmen survival strategy 10 the global governance actions china has taken thus far which are outlined in this report largely predate xi s june 2018 speech going forward the international community should expect china s ambitions and activities to increase substantially particularly if the united states continues to disengage from the multilateral arena and provide maximum maneuvering room china s strategic intent discerning beijing s ultimate aim when president xi and other chinese leaders outline their global governance vision for an international audience they do not provide much detail that is partly to avoid triggering international concern and partly because there are divergent views in beijing regarding where the current system benefits china where it disadvantages china and how and where beijing should push for reform although debates continue at the margins three key macro level themes are emerging in china s internal discussions and those themes are increasingly reflected in chinese foreign policy beijing intends to weaken liberal democratic principles and augment or replace them with authoritarian governance principles chinese leaders recognize that in order to continue advancing economically they cannot wall off china s economy or society from the global community however integrating with a global system that values liberal principles over authoritarian ones brings sizable risk because it exposes chinese citizens to a set of ideals standards and benefits their current leaders do not intend to meet or provide to address this risk chinese leaders are seeking to make the international system more like china this is the opposite of what western nations intended when they brought china into that system in the united states and other western nations there is a tendency to avoid framing disputes with china in ideological terms which is generally viewed as veering toward dangerous cold war thinking on the chinese side however chinese leaders frequently claim that their nation is fighting an ideological battle against western values particularly freedom democracy and human rights which from a western perspective are universal values that should apply equally to all citizens as a repressive authoritarian regime beijing does not want chinese citizens to judge their own leaders using those standards where those standards exist in the global governance system beijing views them as a fundamental security threat president xi outlined those fears at the 2013 national propaganda and ideological work conference in beijing when he described western nations as hanging up a sheep s head while selling dog meat 11 by that he was intimating that western nations were engaging in false advertisement making self righteous claims about promoting universal values for the sake of humanity when their real purpose was in his words to fight with us for positions fight over the will of the people fight over the masses and ultimately overthrow the leadership of the communist party of china 12 a few years later at a 2015 work conference at the chinese communist party central party school president xi warned that among nations who fall for the universal values trap some have been tormented beyond recognition some have split up into pieces some have been enveloped in flames of war some are noisy and in disarray all day 13 he pointed to syria libya and iraq as prime examples to avoid that fate president xi has called and continues to call on china to use its own discourse power to push back against universal values in the global governance space 14 still at first glance some of president xi s international statements appear to support liberal values for example in a 2017 speech to the united nations xi claimed that china s aim is to build an open and inclusive world and that beijing believes diversity of human civilizations drives progress of mankind 15 what western observers need to understand however is that when chinese foreign policy experts unpack that statement they view it as a call for political diversity where authoritarian systems and values have global status equal to liberal democratic ones 16 for example writing on internet freedom people s liberation army major general hao yeli writes that the global system should avoid the excessive pursuit of unregulated openness in order not to cross a tipping point beyond which global cultural diversity is subordinated to a single dominant culture 17 similarly han zhen secretary of the beijing foreign studies university chinese communist party committee calls for a global pivot away from western centrism which he defines as a form of cultural absolutism that seeks to hold china and other nations accountable to western liberal democratic standards 18 echoing president xi s call for diversity han writes it is imperative to make more people realize the universal values that have long been lauded by western societies are actually a duplication of western political economic social and cultural models human society should extricate itself from the vicious circle of western centrism and build a system of values that is characterized by mutual learning and mixing between diverse groups 19 xi s oft stated call for a community of common destiny for mankind is part of this effort to give authoritarian principles more sway in the global governance system 20 in a liberal democratic order individuals have inalienable rights that the state cannot take away in china s preferred authoritarian order collective rights and interests so called mankind are more important than individual rights and interests and the state speaks on the collective s behalf to determine its interests beijing is trying to convince the global community that authoritarian systems are better than democracies in this regard zhang weiwei dean of the china institute at fudan university lays out that argument in the chinese communist party political journal qiushi writing the biggest difference between the institutional arrangements of china and western countries is that the former has a political force representing the people s collective interest and the latter do not in the west different political parties represent the interest of different social groups as a result national policies are constantly wavering political parties and interest groups are frequently engaged in bigger conflict with each other and national development easily loses direction in contrast the cpc is a political party dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly and one that has played the role of leader regulator and coordinator throughout china s modernization drive 21 moreover zhang argues that the same dynamic applies at a global level the chinese model can effectively address complex problems that a democratic policymaking process cannot since he views the chinese model as superior zhang calls on china to put forward a series of chinese solutions to difficult issues in global governance 22 when president xi calls for a community of common destiny for mankind he is pushing a new vision for global governance in which the state not the individual is always the ultimate authority beijing aims to reduce u s dominance and give developing nations a stronger voice beijing s primary complaint about the prevailing global governance system is the fact that in its view the system was designed by and for the united states in a 2017 article in the diplomat fu ying china s former vice minister of foreign affairs lays out that perspective stating after emerging victorious at the end of the cold war the united states crowned itself as the world leader and has tried to extend the western order to be the new world order 23 she describes the u s led global order as one in which the united states seeks to transform non western countries to a western political system and set of values with evangelical zeal and is solely focused on pursuing their own interests fu continues saying that when the u s dominated approach was used to address global challenges it sometimes resulted in unilateral military action which led to a succession of blunders leaving ensuing turbulence for the rest of the world to deal with 24 in contrast chinese officials and scholars claim that china will take a more egalitarian and benevolent approach using its rise to bring about a more balanced system in which no single nation s interests predominate beijing describes its approach as u n centric avoiding unilateral action giving all nations a seat at the table regardless of their size and making decisions by consensus 25 in his speech to a chinese communist party convening of political parties in december 2017 president xi promised that china will move the global governance system in a more just and reasonable direction 26 similarly in his report to the 19th party congress he stated that beijing supports the efforts of other developing countries to increase and strengthen their voice 27 he used similar language in his 2017 speech to the united nations stating all countries should jointly shape the future of the world write international rules manage global affairs big countries should treat smaller ones as equals instead of acting as a hegemon imposing their will on others 28 chen xiangyang contrasts china s egalitarian approach with the u s model stating that china will not follow the example of some western powers that have flaunted their wealth but not shown benevolence or generosity 29 similarly fu ying describes beijing s aim as a system that respects the legitimate interests and values of nations regardless of their social systems or their levels of development 30 yet despite these lofty promises in practice as the empirical examples in this report will demonstrate china s behavior often leans more dictatorial than egalitarian reflecting the same hegemonic behavior china s scholars associate with u s leadership beijing wants the global governance system to effectively address global challenges as the largest global economy china is heavily dependent on the global system therefore it is in china s national interest to work collaboratively with other nations to address challenges that threaten global safety and prosperity on issues such as climate change terrorism pandemic disease nuclear proliferation and global financial crises china shares common interests with other nations and that is something western nations should not forget as they assess china s global governance ambitions where there are common interests china s growing capabilities can present more opportunity than risk on global climate change for example china s national development and reform commission describes the nation as a country vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change citing domestic risks including economic security energy security ecological security food security and people s lives and property 31 to be sure when negotiating in multilateral forums chinese diplomats will try to find solutions that are particularly good for china that is to say they will try to make commitments that do not exceed what other nations put forward and will be relatively easy for beijing to meet however beijing understands that no global action would be worse for china than action that requires it to move beyond its comfort zone 32 china s empirical record in the global governance arena china s economic might is its primary lever for global governance reform other nations want access to china s domestic market or outbound investment and beijing can provide or withhold that access to exert leverage over other nations china s development success provides additional political capital leaders in other developing nations particularly those that do not want to pursue liberal reform seek to emulate the china model under xi jinping s leadership china is augmenting those positive drivers with coercive power extending its military and security services overseas to apply targeted pressure against nations or individuals who in beijing s view undermine chinese interests 33 beijing mixes these capabilities economic political and coercive to pursue its national interests in the global governance space those actions cover six key categories 1 shaping multilateral action 2 disrupting international legal regimes 3 shifting international norms 4 co opting international organizations 5 creating new international institutions and 6 building a china centric platform for international cooperation 1 shaping multilateral action on global challenges from a u s perspective china has a mixed record on global challenges on transnational challenges that do not emerge within a single nation china often plays a positive role when the global financial crisis struck in 2008 china worked collaboratively with the united states and other g 20 nations to take coordinated action that prevented global economic collapse from 2014 to 2015 china worked collaboratively with the united states to forge a new global climate agreement for the post 2020 era 34 as ebola outbreaks continue in africa china is sending medical personnel and financial aid to support international response efforts and is helping the region establish a new africa center for disease prevention and control 35 when individual nation states create global challenges china is more likely to play a spoiler role responding to those challenges often requires the multilateral community to impose pressure on the offending nation and beijing fears that if china faces another massive social movement such as the 1989 tiananmen crisis it could once again find itself on the receiving end of multilateral pressure to reduce that risk china leverages its role in multilateral forums such as the u n security council to push a chinese principle of non interference in other nations internal affairs 36 chinese officials and scholars apply this term broadly using it as a rationale to oppose activities ranging from u s military action in iraq and libya to japan hosting a world uyghur congress meeting to british efforts to investigate whether beijing s crackdown on hong kong violated the sino british joint declaration 37 within the united nations china has blocked among other things six u n resolutions on syria s humanitarian crisis and other resolutions on zimbabwean government violence toward its political opposition myanmar military use of force against ethnic minority regions and a peace process for guatemala 38 chinese leaders are willing to take a flexible approach on noninterference when they begin to suspect that by blocking multilateral action china is increasing the risk that other nations will form military coalitions or take unilateral military action to address the crisis in this respect beijing is more flexible on noninterference than on issues relating to universal values during the obama administration china shifted its position on iran s nuclear program eventually supporting strong sanctions designed to bring iran to the negotiation table 39 beijing feared that strong sanctions could destabilize the iranian regime but also had deep economic interests in the region and feared that if iran continued down the nuclear path other nations particularly the united states and israel were likely to react militarily threatening china s economic interests china demonstrated a similar pattern on north korea in 2017 backing stronger multilateral sanctions once it perceived a growing risk that the united states would respond militarily 2 disrupting international legal regimes in the chinese political system there is no authority higher than the chinese communist party the party constitution describes china s legal system as a socialist system of laws with chinese characteristics and calls for the party to fully advance the law based governance of china 40 in practice the party is always above the law and can interpret or ignore laws as it sees fit president xi is currently working to reinforce that dynamic with a new initiative to strengthen chinese communist party leadership over law based governance particularly china s legislative apparatus law enforcement agencies and judicial system 41 this approach clashes with the international legal system when nation states sign treaties and other forms of binding international law they are expected to abide by them even when doing so conflicts with certain national interests the united states and other western nations agree to be bound by international law because doing so enables them to exist within a stable secure and predictable international environment china has demonstrated a concerning pattern whereby it reaps benefits from that environment but flouts laws that go against china s national interests unlike democratic norms china is generally content to leave international legal regimes in place but china sometimes violates those regimes in ways that undermine them from within china s compliance with the world trade organization wto is one prominent example when china signed its wto accession agreement beijing made multiple commitments many of which are still unmet nearly two decades later for example china has refused to file wto required subsidy reports and continues to force foreign firms to hand over core technology as a prerequisite for chinese market entry despite the fact that it is the only wto member with instructions to eliminate and cease enforcement of technology transfer requirements in its accession agreement 42 when foreign firms try to use wto dispute resolution procedures beijing threatens to kick them out of its markets entirely many firms are so fearful of chinese economic retaliation that they never even bring complaints to the wto china also waters down domestic regulations in order to make it harder for foreign firms to use them as evidence of wto illegal action for example after multiple nations complained about forced technology transfer beijing revised those rules to make transfers voluntary but in practice still made transfer a mandatory requirement for market access that pattern of action undermines the entire rules based trading system when other nations confront china beijing either denies violating the rules argues that the rules are unfair or claims that the rules should not apply to china for example in current discussions regarding wto reform beijing is calling for reforms to be jointly formulated by the international community not dictated by a small number of members a clear dig against the current system 43 last fall wang shouwen china s deputy international trade representative spoke at a ministry of commerce press briefing declaring that china is willing to assume its obligations in the wto according to its own level of development and capabilities and does not allow other members to deprive china of the developing member special and differential treatment it ought to enjoy 44 in other words china wants to enjoy the same global market access as everyone else but it does not want to be held accountable to the same rules and standards in the security arena china is deploying a similar strategy to undermine the u n convention on the law of the sea unclos the convention states that when there is a dispute among signatories regarding how the convention should be applied in a specific case either party can bring that dispute to a u n tribunal and the tribunal s ruling will be legally binding in 2013 the philippines used that mechanism to challenge chinese maritime claims in disputed areas of the south china sea 45 china first responded by arguing contrary to conventional international law that the dispute was a bilateral matter and as such the unclos tribunal did not have legal authority to issue a binding ruling china s national cabinet called the philippines use of established legal practice a wanton abuse of the unclos dispute settlement procedures and stated that the philippines was engaging in an invasion and illegal occupation of chinese territory 46 china further claimed that the philippines had concocted a pack of lies to convince an unclos tribunal to hear the case 47 when the tribunal ruled against china beijing stated that china believes the will of sovereign states should not be violated in international dispute settlement and on issues concerning territory and maritime delimitation china does not accept any means of dispute settlement imposed on it 48 in other words the chinese state is not bound by international law and will not respect international rulings that violate its will since the unclos ruling beijing has sought to use its economic military and diplomatic power to shift how the ruling is implemented in the region economically china promised to invest 24 billion in the philippines based on the understanding that in return the philippines would not push to enforce the unclos tribunal ruling 49 militarily china ramped up its presence in the south china sea to deter other nations from pressing their own claims on the diplomatic front chinese scholars called on beijing to use its discourse power to shape the way other nations viewed the ruling and avoid facing similar crises in the future writing in the global times national defense university professor qiao liang claimed that one of the key lessons beijing should draw from the arbitration case is that just as china must increase its military capability it must also increase the construction of discourse capability the previous discourse system is clearly insufficient for protecting china s interests 50 chinese communist party newspaper people s daily featured wuhan university china institute of boundary and ocean studies associate professor huang wei s view on the crisis professor huang stated that instead of viewing the legal ruling as the ultimate conclusion to the conflict which from an international perspective is exactly how china should view it beijing should instead view it as a turning point 51 he argued if china can seize this opportunity to promote relevant country implementation to develop in a direction favorable to china and to unite more countries to support china s practices and attract more countries to adopt similar approaches then there is every reason to believe that when dealing with issues similar to south china sea arbitration in future china will have greater advantages in law or jurisprudence thereby gaining more maneuvering space for diplomatic struggle 52 the common thread throughout both the wto and unclos examples is that china enjoys the benefits of being a part of international legal regimes but when those regimes rule against china or seek to constrain chinese actions beijing does not accept constraints on its own behavior which in turn undermines the entire system 3 shifting international norms international norms pose unique challenges for china particularly those that promote universal values such as freedom human rights and democracy the very existence of those norms is a problem for the chinese communist party because they set governance standards the party does not intend to meet beijing is particularly concerned about norms relating to human rights and internet freedom on both fronts chinese leaders are working to modify those norms by promoting a more authoritarian interpretation that balances individual interests with state interests which in china s case is primarily the desire to maintain single party political control china is convening its own multilateral forums to promote that shift as well as working within existing multilateral institutions in 2017 chinese leaders brought together 50 developing nations to attend china s first south south human rights forum in beijing which articulated a chinese alternative on human rights president xi outlined that alternative in his opening letter to the forum which defined human rights as having both universality and particularity stating that human rights must and can only be promoted in light of specific national conditions 53 foreign minister wang yi echoed this messaging in his address stating that china follows a human rights development path with chinese characteristics that unlike the western version has a more balanced combination of universality and particularity 54 forum participants adopted a beijing declaration which gives states the authority to balance human rights against other needs particularly public order the declaration states that national governments can legitimately violate human rights or as the declaration puts it impose restrictions on the exercise of human rights as long as the measures they take to do so meet the legitimate needs of national security public order public health public safety public morals and the general welfare of the people 55 in other words human rights with chinese characteristics are privileges that a state can provide or deny within the united nations beijing is blocking efforts to criticize its human rights record and is working to water down accountability mechanisms 56 china recently put forward two resolutions at the u n human rights council a june 2017 resolution suggesting that human rights must be balanced with economic development needs and a march 2018 resolution that calls for nations to address human rights problems through mutually beneficial cooperation 57 the march 2018 resolution further states that when assessing a nation s responsibilities in the human rights domain the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind 58 both resolutions passed thus baking chinese style norms which give states leeway to abuse human rights in their pursuit of other interests into the u n system china is pursuing a similar normative shift in the digital space beijing has long suspected that the united states seeks to foster domestic unrest in china via the internet president xi laid out these suspicions in a speech at the 2013 national propaganda and ideological work conference claiming that western anti china forces have been trying to use the internet to pull down china on the battlefield of the internet whether we can stand and stay upright fight and win is directly related to china s ideological security and political security 59 although western observers are generally aware of china s internet firewall many do not realize that beijing also views a free and open global internet as a national security threat a 2015 article in qiushi claimed that western nations use foreign policy such as cyberfreedom to insinuate and attack us for lack of freedom of speech it makes people feel that online freedom is restricted and they want to break through this bondage to get the so called true freedom that they are missing out on under chinese communist party rule 60 china is seeking to devalue those external freedoms by pushing authoritarian principles in global internet governance forums just as china is convening its own human rights forums it is also hosting world internet conferences that bring in representatives from other nations including major u s companies to legitimize chinese norms in his speech to china s second world internet conference in 2015 president xi pushed a set of principles for global internet governance reform that included respect for cyber sovereignty maintenance of peace and security and cultivation of good order 61 president xi stated we should respect the right of individual countries to independently choose their own path of cyber development model of cyber regulation and internet public policies no country should pursue cyber hegemony interfere in other countries internal affairs or engage in connive at or support cyber activities that undermine other countries national security 62 in other words states have the right to control internet activity within their borders and other nations should respect that right china is pushing these concepts in existing international institutions as well for example china participated in all five rounds of a u n group of governmental experts gge process established to study cyberspace the latter rounds of which the u n general assembly directed to determine how international law should apply to nation state behavior in cyberspace 63 in the fourth round china added state sovereignty to the gge list of governance principles a move that effectively blocked the group s ability to establish how international law should apply in the cyber domain 64 the fifth round failed to produce a report reportedly because china along with russia and cuba objected to principles put forward by other nations including the right to respond to internationally wrongful acts 65 after this logjam the process split into two groups one spearheaded by the united states and other democracies that will continue to focus on international law and another organized by authoritarian regimes such as china russia north korea and venezuela that describes itself as an alternative open ended working group acting on a consensus basis 66 china s normative push in the internet domain is a particular concern because it has an infrastructure component beijing is building digital infrastructure in developing nations and providing regulatory training as part of the package china s belt and road initiative includes a digital silk road that brings officials from belt and road nations to china for workshops on information and communication technology ict policy including internet control 67 some of these nations are applying those lessons at home see text box below if china successfully expands the set of countries following its approach to the internet there will be a growing base of support for china s cyber sovereignty principles in global governance forums china s digital package deal digital surveillance and control follows chinese infrastructure projects kenya china s huawei constructed the kenyan government s communication network and installed a video surveillance network that local police use to monitor citizen activity in nairobi 68 chinese digital infrastructure company startimes established a kenyan subsidiary in 2012 and by 2017 accounted for almost half of kenya s pay tv market a position startimes uses to push pro china media content 69 in 2014 huawei signed an mou with kenya s ict authority to bring students to china for ict training in 2017 it signed another mou focused on sharing ict best practices development of ict infrastructure and e government services building ict capacity amongst government and the ecosystem 70 in 2017 huawei donated radio systems to kenyan police bureaus and promised to build a new data exchange platform for the kenyan government 71 in 2018 kenya passed the computer misuse and cybercrimes act which empowers the government to imprison people for publishing false misleading or fictitious data online including information that results in panic chaos or violence or negatively affects the rights or reputations of others 72 the bloggers association of kenya is currently working through the nation s court system to oppose those and other new restrictions on internet freedom 73 tanzania china has supported tanzania s digital infrastructure development since 2009 when its export import bank provided a 70 million loan to finance the nation s fiberoptic network 74 in 2015 tanzania awarded a 182 million contract to huawei the chinese equipment provider to construct landline and mobile networks including 4g lte 75 in 2015 china began providing cyber governance training 76 shortly after tanzania passed a cybercrime bill that forbids misleading deceptive or false internet postings and empowers the government to track down netizens who violate the rules 77 in 2017 tanzania s deputy minister for transport and communications cited china as a model for internet regulation 78 in 2018 tanzania passed legislation requiring bloggers and other website operators to obtain licenses which can be revoked by the government and remove prohibited content when directed to do so 79 bloggers won a temporary injunction against the order 80 vietnam china s zte a telecom equipment provider constructed vietnam s first 3g network 81 and in 2013 chinese private equity firm cdh investments purchased a 20 percent stake in vietnam s largest mobile phone retailer 82 in 2013 vietnam adopted new regulations forcing internet service providers including online social networks and general information websites to host their data on in country servers 83 in may 2018 huawei rolled out indoor 4g communication platforms in vietnam in april 2017 and may 2018 the chinese government hosted vietnamese officials for training that included the methods and experience of the chinese communist party s news public opinion work 84 in june 2018 vietnam enacted a law requiring internet companies to localize vietnamese internet user data and to remove content that includes propaganda against the state of vietnam 85 zimbabwe huawei has been active in zimbabwe since 2010 with more than 300 million in financing support from china s export import bank 86 in 2015 china began bringing students from zimbabwe to beijing for a huawei run program to develop ict talent and enhance knowledge transfers 87 in 2016 then president robert mugabe noted that zimbabwe would look to china as a model for internet supervision and control stating that the chinese have put in place security measures and we will look at these so that we stop these abuses on the internet 88 in 2016 huawei signed a memorandum of understanding mou with the university of zimbabwe to establish an ict training center and a joint degree program 89 in 2018 zimbabwe hired china s cloudwalk technology to implement a mass facial recognition project and sent a group of ruling party leaders to china for a workshop on party government relation 90 according to senior zimbabwean official simon khaya moyo china shared expertise during this workshop on how to ensure that the party exerts itself in terms of its supremacy over government 91 in 2019 zimbabwe passed a new cybercrime and cybersecurity bill that restricts internet freedom including by targeting overseas based zimbabweans who use social media to cause harm back home 92 4 co opting existing international organizations as a member within existing international organizations china generally operates within the rules and therefore can be said to conform to the existing system for example at the international monetary fund imf at the world bank and across multiple u n organizations china uses organizational rules to pursue its objectives just like any other nation as chinese nationals begin to hold key leadership positions however a concerning pattern is emerging the standards of conduct for the international civil service provide common guidelines for individuals who serve as leaders or staff in international institutions those guidelines state that international civil servants such as world health organization who employees must serve their organizations independently and in keeping with their oath of office they should not seek nor should they accept instructions from any government person or entity external to the organization 93 china frequently violates these standards when chinese nationals occupy leadership positions in international organizations beijing leverages those individuals to co opt the institution and push narrow chinese political objectives particularly on the issue of taiwan current and former chinese government officials have used their leadership positions at the international civil aviation organization icao and the who to diplomatically isolate taiwan during fang liu s term as icao secretary general the organization stopped inviting taiwan to attend its assembly icao communications chief anthony philbin reportedly told reuters that icao follows the united nations one china policy 94 after two chinese nationals ren minghui and zhang yang assumed leadership positions at the who the health organization stopped inviting taiwan to the world health assembly where taiwan had previously held observer status 95 according to the chinese ministry of foreign affairs in beijing s view china has sovereign authority over taiwan and can therefore determine when taiwan should be allowed to participate in international organizations the ministry states that beijing will make that determination in the light of the nature and statutes of the international organizations concerned and the specific circumstances 96 the problem is that as the standards of conduct stipulate individual chinese nationals should not leverage civil service leadership positions to implement national policy at a global level this pattern regarding taiwan raises concerns that as more chinese nationals gain leadership positions in the international civil service beijing may leverage those positions to push chinese government priorities on other issues as well 5 creating new international institutions beijing has also led the creation of two new multilateral development banks the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and the new development bank ndb 97 thus far both are largely positive contributions to the global governance arena to be sure there are persistent concerns regarding lending standards for example both the world bank and the organization for economic co operation and development oecd have agreed to limit financing for high emission coal fired power plants whereas the aiib and ndb have not 98 overall however the projects china supports through these two institutions are more transparent and more likely to adhere to high environmental financial and social governance standards than the projects china funds directly through its state run development banks in 2016 china launched the beijing based aiib with the support of 57 member nations the united states initially tried to convince the united kingdom and other major industrial nations to boycott the initiative but that attempt failed 99 aiib membership has since grown to 93 nations the united states and japan are the only major industrial powers that have not joined beijing initially intended to maintain majority control over the bank giving it the ability to unilaterally set the bank s financing agenda but member nations demanded a more equitable arrangement 100 at the official launch china s share was 29 percent it is now 26 5 percent due to the subsequent increase in membership 101 as of january 2019 the bank has approved 34 projects 102 of those at least 60 percent are co financed with other major multilateral development banks such as the world bank 103 european member nations report that the bank s governance structure gives them an invaluable platform to influence china s overseas development agenda and push the aiib to adhere to higher project standards china co founded the ndb in 2015 with brazil russia india and south africa in order to fund development projects in those and other developing nations shares are divided equally among the five member nations just as the aiib is seeking to learn from existing banks the ndb has signed cooperative agreements with the asian development bank and the inter american development bank which suggests that like the aiib the ndb seeks to replicate international processes and standards to some degree 104 overall both banks are largely augmenting existing multilateral development efforts and helping fill critical infrastructure needs which are positive contributions this is largely due to their formal rules based institutional structures which are much more transparent than china s state run banks and provide platforms for the international community to shape the banks lending agendas that is particularly true for the aiib due to its diverse membership and its governance structure which is modeled on the world bank s 105 6 building a china centric platform for international cooperation chinese leaders and scholars describe the belt and road initiative as one of china s key contributions to global governance reform for example in an august 2018 meeting with malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad president xi stated that jointly constructing the belt and road will provide new thinking and new solutions to improve the transformation of the global governance system 106 unlike the aiib and the ndb the belt and road initiative is neither multilateral nor rules based instead it is a set of cross border development partnerships in which china is always the more powerful partner and where there are disputes beijing expects chinese interests to prevail collectively those partnerships create a new international ecosystem with china at the center in his may 2017 speech to the belt and road forum for international cooperation president xi stated that china s goal is to create a big family of harmonious co existence 107 chinese scholars frequently describe the initiative as a new china centric global economic order wang huiyao founder and president of the centre for china and globalization ccg claims that beijing will utilize the initiative to lead the construction of the digital era equivalent of the world trade organisation 108 speaking on china s domestic state run television network renmin university professor wang yiwei described the belt and road initiative as chinese style globalization claiming it will be globalization for ordinary people and will provide feelings of participation benefit and happiness 109 in contrast he described western style globalization as benefiting narrow developing country interests particularly multinational corporate interests yang xilian senior adviser at the china institute of international strategic studies expects the initiative to challenge the western led global governance system predicting the gaming will be inevitable between the emerging economies represented by china and the established economies represented by the 110 from a liberal democratic perspective a new global economic order in which the participants respect china s core interests for the sake of harmonious co existence poses concern president xi has stated that each belt and road nation should respect each other s sovereignty dignity and territorial integrity each other s development paths and social systems and each other s core interests and major concerns 111 in practice beijing has a pattern of leveraging its economic clout to coerce belt and road partners into supporting chinese political and diplomatic interests when nations do not comply beijing accuses them of violating mutual trust and uses china s economic leverage to inflict punishment for example in november 2018 new zealand s government communications security bureau blocked spark a local telecom operator from utilizing huawei equipment in the nation s 5g infrastructure claiming the chinese equipment posed security risks 112 in response beijing called on new zealand to do something conducive for mutual trust and cooperation and took a series of actions undercutting the revenue new zealand receives from chinese tourists 113 another concern is the fact that many belt and road projects are structured and financed in ways that build dependence on china or undermine host nation governance mechanisms the chinese loans often have very high interest rates which can create debt problems in recipient nations for instance pakistan is seeking a bailout package from the imf to cover its escalating debts including its belt and road debts to china 114 from 2007 to 2015 china loaned more than 44 billion to sri lanka to finance a port project via a series of loans with interest rates as high as 6 percent 115 that is extraordinarily expensive debt the world bank generally offers interest rates in the 0 25 to 3 percent range 116 when the project did not generate enough revenue to cover the nation s debt payments beijing forced sri lanka to cede control of the port to a chinese company for 99 years 117 domestically when beijing calls for harmony that is code for uniformity chinese citizens should not voice opinions that conflict with the chinese communist party line beijing appears to interpret belt and road harmony in a similar manner partner nations receive chinese economic benefits and in return they are expected to support chinese political objectives those that do not comply are likely to face economic punishment for nations who are deeply in debt to china that punishment can be catastrophic liberal democracies wield powerful levers to shape china s ambitions but it requires a coordinated effort from a liberal democratic perspective if beijing achieves its systemic level reform objectives the future global governance system will be less free less prosperous and less safe at the same time democratic nations should not seek to eliminate china s voice or contributions in the global governance arena as the largest global economy china has an outsized responsibility and capacity to contribute and it is natural for china to expect a seat at the table the challenge is figuring out how to create space for china in ways that do not undermine the prevailing liberal democratic system doing so will require coordinated action among liberal democracies that share an interest in protecting that system that coordination is not yet happening under president trump s leadership the united states is leaning out at the multilateral level creating a leadership vacuum that china is stepping in to fill the white house s 2017 national security strategy nss states that china and russia want to shape a world antithetical to u s values and interests describing a zero sum battle for influence in which the united states should seek to counter chinese initiatives on every continent 118 for example on infrastructure development the strategy states that china and russia target their investments in the developing world to expand influence and gain competitive advantages against the united states and as such the united states should find ways to pull nations out of china s orbit 119 that framing overlooks the global governance system altogether as well as the fact that the global community needs chinese contributions on global challenges at a time when chinese president xi jinping is engaged in a massive global charm offensive that includes promises to increase china s contributions to the global community and build a more democratic diverse and functional global order the current u s approach is to ignore the global governance system in some areas actively undermine it in others and lecture other nations on their naivete about china to better understand how that messaging is landing with some of america s closest allies the authors of this report traveled to western europe in april 2018 and february 2019 while there they interviewed 30 european experts on china working in national governments european commission agencies and leading foreign policy think tanks to gather their perspectives on current u s and chinese approaches to the global governance system across the board these observers are acutely aware of and focused on china s global actions however unlike the united states they report that european nations take a more nuanced approach working with china as a strategic partner on transnational issues but viewing it as an adversary on others particularly values issues relating to human rights global internet freedom and attempts to prop up syria and other authoritarian regimes 120 unlike the united states european nations are belt and road partner nations and that heavily influences how they view china s broader global governance agenda european experts report that right after the global financial crisis eu nations were desperate for investment and welcomed china s belt and road initiative without reading the fine print by 2018 however they were growing increasingly concerned about the downside risks in particular european counterparts report that china is offending eu states with belt and road memorandums of understanding that require them to endorse a chinese worldview without getting much in return they see normative battles happening at the regional level where china is leveraging investments in cash starved european nations to divide the eu over key issues the experts interviewed cited examples such as greece hungary and croatia s opposition to a strong eu joint statement on the july 2016 unclos south china sea tribunal ruling and greece successfully blocking a joint eu statement on china s human rights abuses at the united nations in 2017 121 european experts also report increasing fatigue due to unkept chinese promises even in eastern europe where poorer nations are more likely to be pro china 122 in april 2018 hungary was the only eu member nation that did not sign a joint letter to beijing sharply criticizing china s belt and road initiative 123 european experts view the letter s broad support even greece and croatia signed despite previously objecting to a sharp unclos statement as evidence that the tide is turning however whereas the united states is currently seeking to counter the belt and road initiative and other chinese initiatives in a zero sum fashion european nations see an opportunity to shape these initiatives in particular they are pushing beijing to make the belt and road initiative more rules based more transparent and more in line with high environmental financial and social governance standards which currently is not happening individual nations are pushing china to improve its approach in different ways for example president emmanuel macron describes the current framework as an unacceptable new hegemony and states that france welcomes the belt and road initiative if it is reciprocal providing market access in china for french companies that is on par with the access china seeks in france 124 european nations are taking lessons from the aiib instead of vetoing the program they are joining it but imposing conditions and seeking to shape its direction across the board the european experts interviewed for this report view the current u s policy as making it harder to marshal an effective democratic response to china s global governance reform push at a multilateral level u s retreat makes it harder to address common global challenges and gives china a new platform for exerting influence for example on climate change and iran multiple experts reported that china is now the primary eu ally not the united states when china is the superpower saving the world in the face of u s induced disorder it has more political capital to push its reform objectives at the system level many of which aim to undermine liberal democratic norms on a normative front as well europeans see the united states as undermining the narrative on why democratic values are important a 2018 25 nation pew research center survey found that the global community had less confidence in u s president trump than in chinese president xi or russian president vladimir putin to do the right thing in global affairs 125 that mistrust and the fact that growing global suspicion toward the united states paints china in a favorable light hinders collective action among liberal democracies one expert who was interviewed for this report stated that president trump makes the western democratic narrative more complex at a time when china is pushing a win win narrative that is crafted to sound like a great deal for the global community another expert stated that particularly on china europeans do not call the united states a like minded partner because the two nations have very different views including on some angles of the china challenge 126 going forward democracies need to find a way to articulate a like minded vision on global governance issues the current empirical pattern suggests that without a common liberal democratic vision china will bring about a major shift in the global governance system the challenge is daunting because it requires democracies to not just defend the status quo but find ways to make the global governance system more representative that is to say more inclusive to developing economies and more response to today s challenges the pattern of chinese actions outlined in this report suggests that democracies do have powerful levers for shaping beijing s actions and here s why global norms are powerful levers beijing would not be obsessed with universal values if the very presence of those norms in the international arena did not constrain its actions and ambitions at home and abroad currently the international community has been indecisive and is allowing china to reshape those norms in ways that legitimize authoritarian governance going forward liberal democracies must figure out what they stand for and when beijing challenges those values mount a collective and strategic response china values international prestige the fact that chinese leaders wrap their global governance initiatives in positive international rhetoric indicates that china values international prestige and is seeking a favorable reception on the global stage that is why president xi uses fuzzy concepts such as common destiny for mankind when speaking to international audiences and reserves his fiery speeches on zero sum ideological battles for internal party and government forums going forward liberal democracies should not continue allowing china to describe its intentions one way internationally and another way domestically the international community should engage china in a deep debate regarding what beijing actually means when it uses concepts such as democratic international relations harmonious family of belt and road nations and common destiny for mankind 127 western observers tend to dismiss such rhetoric as empty chinese propaganda and allow beijing to bake these terms into international governance forums such as the u n human rights council without questioning or challenging them this is a mistake from a chinese perspective these terms define the nation s intentions on global governance reform and forecast the actions china plans to take in future over the past few years china s rising ambitions have produced a pattern of empirical actions that other nations can use to push beijing to explain exactly how chinese actions do or do not support common global objectives such as peace and prosperity other nations can then use china s desire for international prestige to either shape chinese initiatives by holding beijing accountable to its lofty promises or rally the global community to push back against problematic actions the asian infrastructure investment bank provides evidence that china s ambitions can be shaped in positive ways particularly when those ambitions are channeled through formal multilateral institutions that give other nations a strong platform to monitor chinese actions and hold beijing accountable to its promises liberal principles have an edge over authoritarian ones transparency creates a key dividing line between liberal and authoritarian principles in general transparency strengthens actions based on liberal democratic principles and undermines unwinds or blocks those based on authoritarian tenets that gives liberal democracies a powerful tool for shaping chinese global governance initiatives improving transparency for example by giving local citizens and the global community more information about the terms of china s belt and road loans makes it much harder for beijing to sell negative actions as positive ones and extract diplomatic and political concessions in return for this approach to work democracies must be willing to accept similar scrutiny when the authors broached policy ideas regarding cross border infrastructure transparency in western europe some european counterparts pointed out that just like china some eu nations including germany are financing dirty coal plants in the developing world and those states are therefore reluctant to push for tough transparency conversations regarding china s belt and road initiative conclusion in sum china s ambitions toward global governance reform pose both risks and opportunities for the global community on the positive side china has huge incentives to work collaboratively with other nations to solve global challenges as the largest global economy and one heavily dependent on global integration china is deeply affected by problems such as climate change or pandemic disease it has a growing capacity to help address those problems and that is something the united states and other nations should support on the negative side when it come to the global governance system the set of rules norms and multilateral organizations that guide collective global efforts china s reform ambitions are problematic the current global governance system is rules based and it privileges liberal democratic values and standards beijing s alternative vision is a system based on authoritarian governance principles in which nations negotiate issues bilaterally instead of following common rules and standards from a liberal democratic perspective if beijing succeeds in bringing about that vision the world will be less free less prosperous and less safe fortunately democracies still have substantial leverage to shape china s global governance reform agenda utilizing that leverage however will require democracies to clarify exactly what they stand for and how that stance differs from china s authoritarian governance vision just as importantly it will require democracies to work collaboratively to create more global governance space for china and other developing nations in ways that do not undermine key aspects of the current international system about the authors
original post below the fold don t miss update at very end state of the nation one of the finest sources for fresh thinking across america has just published what happens if president trump does not run in 2020 while partisan no one from from the center and left is mentioned almost everything about this is good click above to see the cabinet and policies at this time i continue to strongly support president donald trump for a second term with the hope that he will soon embrace the three ideas in memorandum for the president trump triumph others such as joseph mccormick have tried the transpartisan alliance before and i owe my meeting with cynthia mckinney to joseph but no one has ever brought together unrig election reform as root combined with a balanced budget a coalition cabinet and an open source agency powering evidence based decision making at all levels across all domains along with my new favorites eradicating the zionist parasite from the us economy government society nationalizing the federal reserve eliminating the federal income tax substituting the automated payment transaction tax collected locally restoring state sovereignty getting the federal government out of the nanny business regulations and marijuana hemp particularly closing all military bases overseas reducing the national security state by 70 and more my bottom line is simple the 99 need to take back the power and we need to localize our culture our economy our education our government and all else this includes an end to the federal imperium restoring state sovereignty and an end to the two party tyranny that fronts for the deep state and enables the shadow government i have been working on a new piece for my 35th piece in the trump revolution series amazon banned 34 on

carpenter while there is some dispute as to whether jesus was a carpenter or a stone mason trees were scarce back there the bottom up hands on humble spirit of this photograph is in my view the precise opposite of the hyperbolic gilded trump presidency between them lies the path that i would like to outline for america i must stress that i have done everything possible to help president trump but the gop rino cia and zionist agent jared kushner have blocked me and the president from ministering to our diverse needs my first article in 2015 on how trump can win my spy s christmas message that reince preibus refused to deliver to the president my various memoranda to the president one of them read by four million citizens my trump revolution series and most recently my four page memorandum for the president trump triumph in 90 days with three moves are all a testament to my conviction that completely apart from the president s warts on display by design of the deep state and its two party tyranny servant in congress america the beautiful can and should be restored by our serving president and no other if i run i will create a 501c4 and 527 focus on the military and law enforcement as the backbone of a new patriotic movement committed to community and family values and an end to the mass surveillance nanny state and i will commit myself to empowering the 99 against the 1 unlike all other candidates if president trump fails us and i am forced to run i would be running to empower others not myself i will have four fundamentals and multiple premises for public debate four fundamentals unrig unity for integrity election reform coalition cabinet with cabinet level debates in 2020 balanced budget nationalize federal reserve terminate federal income tax

israel restructuring the executive throw the press out of the white house governors council and reversal of the 17th amendment mayors council deputy vice president for global engagement deputy vice president for the commonwealth deputy vice president for education intelligence research the cabinet here is a starting point for discussing what a serious cabinet looks like read my lips this is a starting point i want the public to nominate others and i want the public to evaluate all possible alternative candidates for each position this is a starting point for a national discussion unlike any prior president i will neither take direction from the deep state nor appoint billionaire buddies i only have two and they prefer to be anonymous each of these names is an opening for all democrats and all republicans to join walkaway and suppport unrig traditional line up more nuanced line up for my candidacy to be viable my preferred option remains for president trump to be the greatest president ever we need unrig unity for integrity election reform act proposed below are two graphics that the honorable dr cynthia mckinney and i have been using to illustrate both the political landscape that disenfranchises 70 of our voters and the twelve core changes that must all be made simultaneously and with no exceptions if we are to assure the integrity of the federal election process in 2020 and going forward it will be up to informed citizens to demand the same level of integrity from their states and localities here is a variation of the above that i have sent to the white houses multiple times it has probably not been delivered to the president this is as good as i get in terms of being loyal to the president my ideas are his to use or lose below has evolved as alert readers have come in with suggestions for example california would lose four seats in the house of representatives if we counted only eligible voters when allocating districts by counting illegal aliens and foreigners including chinese birth citizenship tourists we give california more power in the house than it merits i am also a strong supporter of the first right movement 1 representative per 50 000 overturning citizens united is non negotiable as is the restoration of the right of labor to unionize but not the right of labor unions to demand dues our president does not have a grand strategy for integrating ends ways and means below is my national security grand strategy we need something similar for the commonwealth for assuring prosperity to every one of our citizens while blocking all the illegal alien and birthright tourists from diminishing our land and of course burying the deep state and the shadow government and their zionist blackmailers and bribers forevermore finally no one in the usa does holistic analytics and true cost economics if they did and if that knowledge were shared with the public through an app below illustrated the app and one simple fact sheet for a cotton t shirt we would put monsanto coca cola and nestle and everything owned by the cock brothers out of business overnight here is a holistic matrix for evaluating everything that is going wrong in the usa because of the corruption of our economy government and society now the obvious question since i don t have 6 billion to spend on cheating my way into being elected president is how do i we overcome the financial power of the 1 very simply we combine an absolute non negotiable demand to president donald trump for the passage of unrig in 2019 and we come together as a people to both elect independents and small party representatives to congress such that no one party can hold a majority ever this option keeps president trump in the white house until 2024 below is my 2012 concept for out spending the billionaires and foreign money if unrig is passed then we can create a big bat usa that celebrates the power of everyman and don t give me any of that transgender neutral shit you are either a man or a woman and man is the generic term for both restructuring the executive cleansing the white house the president is surrounded by traitors and what governor chris christie rightly calls riff raff my essay evaluating a number of books about the toxic environment in the white house is free online he is also wasting some of the most precious real estate on the planet on the scum known as the mainstream media msm scum so ably represented by one james acosta the most ignorant and most uncouth journalist i have ever observed there is absolutely no justification for providing these dishonorable creatures incapable of doing investigative journalism and all too eager to censor patriots and truth tellers while promulgating fake news outright lies in service to the deep state with tax payer funded offices in the white house the most precious real estate on the planet enough here is what the president can do with that space to help him be the greatest president ever with this one move described in more detail in my memorandum for the president trump triumph our president will get 100 of the intelligence decision support he needs connect with 100 of the eligible voters and other citizens and readily devise and implement a grand strategy that will address all threats with all policies controlling all costs and taking on all challengers coherently and constantly the national prayer office will help nurture faith and confront evil as a presidential initiative deputy vice president for global engagement dvp ge the usa does not have a single foreign policy it has at least seven in my direct experience the leader of any given country is being told seven different things by seven different factions the time has come for the president to designate a deputy vice president for global engagement who controls the budgets and the senior executive positions of the departments of commerce defense and state and has veto authority subject to presidential over ride over the foreign engagements by other cabinet departments and agencies such as the departments of agriculture energy and transportation separately i have documented a new national security grand strategy that is summarized below below is a notional first conversation between a deputy vice president who is able to whip commerce defense and state into a team one name that comes to mind is newt gingrich another is michael bloomberg the bad news first 1 the defense advanced research projects agency darpa chops immediately to the oversight of the director for national research under the deputy vice president for education intelligence and research dvp eir and simultaneously 50 of its budget and capabilities will immediately begin focusing on how to eradicate the ten high level threats to humanity by waging peace 2 instead of the token 1 cut his predecessor cleverly presented as much greater program 50 will lose 20 a year each year for four years running new initiatives not to exceed 10 each year will be considered those that are whole of government in nature and focused on stabilization reconstruction s r are more likely to receive the approval of the director of the office of management and budget omb who will have a veto authority over all federal programs and proposals subject only to presidential over ride 3 we will immediately begin bringing all our troops home with no less than 25 of all bases and capabilities overseas being eliminated and ideally 100 once we have a long haul air force and a 450 ship navy the national security agency nsa and the national reconnaissance agency nro are going to be cut back to 30 of their present budgets the totality of the cyber war initiative will roll over to be under the oversight of the director of national research with support from the director of the computational mathematics authority now the good news 1 the dvp for global engagement will be the primary us presidential level participant in all presidential level encounters for all practical purposes a few situations not withstanding dvp ge will be the president of the united states of america beyond the water s edge 2 the military will provide the core force for whole of government operations world wide the regional theater commanders will immediately begin the process of becoming whole of government commands with assistant secretaries of state and assistant secretaries of commerce co located with and co equal with the commanding general staffs will become both whole of government and multinational in nature in that capacity broadened by the other capabilities under the direction of the dvp ge it will immediately begin planning programming and budgeting so as to restructure to

strategy center and the office of management and budget omb will assist dvp ge and his cabinet sub committee to address the following guidance from senator sam nunn d ga then chairman of the armed service committee sasc i am constantly being asked for a bottom line defense number i don t know of any logical way to arrive at such a figure without analyzing the threat without determining what changes in our strategy should be made in light of the changes in the threat and then determining what force structure and weapons programs we need to carry out this revised strategy 4 for planning and programming purposes there will be four threat classes each to be addressed by a mix of commercial diplomatic and military means the low tech brute the low tech seer the high tech brute and the high tech seer cincs will be restructured to have one for each while the regional cincs drop down a notch to be super embassies at the regional level 5 for government wide strategic development

convictions have been commuted overseen by disabled veterans every veteran amputee without exception will have a job that challenges them daily now some general guidelines 1 speaking a foreign language at the three level out of five is required for promotion to field grade or senior staff non commissioned grade effective in two years allocate necessary resources and liberal paid leave to make this happen emphasize recruitment of native language speakers who have mastered english as half the solution embrace our legal immigrants 2 we will stop churning people with clearances immediately if you leave government service prior to retirement age or if you leave one contractor position to accept another you lose your clearances the exception will be when the government certifies its active concurrence with the early retirement or inter corporation transfer this will apply especially to special forces and intelligence operations officers 3 i want marijuana legalized immediately and some form of intermediate program for other personal drugs we will begin applying the death sentence to dealers of illegal drugs starting with the bush and clinton crime families 4 over turn the missteps on copyright and patent excessive protection use it or lose it and the original term periods will re apply i particularly want justice to work with the patent office under dvp eir to identify two kinds of patents those that are keeping useful knowledge from the marketplace and those that are being used to blackmail legitimate commercial enterprises as the president has directed we will release into the public domain the 6 000 patents now blocked by secrecy order 5 the computational mathematics authority will get all the resources it needs to completely displace googlegestapo and the elements amazon facebook google meetup twitter and youtube as well lesser others with a new social ecology that cannot be censored or manipulated and conservative as well as progressive voices digitally assassinated 6 begin the process of stopping all foreign military assistance fma i want a weekly report on this i want joe sestak to convert the undersecretary of defense for intelligence bureaucracy into that of an undersecretary of defense for stabilization reconstruction he s losing all the intelligence money so fma dollars are all he will have to work with i want to see a one page draft spending plan seven days from today ambassador mark palmer will be the lead 7 israel i want to meet with you and your cabinet heads and ambassador seigman right away we are going to do a number of things quickly a identify every individual in the us government holding dual us israeli citizenship create a task force to evaluate each one individually beginning with those in policy positions and with clearances we re going to clean house i will not have israeli citizens making us policy or sharing us secrets they can renounce or they can quit and i want blanket counter intelligence on every one that renounces and stays b we are going to have to occupy palestine for fifty years to raise two new generations effective immediately i am stopping all us subsidies of the israeli government the 20 we pay that allows them to commit atrocities against the palestinians that money will now go to palestine however and the arabs will not be happy with my cancelling the fma money but i could care less i am going to demand that they come up with a five year plan for bringing lebanon and palestine back into the modern world we will try a federated two state solution with gaza going back to holding its share of the waterfront from the maps in biblical times i want a regional water authority and i want you to prepare to carpet bomb any new settlements as well as settlements in the occupied territories that are not turned over to the palestinians for immediate resettlement this is going to be thorny a regional and national conference to discuss the whole thing might be worth trying we will do nothing in secret everything will be open transparent and explained i will no longer tolerate israel manipulating the us government or the us public these are early thoughts i rely on you to help me throttle back as needed my eight point peace plan published in russia will be the foundation for a summit led by china russia and the usa with iran and turkey as full honored partners israel saudi arabia and qatar can kiss my ass they will comply or lose everything 8 commerce has just one marching order from me restore the integrity of the national economy i particularly want to dump all federal regulations written by the corporate monsters e g meat packing and get back to buy local across the board take what works in the pacific northwest and new england and spread it out i want an end to absentee land ownership you own it you work it or you lose it we are long overdue for restoring sustainable community in america this will have my strong personal interest true cost economics will be in effect from where i sit the wall street phantom economy has screwed over the main street and small town economies we need to reset the economy although the above makes it sound as if commerce should be under the vice president for the commonwealth that is not my strategic focus we need to create a global economy that gets back to basics including the creation of infinite wealth everywhere else so we no longer have illegal immigration issues here we have to restore our economic integrity in the context of restoring our role in the global economy as a force for creative moral capitalism that also keeps all the illegal immigrates happily at home instead of crashing our borders it s a tough job commerce is going to need everyone s help both tangible and intellectual i picked you for this job for many reasons not least of which i think you are the only person who can pull off a diplomatic military and economic tri fecta deputy vice president for the commonwealth dvp cw here also the president needs one deputy to oversee agriculture and water health interior labor transportation and national design and treasury we particularly need to shift treasury away from conspiring with central banks controlled by the rothschilds and the vatican and other secret societies in the private sector and toward ensuring that we have community banks and currencies and a common gold backed us dollar only one name comes to mind dennis kucinich stewardship of the commonwealth demands that every decision affecting the human natural and intellectual resources of the commonwealth be subject to two kinds of thinking first does this decision conserve the integrity the wholeness or completeness of the commonwealth or does it diminish it second in keeping with the traditions of the native americans whom we genocided how will this decision play out seven generations out in that context exporting jobs and hollowing out our industrial base while playing financial roulette with pension funds and taking chernobyl like risks with industrial catastrophe across america can only be seen as treason plain and simple unfortunately because we have tolerated a corrupt congress for decades a two party tyranny one bird with two wings treason has been legal that ends now dennis kucinich needs no introduction i believe we can trust him to stop all of the forms of fraud and to begin the process of stopping and then reversing the centuries of depredation against america the beautiful and its generations of impoverished blue collar and lower middle class citizens who have been betrayed by a form of capitalism completely lacking in ethics and integrity my general marching orders to the deputy vice president for the commonwealth subject to comments from all of you are these end individual income taxes while implementing the automated payments transaction tax apt tax terminate corporate personality implement national corporate chartering and establish one set of books as the standard for retaining a public charter to do business every american may be a member of a labor union or professional association within four years end citizen unemployment study and define a national population policy within four years the highest priority for what money we can spent will be on providing a full year of employment for every unemployed person contingent on their engaging in a full year of training for jobs we need in the 21st century including manufacturing software hardware and resilience sustainability across all domains including open source farming focus especially on getting the 1 6 million homeless children off the streets healthy and into school implement a domestic policy model that harmonizes spending toward clean water local energy eliminate the tar sands and other such projects that deceive the public by neglecting to mention the three facts that are relevant the true cost of the clean drinkable water needed to flush this crude energy source out of the ground the true cost to america of transporting this externalizing all the costs to the public and the reality that america has all the energy it needs this is a scam intended to provide profits to the energy companies that wish to export refined energy while once again screwing the public legalize drugs empty the prisons employ every released prisoner and lock down the borders illegal immigrants will be deported at the expense of whoever rents to them or gives them work without satisfying the requirement to verify immigration status create a national design of medium size self sufficient cities linked by high speed rail 9 nationalize the federal reserve and do a complete audit of the bank of new york within four years utilizing truth reconciliation methods rather than impeachment and imprisonment methods bring every corrupt congressman and every corrupt banker before the public for a full accounting and a presidential pardon contingent on a full public confession in detail of their misdeeds against the public interest dvp cw will oversee and work with the dvp eir to shut down the department of education while simultaneously creating the 21st century educational system that is free to all for life leverages online learning and challenge examinations where possible integrates apprenticeships in all the trades and professions and generally leaves no citizen behind 25 billion a year shall be redirected from secret intelligence systems of no substantive value toward completely regenerating local to global education we will disconnect local education from local real estate taxes and local elites cheating their own publics more details will be provided as we discuss individual cabinet departments in the context of the ten high level threats to humanity poverty is 1 terrorism barely 9 and the twelve core policies that are now being mis managed from agriculture to water deputy vice president for education intelligence research this is the job i would like to have under president donald trump if he will listen to reason and cleanse himself and our republic of the zionists and sheldon adelson particularly if i were president someone like derek bok or someone derek bok recommends would have my interest and we would fully integrate thousands of anti authoritarian minds now being censored below is my vision graphic a couple of quotes from two of our founding fathers have guided me for decades thomas jefferson a nation s best defense is an educated citizenry james madison knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives the usa in particular but europe as well is coming off a few decades of ethical and intellectual decline philosophy has been displaced by ideology thinking displaced by technology and particularly the technology for war america has become a cheating culture led by a cheater in chief regardless of which of the two party tyranny wings he is closest to and a congress of cheats who abdicate their article 1 responsibilities and betray the republic every single day of their pathetic unethical existence although the vice president for the commonwealth is the principal vice president the secretary general for education intelligence and research is arguably the most important member of the team in terms of the future the key figure in rethinking and reinventing and reinvigorating the american body politic i see each of us serving a four year term as president providing the republic if it desires with sixteen years of stable leadership and a certain consistent focus on nurturing the republic back to health access america is placed under this secretary general s oversight because citizenship education and voting are like the dna spiral of the republic none can exist effectively without the other two faith and culture have been denigrated for too long fundamentalism is blind ignorant and often racist faith is the opposite of fundamentalism it inspires acceptance of the universal golden rule it inspires clarity diversity and integrity america is one nation under god and whether one chooses to believe in the god of collective community on earth or the god of divine providence god is alive and well and america the beautiful cannot do without god and faith and respect for the sacredness of life culture joins with faith as the glue of a civilization and culture the home for conventions proven over time is vital to the transmission of the lessons of civilization that are not taught in classrooms but rather lived in multi generational communities one cannot have a nation without a culture it is culture that embraces diversity assimilates diversity and yet maintains the integrity of the whole we know that our educational system is in the basement it will take a great deal of money to do a complete make over of our national educational system one reason why i am so pleased to place the bloated wasteful and largely ineffective national intelligence community and its budget under the direct influence of secretary general michael bloomberg within intelligence which is about decision support not about secrets we will implement the various initiatives i have defined in my human intelligence trilogy the centerpiece of our national intelligence reform will be the open source agency starting at 125 million a year and growing quickly to 3 billion a year as a sister agency to the broadcasting board of governors bbg but remaining firmly under the budgetary and policy control of the secretary general for education intelligence and research research is largely dead in america the universities have sold out to corporations the patent system is ignorant corrupt or both depending on the domain the web of knowledge is virtually non existent with a plethora of sub disciplines and no integrating umbrella no one is studying true cost of every element of every supply chain and we only have 67 people studying computer code at the offensive and defensive levels of play a third of the secret intelligence budget will be used to revitalize research but in a multidisciplinary firmly ecological and very multinational manner open everything will be our battle cry the secretary general for education intelligence and research will also oversee the office of management and budget omb the new strategy center that david abshire has long championed and tony zinni wrote about in the battle for peace and the new truth reconciliation centre that we invite three prominent internationalists to lead for our common well being all three of these are not now but should be intelligence driven organizations i will of course take a personal interest in all three of these before i die i want to help america achieve a clean sheet rebirth as a world power one that acknowledges the truth of its past sins and reconciles sincerely toward creating a prosperous world at peace information and intelligence not guns and violence are the only means to achieve this goal now here are nine general marching orders voting will become mandatory in stages over four years as part of the electoral reform program education will make voting a much desired and appreciated attribute of engaged citizenship vote or lose basic income education will be year round life long blended with free online learning and call centers practical certificate focused education will follow liberal arts done right critical thinking skills civics ethics everyone including immigrants will come together in national service at 18 and again at 38 the first time for two years enlisted or four years officer the second time for one year enlisted or two years officer to the extent possible all citizens who wish to do so will be encouraged to remain in the reserve inclusive of the national guard and a new homeland service corps the open source agency will empower all eight tribes of intelligence will be firmly rooted in true cost investigations of every product and service and will have as its objective the use of intelligence to eradicate the ten high level threats to humanity by harmonizing spending by all across the twelve core policy domains the open source agency will be the parent but not the controller of the multinational decision support centre and the global network of regional and national intelligence and call centers the strategy center and the multinational decision support centre will be co located with the open source center all research funded by the public will remain in the public domain open spectrum and free open source software communications and computing are a priority with the intent of shifting the entire federal government to open source software and hardware within four years as part of an accelerated moonshot toward creating a smart nation we will move toward open source everything engineering osee as quickly as possible see the graphic below every citizen will have health insurance we will buy all drugs overseas and wholesale for less than 5 of what our previously corrupt congress has mandated the full price without negotiation individuals will be held responsible for a healthy lifestyle organizations for a health environment natural and alternative cures will have pride of place with patient and family centered medical and pharmaceutical remediation as the last course the strategy truth reconciliation centers will have as their objective the creation of a prosperous world at peace within twelve years 75 within eight years 50 within four years using the multinational decision support centre as the whole of government and coalition operations support element i will address long needed specifics about the draconian reforms needed in the secret world in a later posting for now i will simply say that in combination with the above initiatives we can and should be able to reduce funding for secret intelligence sources and methods to 25 billion a year in 2012 dollars applying the savings to education and research i pray that our president hears these pleas for sanity from we the people he should be leading this fight not kow towing to king jared and sheldon aldelson and the other agents of a foreign power that have hijacked the us economy us government and us society these are my thoughts at this time if the president comes around and we see some arrests election reform a few other moves that empower the 99 and disempower the zionists he still has my vote if he fails to pass unrig and he fails to dismiss kushner and bolton from the white house staff then we will have to challenge him we the people will not tolerate the zionist parasite for one more term america first not israel first not qatar or saudi arabia first america first steele sends update 1 trump defense the push back from alert readers is appreciated i have gotten push back from trump loyalists who read too quickly and did not compute all the bold statements were i assert my support for the president and my intent to vote for him and from alert readers who simply cannot embrace the idea of someone like howard dean being included in a unity government i have also gotten very responsible push back on the below graphic that is being retired as much as i hate the zionists i will accept that it is a tad too pushy on the president as a transgender clinton so it is removed as the lead graphic group one the deep state and the democrats plan to do a nixon on our president they are going to keep hounding him and threatening his children as well as jared kushner all of whom are probably gettable on tax evasion and real estate fraud donald trump will resign the presidency in 2019 in exchange for immunity for him and his family former bush adviser says in my view the president s best defense which includes the statute of limitations kicking in on a lot of stuff is to run and win in 2020 there are good prospects for his winning if if if he puts down the ziocons sponsors unrig and creates a truth channel here is an upbeat view on winning big in 2020 zero hedge 2020 a repeat of 1972 trump as nixon group two our president was elected by 27 of the eligible voters he has lost a portion of his base for failing to show public arrests failing to do disclosure on 9 11 which would take down the ziocons and missing other promises he is still out of touch with the 73 that did not vote for him 50 of the eligible voters did not vote at all the democrats and the republicans in name only are planning to steal the 2020 election from our president even if he survives the cohen and mueller and southern district of ny stuff he is still facing a complicated situation in 2020 the single best way to win big legally and to prevent the theft of the election is to do three things unrig unity through integrity election reform act proposed which among other things terminates citizens united and mandates paper ballots counted publicly on site pardon the black panthers and native american leaders still in prison they are political prisoners and make it clear to independents and the small parties that he wants a congress that is one third not democratic or republican he can ride that to a 40 instead of 27 start a rico investigation against googlegestapo and create the open source agency with the trump studio look at what the mexican president is doing with a fireside chat every single morning that has tied the shit media in knots and a two way truth channel that allows him to engage with 180 million eligible voters bill shine and brad parscale simply do not know what they do not know group three you are right i am wrong i do listen the transgender graphic is retired i will not however back down on jared kushner john bolton and eliott abrams being dismissed from us government service they disgrace us all i replaced it with the below for two reasons first because these craven anti constitutionalist and anti american agents of foreign and corporate powers think they can do to trump what they did to nixon and second because there are clear signs that if trump gets his groove back he can do what nixon did and win big o
there has long been a symbiosis between practical central banking and academic research on monetary policy but while this symbiotic relationship continues i believe that large potential gains from trade in ideas between practitioners and academics remain unexploited blinder 1997 when alan blinder s lecture what central bankers could learn from academics and vice versa was published in 1997 he could have not foreseen how strongly the trade in ideas would unfold in the years that followed and especially over the last decade the practitioners in central banks had to often jump ahead of what was enshrined in papers and textbooks and come up with untested approaches such as large scale asset purchases or negative interest rates to tackle unprecedented threats to their monetary policy objectives academic researchers in turn had to catch up by incorporating new tools and channels into their models but also independent of crisis driven necessities the science side of monetary policy kept re thinking refining and expanding models of the economy and the optimal conduct of monetary policy this exchange between academia and central banks is often most fruitful when it happens in person when university researchers central bank staff and policymakers meet in the same place european central bank conference on monetary policy bridging science and practice in october 2018 was such a forum during the two days conference participants would listen to a rich programme of speeches and academic presentations and a policy panel topics included the interaction of monetary policy and financial markets the relevance of banks and credit flows for monetary policy transmission and the current challenges for monetary policy frameworks and strategies nobel laureate chris sims on the centrality of fiscal monetary policy interactions chris sims princeton university highlighted in his address titled current challenges for the science of monetary policy the need for monetary policymakers to be forward looking in their analytical and policy focus rather than concentrating on fighting the last war central banks should additionally focus on monetary and fiscal interactions a key theme in a future that will also require a research agenda around macroeconomic models that jointly capture monetary and fiscal policy this has been attempted in the past but these models should now embody wealth effects on private sector expenditures as this is a key channel for current and expected future fiscal policy impact on inflation suitable measures of fiscal expectations taxes social security medical care would be needed for such models but these type of fiscal expectations appear to be captured less well by survey and market information than inflation expectations the link between monetary policy and financial markets manifold and informative the link between monetary policy and financial markets received a strong focus in particular the role of financial market data for the risk assessment of future growth financial conditions sectoral sources of finance the duration channel of monetary policy and the communication of central banks challenges of capturing central bank communication also arose as a key theme refet gürkaynak bilkent university showed how to decipher financial markets perception of monetary policy communication using a novel data set the euro area monetary policy database comprises intraday information on interest rate swaps sovereign yields and exchange rates this makes possible event studies on euro area monetary policy using the high frequency data in the database the authors identify monetary policy target shocks from financial market responses around the time at which the ecb issues a press release following monetary policy meetings of the governing council from asset price signals during the subsequent press conference the authors identify two types of forward guidance factors shaping the yield curve and a specific qe factor since summer 2014 the role of duration in today s monetary policymaking was another key theme thomas king federal reserve bank of chicago described how the duration channel of quantitative easing policies can be embedded into central bank macro models while numerous empirical studies have acknowledged that qe type policies affect the yield curve beyond a potential policy rate signalling channel several of the standard micro founded models still see a neutrality property of central bank bond purchases for long term risk free rates king s paper derives the conditions and preference structures under which a change in the aggregate level of duration risk and hence qe can affect bond yields a key insight for the specification and modification of dsge models that try to incorporate such non standard policies beyond duration discussions revolved around the comovement of stock prices and bond yields gregory duffee johns hopkins university showed that in the us the correlation between stock returns and changes in nominal bond yields has been largely negative since the 1970s but that this correlation has turned positive on average around 2000 with a similar pattern in other major economies inflation alone does not explain this phenomenon there is a similar time varying comovement between stock returns and changes in short term real rates the change in this comovement turns out to be unrelated to changing relations between the macroeconomy output inflation and asset prices finally the role of exchange rates for monetary policy was examined through the lens of emerging market economies emes hyun song shin bank for international settlements pointed out that the share of dollar denominated credit to firms outside the us has shifted from banks to corporate bond markets both worldwide and especially for emes he also emphasised that the local currency sovereign bond market in emes has matured shin concluded that the increased reliance on local currency bonds has helped insulate monetary policy from global conditions but only imperfectly in a phase of capital inflow emes would be subject to currency appreciation undergo a period of subdued inflation and see strong credit fuelled activity and vice versa in an outflow phase there was a strong focus on the centrality of financial conditions for monetary policy tobias adrian imf presented the empirical finding that financial conditions are a key determinant of the conditional volatility of future real activity he offered a parsimonious enhancement of the standard new keynesian model to take into account financial vulnerability and a financial accelerator channel the model generates skewed distributions of future output with large negative surprises more probable compatible with empirically observed patterns figure 1 according to adrian central banks are advised to account for these endogenous risks when building models to help formulate monetary policy figure 1 distribution of gdp growth over time source reproduced from adrian et al 2018 notes one year ahead predictive distribution of real gdp growth based on quantile regressions with current real gdp growth and nfci as conditioning variables monetary policy credit and banking turning the old into the new another highlight was the interplay between monetary policy and developments in credit aggregates and the banking system from both a microeconomic and a macroeconomic perspective in particular analyses of the bank lending channel of monetary policy with a focus on loans lending rates and funding conditions and the transmission of monetary policy via banks including the interaction with microprudential and macroprudential policies regarding the prominence of interbank markets for monetary policy transmission harald uhlig university of chicago showed that interbank market uncertainty can have negative repercussions on bank lending using novel bank level data he showed that an increase in interbank rate uncertainty raises lending rates on loans to firms with upward pressure peaking at around 100 basis points during the interbank market disruptions of the 2007 2009 global crisis and 2010 2012 european sovereign crisis he complemented the empirical evidence with a dsge model featuring money market frictions for banks given by haircuts on secured loans by government bonds these frictions affect the macroeconomy as banks divert resources into unproductive assets bonds money or de lever and this in turn leads to a decline in lending and output the link between the quality of bank assets and monetary policy was tackled by josé luis peydro pompeu fabra who presented an empirical analysis based on a unique dataset comprising 15 credit registers from both euro area and non euro area countries he found that banks with higher ex ante non performing loans npls supply more credit toward riskier firms with identical effects for banks headquartered in stressed and non stressed countries for banks operating in stressed countries only centralised supervision compresses lending to riskier firms although by a smaller extent for banks with higher npls effects are similar if only banks around the threshold of eligibility for centralised supervision are included and effects are only significant after the centralisation of supervision monetary policy easing increases bank risk taking but in stressed countries this is partly offset by centralised supervision with weaker effects for banks with higher npls overall results show that leveraging on multiple credit registers as done in this paper for the first time is important when analysing heterogeneous effects and for external validity the macroeconomic relevance of home mortgage origination was another key topic egon zakrajsek federal reserve board analysed a comprehensive data set of home mortgage loan originations from hmda matched with bank income and balance sheet statements to study how changes in the supply of mortgage credit influences economic conditions at the us county level the results indicate that during periods of economic expansion changes in the supply of home mortgage credit do not have material impact on county level economic conditions such as house prices employment wages and income on the contrary during downturns a contraction in mortgage driven by supply side conditions has substantial adverse effects on county level economic performance figure 2 decomposition of home mortgage and small business lending source gilchrist et al 2018 notes the red bars in each panel depict the growth of the number of loan originations lending at the extensive margin while the yellow bars depict the growth in the average loan size lending at the intensive margin the solid lines depict the growth of the dollar amount of loan originations the sum extensive and intensive margins atif mian princeton university spoke about the closely related theme of mortgage securitisation he showed that the acceleration of private label mortgage securitisation in us may have contributed to housing market speculation bubbles and eventually mortgage default these conclusions were obtained by exploiting the global increase in shadow banking and private label securitisation as a source of exogenous variation in credit supply at the local us zip code level mian estimated the effect of credit expansion on house prices volume and speculative trading activity by using a data set covering housing transactions information on housing market optimism and the characteristics of individuals obtaining new mortgages monetary policy frameworks and strategies thinking the unconventional the understanding of the role of confidence and expectations in shaping the economic outlook and for designing robust policy responses across different models was a common theme ricardo reis lse highlighted intricacies that can arise if central banks were to use long rates as the main instrument he drew lessons from past episodes of long term interest rate pegging jonathan wright johns hopkins university showed evidence that the responsiveness of long term rates to changes in short term rates has changed since the 1990s with responsiveness having increased at high frequency and declined at low frequency he drew attention to the stronger anchoring of long term inflation expectations and search for yield motives as likely explanations stephanie schmitt grohé columbia university argued that observing a long period of low interest rates and low inflation or deflation creates the possibility that the economy is in liquidity trap driven by sunspots rather than by a sequence of fundamental shocks this confronts policymakers with a challenging identification problem which can be very consequential because policy recommendations are opposite in the two cases faced with a liquidity trap driven by non fundamental shocks the policy advice would be to permanently increase interest rates as a way to bringing the economy out of the trap and lift inflation the neo fisherian effect gauti eggertsson brown university argued the opposite view that the great depression and the great recession were examples of liquidity trap episodes driven by fundamental shocks the policy advice in such circumstances would be to provide monetary policy accommodation which may mean adopting price level targeting announcing a higher inflation target and carrying out qe he concluded that we need to combine the analysis of the long run drivers behind low interest rates such as demographics inequality technology slowdown with short run drivers such as debt deleveraging cycles if we want to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of liquidity traps monetary policy challenges ahead views of central bankers market participants and academics the final policy panel moderated by ecb executive board member peter praet featured catherine mann citi sims reis and lars svensson stockholm school of economics it focused on the policy relevance of neo fisherian channels and on whether non standard measures should become part of a new normal svensson opened the discussion by arguing that the swedish central bank s decision to tighten monetary policy in 2010 highlights the perils coming with premature normalisation of the policy rate and that the swedish experience provides no support for the neo fisherian view participants noted positive effects for the economy from large scale asset purchases helping central bankers reach their objectives but they also disagreed on the transmission of those qe type policies sims emphasised that balance sheet expansions of central banks had been important because some financial market segments had essentially been frozen but that large scale asset purchases may have had a more subdued effect mann acknowledged the effectiveness of large scale asset purchases but argued that transmission channels had not always worked in the ways that had been expected ex ante for instance she stressed that some us households were not able to benefit from lower mortgage rates as the new regulatory environment stopped them getting new loans or were not benefiting from the low rate environment as credit card rates had not decreased much praet emphasised that the ecb s asset purchases together with other non standard policies like negative interest rates stabilised the key risk free curves in the euro area and thus helped in providing accommodative financial conditions addressing the concern that a large balance sheet may expose the ecb to undesirable political pressure he emphasised the need to keep the counterfactual in mind if the ecb had not taken recourse to such bold but controversial instruments it may have failed to deliver on its mandate sims expressed some scepticism on the effectiveness of negative rates as they may act like a tax on banks especially if they are not accompanied by adequately expansionary fiscal policy he also welcomed the existence of a lower bound for interest rates as otherwise referencing to the framework that stephanie schmitt grohé had introduced a negative deflationary spiral could not be excluded svensson explained that swedish banks were able to cope well with negative rates frank smets in the audience argued that ceteris paribus negative interest rates would have an impact on bank profits as lending rates decrease while deposit rates are subject to a lower bound however lower lending rates have a stimulating effect on the economy which in turn benefits bank profitability and so the negative and positive effects on bank profitability would largely cancel out at the same time the balance of such effects would depend on how long a negative rates environment would persist so what are the future tools for central banks participants focused mainly on the size and composition of central bank balance sheets sims asserted that central banks should not maintain large balance sheets for too long inter alia as political economy risks can emerge and central bank independence may be endangered especially in case of large scale valuation losses moreover central banks need to have enough capacity to engage in large scale interventions if another negative shock hit the economy reis favoured a central bank balance sheet composed of short term assets that would be just as sizeable so that monetary policy can guarantee a structural liquidity surplus to control short term interbank market rates finally in response to a question from uhlig reis stressed that several of the insights from the conference presentations and panel discussions would need to be revisited ten years from now if the economy had turned cashless for example the identification monitoring and relevance of loan supply shocks would need to be re thought in such an economy with potentially different and new forms of credit provision and intermediation outlook blinder 1997 testified that central banking in practice is as much art as science recently the art was probably in the decisions of central banks to leave modify or re think existing ideas of best policy responses at the ecb s monetary policy department this conference was valuable as it helped us shape our thinking of how to evaluate past policy actions including new tools and transmission channels and how to systematise our learning so that they can be helpful for policy challenges ahead we plan to repeat this conference in a similar format in the coming years while we may accentuate different themes every year we will stick to providing a forum in which academic research meets the practice of central banking editors note the conference programme with links to several

teleperformance generated strong like for like growth of 9 well above the market average and also achieved an improvement in its ebita margin once again we ve strengthened our position as worldwide leader in outsourced customer experience management thanks to the october 2018 acquisition of india based outsourcing company intelenet which employs 58 000 people and specializes in integrating digital solutions into client processes we have significantly enhanced our services offering particularly in banking hospitality transportation and healthcare today the services offered by teleperformance are classified into three categories core services which cover customer care technical support and customer acquisition digital integrated business services d i b s which cover the end to end outsourcing of client processes high value specialized services which include online interpreting visa application management and services related to debt collection together our enhanced organization and expanded skills base are enabling us to effectively meet our clients needs in terms of their development and digital transformation since end 2012 teleperformance has recorded like for like growth of more than 5 for 27 straight quarters as well as an improvement in ebita margin every year this performance has earned us our status as a growth stock and we fully intend to continue

confirmed our 2022 targets at constant scope of consolidation to revenue of at least 6 billion and ebita before non recurring items of at least 850 million we will also continue to implement our carefully controlled strategy of selective acquisitions while maintaining our commitment to financial discipline the successful implementation of this strategy should enable us to raise these targets at a later date consolidated revenue revenue amounted to 4 441 million in the year ended december 31 2018 representing a year on year increase of 9 0 at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation like for like and of 6 2 as reported the gap between the reported and the like for like figures was attributable to the 203 million negative currency effect stemming from the decline in the us dollar brazilian real and argentine peso against the euro mainly in the first half of the year fourth quarter 2018 revenue stood at 1 295 million an increase of 10 8 on a like for like basis compared with the year earlier period with growth gaining momentum on the previous quarters the reported increase came to 19 4 highlights of the quarter included faster like for like growth in core

the us dollar against the euro the like for like gain was lifted by the sustained solid performance in the ibero latam and continental europe mea cemea regions and by the steady upturn in growth throughout the year in the english world asia pacific ewap region compared with the first three quarters like for like growth accelerated in the final three months to 12 1 year on year english world asia pacific ewap revenue in the ewap region came to 1 586 million for the year up 2 8 compared with 2017 like for like and 1 3 as reported primarily due to the negative currency effect related to the decline in the us dollar against the euro fourth quarter revenue rose by 7 0 like for like versus the prior year period as expected the quickening pace of growth over the year was primarily led by the turnaround in the north american operations in north america teleperformance continued to diversify its client portfolio among the leading client segments in the region the fastest growing are consumer electronics e tailing fast moving consumer goods and transportation services with demand from the entertainment online education and automotive industries continuing to ramp up rapidly as expected the uk outsourced customer experience management market continued to be impacted by the uncertainty caused by brexit after a disappointing year in 2017 growth was robust in asia in 2018 led by successful contract wins in the consumer electronics e tailing and financial services segments development in the region continued to be driven by china and india the most promising markets for outsourced business services in addition the malaysian unit fully benefited from the ramp up of its multilingual facility in penang which provides large accounts in the internet services industry ibero latam business continued to expand at a very healthy pace over the year delivering revenue of 1 149 million for 2018 this represented an increase of 16 0 like for like and of 6 0 as reported primarily due to the decline in the us dollar the brazilian real and the colombian and argentine pesos against the euro in the fourth quarter revenue rose by 15 2 like for like sustaining the very robust momentum built up over the preceding quarters one of the region s primary growth drivers during the year was portugal where the group s business was lifted by the rapid expansion of multilingual hubs serving fast growing multinationals in such industries as e tailing entertainment and fast moving consumer goods in spain business growth was strong in 2018 in a wide variety of segments such as information technologies and consumer goods the group is continuing to leverage the appeal of nearshore pan american solutions in mexico and colombia where it is growing its business in a wide range of industries including healthcare and financial services in mexico and airlines and telecoms in columbia it is also tapping into buoyant domestic markets in both countries business in brazil remained robust in an economic and geopolitical environment that seems to be stabilizing growth was still subdued in 2018 however despite a good performance in the entertainment and consumer goods segments the rapid ramp up of operations in the peruvian market which the group entered in 2017 also contributed to strong business growth in the region to support this growth teleperformance continued to expand its existing locations and open major new facilities especially in colombia mexico and portugal see the 2018 operating highlights below continental europe mea cemea in the cemea region revenue rose by 15 4 like for like to 962 million in 2018 or by 13 0 as reported the sustained growth recorded in the first nine months of the year gained new momentum in the fourth quarter with a 17 9 like for like increase versus the same period last year the factors driving this growth performance remain unchanged led by a very good sales dynamic with multinational clients and fast growing local market leaders in a wide range of industries the fastest growing regional segments are still e tailing leisure and entertainment travel agencies transportation services and fast moving consumer goods the main revenue contributors such as consumer electronics and financial services continued to grow at a satisfactory pace revenue generated by the multilingual hubs in greece and the operations in egypt turkey and eastern europe russia poland and romania rose significantly over the year business growth in france picked up speed throughout the year on the ramp up of contracts signed primarily in energy and utilities financial services transportation services and e tailing regional revenue was also lifted by faster growth in business in sweden and italy specialized services revenue from specialized services totaled 639 million in 2018 a like for like gain of 4 3 compared with 2017 on a reported basis growth was stable for the year the currency effect primarily stemmed from the us dollar s decline against the euro particularly during the first six months and mainly concerned the languageline solutions business in the fourth quarter revenue rose by 3 0 like for like and 5 3 as reported compared with the prior year period languageline solutions online interpreting services and tlscontact s visa application management business enjoyed satisfactory growth throughout the year despite the negative impact of the following non recurring items at languageline solutions i a technical incident in the first quarter that was quickly resolved but which had a negative impact on billed service volumes and ii an unfavorable basis of comparison in the fourth quarter due to the surge in new demand for interpreting services following the hurricanes in the united states in 2017 whose revenue impact was not recorded until the final quarter at tlscontact a change in the third quarter in the method for invoicing the volumes processed on behalf of uk visas and immigration which had a negative impact on revenue growth the method was changed during the renewal in 2018 of the contract first signed in 2013 revenue from arm s debt collection services in north america was stable overall for the year the growth dynamic in the languageline solutions and tlscontact businesses which together account for around 80 of specialized services revenue remains very positive which should feed through to more robust gains in 2019 intelenet intelenet which has been consolidated since october 1 2018 contributed 105 million to fourth quarter revenue see the 2018

improvement in profitability in 2018 was led by the following key factors the higher margin in the core services business primarily reflecting the upturn in profitability in the ewap and cemea regions the sustained high margin on specialized services operations the first time consolidation in fourth quarter 2018 of intelenet whose margin is higher than the group average ebita before non recurring

services reported ebita before non recurring items of 398 million in 2018 up from 365 million in 2017 and representing a margin of 10 8 versus 10 3 the year before the 50 bps improvement was primarily driven by the upturn in margins in the ewap region after two years of erosion and the ongoing margin recovery in the cemea region margins in the ibero latam region remain high despite a slight slippage due to the ramp up of large new facilities english world asia pacific ewap ebita before non recurring items in the ewap region rose to 147 million from 141 million in 2017 while the margin widened to 9 3 from 8 8 the year before as expected margins started to improve in the second half as the adverse impact of certain non recurring factors from 2017 faded during the period and recently signed contracts began to ramp up these developments reflected a return to stronger growth in the group s philippines based offshore operations in a variety of industries including telecommunications online travel agencies and e tailing the profitability of operations in india and china is steadily rising thanks to the upsurge in business at the recently opened facilities the group is committed to continuing to improve its margins in the region in 2019 ibero latam ebita before non recurring items in the ibero latam region rose to 136 million in 2018 from 134 million in 2017 margin remained high at 11 8 albeit lower than the 12 3 reported in 2017 due to the cost of ramping up major new sites notably including the new multilingual capabilities being developed in portugal and the new contact centers opened in colombia and peru the group is committed to maintaining its margins in the region in 2019 continental europe mea cemea in 2018 teleperformance continued to improve the profitability of its cemea operations whose 68 million in ebita before non recurring items represented a margin of 7 1 versus 43 million and 5 0 in 2017 the gain was primarily led by the following factors continued solid profitable growth in business with global and premium clients in a number of countries in southern and eastern europe such as greece with its highly efficient multilingual solutions and russia steadily rising margins in a number of countries including france and the nordics but also germany and italy where the development of nearshore solutions has enhanced the group s local competitiveness

teleperformance generated strong like for like growth of 9 well above the market average and also achieved an improvement in its ebita margin once again we ve strengthened our position as worldwide

consolidation like for like and of 6 2 as reported the gap between the reported and the like for like figures was attributable to the 203 million negative currency effect stemming from the decline in

asia pacific ewap revenue in the ewap region came to 1 586 million for the year up 2 8 compared with 2017 like for like and 1 3 as reported primarily due to the negative currency effect related to the decline in the us dollar against the euro fourth quarter revenue rose by 7 0 like for like versus the prior year period as expected the quickening pace of growth over the year was primarily led by the turnaround in the north american operations in north america teleperformance continued to diversify its client portfolio among the leading client segments in the region the fastest growing are consumer electronics e tailing fast moving consumer goods and transportation services with demand from the entertainment online education and automotive industries continuing to ramp up rapidly as expected the uk outsourced customer experience management market continued to be impacted by the uncertainty caused by brexit after a disappointing year in 2017 growth was robust in asia in 2018 led by successful contract wins in the consumer electronics e tailing and financial services segments development in the region continued to be driven by china and india the most promising markets for outsourced business services in addition the malaysian unit fully benefited from the ramp up of its multilingual facility in penang which provides large accounts in the internet services industry ibero latam business continued to expand at a very healthy pace over the year delivering revenue of 1 149 million for 2018 this represented an increase of 16 0 like for like and of 6 0 as reported primarily due to the decline in the us dollar the brazilian real and the colombian and argentine pesos against the euro in the fourth quarter revenue rose by 15 2 like for like sustaining the very robust momentum built up over the preceding quarters one of the region s primary growth drivers during the year was portugal where the group s business was lifted by the rapid expansion of multilingual hubs serving fast growing multinationals in such industries as e tailing entertainment and fast moving consumer goods in spain business growth was strong in 2018 in a wide variety of segments such as information technologies and consumer goods the group is continuing to leverage the appeal of nearshore pan american solutions in mexico and colombia where it is growing its business in a wide range of industries including healthcare and financial services in mexico and airlines and telecoms in columbia it is also tapping into buoyant domestic markets in both countries business in brazil remained robust in an economic and geopolitical environment that seems to be stabilizing growth was still subdued in 2018 however despite a good performance in the entertainment and consumer goods segments the rapid ramp up of operations in the peruvian market which the group entered in 2017 also contributed to strong business growth in the region to support this growth teleperformance continued to expand its existing locations and open major new facilities especially in colombia mexico and portugal see the 2018 operating highlights below continental europe mea cemea in the cemea region revenue rose by 15 4 like for like to 962 million in 2018 or by 13 0 as reported the sustained growth recorded in the first nine months of the year gained new momentum in the fourth quarter with a 17 9 like for like increase versus the same period last year the factors driving this growth performance remain unchanged led by a very good sales dynamic with multinational clients and fast growing local market leaders in a wide range of industries the fastest growing regional segments are still e tailing leisure and entertainment travel agencies transportation services and fast moving consumer goods the main revenue contributors such as consumer electronics and financial services continued to grow at a satisfactory pace revenue generated by the multilingual hubs in greece and the operations in egypt turkey and eastern europe russia poland and romania rose significantly over the year business growth in france picked up speed throughout the year on the ramp up of contracts signed primarily in energy and utilities financial services transportation services and e tailing regional revenue was also lifted by faster growth in business in sweden and italy specialized services revenue from specialized services totaled 639 million in 2018 a like for like gain of 4 3 compared with 2017 on a reported basis growth was stable for the year the currency effect primarily stemmed from the us dollar s decline against the euro particularly during the first six months and mainly concerned the languageline solutions business in the fourth quarter revenue rose by 3 0 like for like and 5 3 as reported compared with the prior year period languageline solutions online interpreting services and tlscontact s visa application management business enjoyed satisfactory growth throughout the year despite the negative impact of the following non recurring items at languageline solutions i a technical incident in the first quarter that was quickly resolved but which had a negative impact on billed service volumes and ii an unfavorable basis of comparison in the fourth quarter due to the surge in new demand for interpreting services following the hurricanes in the united states in 2017 whose revenue impact was not recorded until the final quarter at tlscontact a change in the third quarter in the method for invoicing the volumes processed on behalf of uk visas and immigration which had a negative impact on revenue growth the method was changed during the renewal in 2018 of the contract first signed in 2013 revenue from arm s debt collection services in north america was stable overall for the year the growth dynamic in the languageline solutions and tlscontact businesses which together account for around 80 of specialized services revenue remains very positive which should feed through to more robust gains in 2019 intelenet intelenet which has been consolidated since october 1 2018 contributed 105 million to fourth quarter revenue see the 2018

services reported ebita before non recurring items of 398 million in 2018 up from 365 million in 2017 and representing a margin of 10 8 versus 10 3 the year before the 50 bps improvement was primarily driven by the upturn in margins in the ewap region after two years of erosion and the ongoing margin recovery in the cemea region margins in the ibero latam region remain high despite a slight slippage due to the ramp up of large new facilities english world asia pacific ewap ebita before non recurring items in the ewap region rose to 147 million from 141 million in 2017 while the margin widened to 9 3 from 8 8 the year before as expected margins started to improve in the second half as the adverse impact of certain non recurring factors from 2017 faded during the period and recently

of its cemea operations whose 68 million in ebita before non recurring items represented a margin of 7 1 versus 43 million and 5 0 in 2017 the gain was primarily led by the following factors continued solid profitable growth in business with global and premium clients in a number of countries in southern and eastern europe such as greece with its highly efficient multilingual solutions and russia

strong like for like growth of 9 well above the market average and also achieved an improvement in its ebita margin once again we ve strengthened our position as worldwide leader in outsourced customer experience management thanks to the october 2018 acquisition of india based outsourcing company intelenet which employs 58 000 people and specializes in integrating digital solutions into

as reported the gap between the reported and the like for like figures was attributable to the 203 million negative currency effect stemming from the decline in the us dollar brazilian real and

asia pacific ewap region compared with the first three quarters like for like growth accelerated in the final three months to 12 1 year on year english world asia pacific ewap revenue in the ewap region came to 1 586 million for the year up 2 8 compared with 2017 like for like and 1 3 as reported primarily due to the negative currency effect related to the decline in the us dollar against the euro fourth quarter revenue rose by 7 0 like for like versus the prior year period as expected the quickening pace of growth over the year was primarily led by the turnaround in the north american operations in north america teleperformance continued to diversify its client portfolio among the leading client segments in the region the fastest growing are consumer electronics e tailing fast moving consumer goods and transportation services with demand from the entertainment online education and automotive industries continuing to ramp up rapidly as expected the uk outsourced customer experience management market continued to be impacted by the uncertainty caused by brexit after a disappointing year in 2017 growth was robust in asia in 2018 led by successful contract wins in the consumer electronics e tailing and financial services segments development in the region continued to be driven by china and india the most promising markets for outsourced business services in addition the malaysian unit fully benefited from the ramp up of its multilingual facility in penang which provides large accounts in the internet services industry ibero latam business continued to expand at a very healthy pace over the year delivering revenue of 1 149 million for 2018 this represented an increase of 16 0 like for like and of 6 0 as reported primarily due to the decline in the us dollar the brazilian real and the colombian and argentine pesos against the euro in the fourth quarter revenue rose by 15 2 like for like sustaining the very robust momentum built up over the preceding quarters one of the region s primary growth drivers during the year was portugal where the group s business was lifted by the rapid expansion of multilingual hubs serving fast growing multinationals in such industries as e tailing entertainment and fast moving consumer goods in spain business growth was strong in 2018 in a wide variety of segments such as information technologies and consumer goods the group is continuing to leverage the appeal of nearshore pan american solutions in mexico and colombia where it is growing its business in a wide range of industries including healthcare and financial services in mexico and airlines and telecoms in columbia it is also tapping into buoyant domestic markets in both countries business in brazil remained robust in an economic and geopolitical environment that seems to be stabilizing growth was still subdued in 2018 however despite a good performance in the entertainment and consumer goods segments the rapid ramp up of operations in the peruvian market which the group entered in 2017 also contributed to strong business growth in the region to support this growth teleperformance continued to expand its existing locations and open major new facilities especially in colombia mexico and portugal see the 2018 operating highlights below continental europe mea cemea in the cemea region revenue rose by 15 4 like for like to 962 million in 2018 or by 13 0 as reported the sustained growth recorded in the first nine months of the year gained new momentum in the fourth quarter with a 17 9 like for like increase versus the same period last year the factors driving this growth performance remain unchanged led by a very good sales dynamic with multinational clients and fast growing local market leaders in a wide range of industries the fastest growing regional segments are still e tailing leisure and entertainment travel agencies transportation services and fast moving consumer goods the main revenue contributors such as consumer electronics and financial services continued to grow at a satisfactory pace revenue generated by the multilingual hubs in greece and the operations in egypt turkey and eastern europe russia poland and romania rose significantly over the year business growth in france picked up speed throughout the year on the ramp up of contracts signed primarily in energy and utilities financial services transportation services and e tailing regional revenue was also lifted by faster growth in business in sweden and italy specialized services revenue from specialized services totaled 639 million in 2018 a like for like gain of 4 3 compared with 2017 on a reported basis growth was stable for the year the currency effect primarily stemmed from the us dollar s decline against the euro particularly during the first six months and mainly concerned the languageline solutions business in the fourth quarter revenue rose by 3 0 like for like and 5 3 as reported compared with the prior year period languageline solutions online interpreting services and tlscontact s visa application management business enjoyed satisfactory growth throughout the year despite the negative impact of the following non recurring items at languageline solutions i a technical incident in the first quarter that was quickly resolved but which had a negative impact on billed service volumes and ii an unfavorable basis of comparison in the fourth quarter due to the surge in new demand for interpreting services following the hurricanes in the united states in 2017 whose revenue impact was not recorded until the final quarter at tlscontact a change in the third quarter in the method for invoicing the volumes processed on behalf of uk visas and immigration which had a negative impact on revenue growth the method was changed during the renewal in 2018 of the contract first signed in 2013 revenue from arm s debt collection services in north america was stable overall for the year the growth dynamic in the languageline solutions and tlscontact businesses which together account for around 80 of specialized services revenue remains very positive which should feed through to more robust gains in 2019 intelenet intelenet which has been consolidated since october 1 2018 contributed 105 million to fourth quarter revenue see the 2018 operating highlights below

before non recurring items of 398 million in 2018 up from 365 million in 2017 and representing a margin of 10 8 versus 10 3 the year before the 50 bps improvement was primarily driven by the upturn in margins in the ewap region after two years of erosion and the ongoing margin recovery in the cemea region margins in the ibero latam region remain high despite a slight slippage due to the ramp up of large new facilities english world asia pacific ewap ebita before non recurring items in the ewap region rose to 147 million from 141 million in 2017 while the margin widened to 9 3 from 8 8 the year before as expected margins started to improve in the second half as the adverse impact of certain non recurring factors from 2017 faded during the period and recently signed contracts began to ramp up

whose 68 million in ebita before non recurring items represented a margin of 7 1 versus 43 million and 5 0 in 2017 the gain was primarily led by the following factors continued solid profitable growth in business with global and premium clients in a number of countries in southern and eastern europe such as greece with its highly efficient multilingual solutions and russia steadily rising margins

expansion and cross border operations especially into colombia risk destabilising the entire region at a time of extreme uncertainty in venezuela what should be done providing humanitarian care for affected populations preserving communications between neighbouring armed forces and restarting peace talks with rebels in colombia are essential next steps sanctions targeting gold exports are counterproductive and should be abandoned in favour of stronger due diligence on mineral trading executive summary far from venezuela s centres of power where the fight to decide the country s political future is being waged the vast tropical regions to the south are exposed to acute risks of intensifying conflict rich in gold and rare metals bolívar and amazonas states have caught the eye of officials pressed to compensate for declining oil revenues and general economic collapse at the same time violent criminal groups have asserted control over mining communities often in league with authorities more recently colombian guerrillas and former rebels have crossed the orinoco river to seize their share of the largely illegal mining industry the riches and rebel proliferation in the south complicate prospects for a peaceful transition in caracas by reinforcing military resistance to political change and stoking risks of cross border violence and low intensity warfare humanitarian attention for populations in the south regular communication between neighbouring armed forces renewed efforts to make peace with the guerrillas and cleaning up the gold trade will prove vital to easing tensions and protecting vulnerable venezuelans local largely indigenous communities at the frontline of the spread of illegal mining and expansion of criminal or rebel groups now face the greatest hardships exposed to terror meted out by armed outfits seeking to enforce obedience with homicide rates in some mining towns reaching extraordinary highs these residents also face the effects on their health and environment from mercury spill offs and a malaria epidemic extreme isolation and an oppressive state and security force presence silence many of these communities these tensions surfaced on 23 february when venezuelan security forces killed at least three protesters and forced an indigenous mayor into exile during an attempt to bring humanitarian aid from brazil venezuela as a whole plunged into a deeper crisis on 23 january when in the wake of presidential elections widely deemed unfair national assembly chairman juan guaidó laid claim to the post of interim president the u s canada and several latin american and european states endorsed the move but incumbent nicolás maduro is unlikely to relinquish power easily in this already tense climate entrenched financial interests and instability in the south could undermine the prospects of a peaceful change of leadership illegal mining profits are one of the armed forces most coveted revenue streams their desire to protect that income reinforces their loyalty to maduro and gives the government an economic lifeline armed groups exploiting the isolated terrain and limited government presence in the southern regions present other risks of violence cross border movements of the colombian guerrilla national liberation army eln or dissident factions of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc operating in the mining regions could provoke a flare up between colombian and venezuelan armed forces given the animosity between the two states and venezuelan support for the eln bogotá may well perceive future eln attacks on colombian soil as a strike ordered by caracas awareness of the potential for worsening violent unrest in bolívar and amazonas should inform regional and international policy toward venezuela should foreign forces intervene in venezuela to depose maduro at guaidó s request these rebel groups could be drawn to supporting the cause of the incumbent government and in the very worst case perpetuate a low intensity conflict at the same time loyalties on the ground in southern venezuela are volatile and unpredictable eyewitness testimonies point to regular collusion between non state armed groups operating protection rackets in and around mines and officers from venezuela s national guard and regional military command former military and intelligence officers allege that complicity with these operations reaches the top ranks of the government and armed forces where international gold sales from the mining arc are coordinated but factional rivalries plague all of these illicit relations last november the eln and national guard engaged in a skirmish that killed four guardsmen fighting between the eln and venezuelan criminal groups known as sindicatos is also common and has driven both groups closer to mining areas on the guyanese border awareness of the potential for worsening violent unrest in bolívar and amazonas should inform regional and international policy toward venezuela especially in the event of a change in leadership colombian and venezuelan armed forces stationed on the frontier should acknowledge the grave risks that cross border rebel movements pose to regional peace and preserve channels of communications to clarify suspect incidents and prevent skirmishes involving non state armed groups from escalating although peace talks between the colombian government and the eln fell apart following the bombing of a police academy in bogotá in january that killed 22 people colombia should be ready to renew negotiations if signs emerge that the guerrillas are willing to embark on serious talks outside powers and the venezuelan opposition should also curb calls for a foreign military intervention in venezuela which only serve to galvanise these groups to fight foreign armies and protect their patrons within the maduro government colombian authorities should entirely discount the possibility of a military incursion into venezuela to strike the eln given that it would expose civilians to even greater levels of violence meanwhile the south is in urgent need of humanitarian aid as well as a major health assistance program aimed at containing its malaria epidemic the gold mining industry which sits at the heart of the region s health and environmental risks as well as its profusion of armed groups also merits a concerted international response sanctions on gold exports as proposed last year by the u s would in all likelihood increase traffickers control over the trade weaning gold away from the circuits of criminals and corrupt officials will instead require a gradual transformation of southern venezuela s mining enclaves based on the enforcement by oecd member states of international due diligence guidelines on gold and coltan trading the contest for the presidency in venezuela has raised fears that the country could succumb to chaotic and violent disintegration with no place more vulnerable to this fate than the southern regions what happens in bolívar and amazonas constitutes an acid test of whether this deeply polarised country can exit its crisis in peace bogotá caracas brussels 28 february 2019 loading video crisis group s latin america program director ivan briscoe and andes region expert bram ebus discuss the potential threats of illegal gold mining in southern venezuela crisisgroup i introduction an ongoing fight for the presidency appalling economic hardship and the flight of millions of migrants and refugees command most international attention to venezuela by contrast developments in the country s remote and sparsely populated southern regions bounded by the orinoco river the brazilian savannah and the jungle border with guyana tend to go unnoticed but criminal violence state repression extreme scarcity and contraband smuggling in the southern mining regions pose acute security challenges and a serious threat to regional stability at the root of the south s predicament is a national economic meltdown venezuela s oil production has halved since 2014 driving the state to exploit other sources of revenue on 26 february 2016 president nicolás maduro created a new legal framework for mining including the creation of the orinoco mining arc described as a complex and ambitious strategic plan to attract investments he announced 5 5 billion in mining deals in 2016 two years later in an address to the un general assembly maduro claimed that venezuela has potentially the world s largest gold reserves the country also has plentiful deposits of the valuable metal coltan diamonds and even uranium but the venezuelan state and foreign investors are not the only parties fuelling the mining rush organised criminal networks and illegal armed groups have staked control over different parts of the region where they command obedience in most of the mining towns and over an estimated 300 000 miners importantly not all of these groups are venezuelan but increasingly feature colombian guerrillas and dissident rebels who are expanding their presence along a largely unmonitored border in the wake of their faltering peace processes their activities will have a significant impact on regional peace and security one of these guerrilla groups the national liberation army eln detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of a police academy in bogotá on 17 january 2019 killing 22 and wounding dozens more in response colombian president iván duque terminated already suspended peace talks with the eln clearing the way for a renewed counterinsurgent offensive against a group that straddles the border with venezuela and enjoys support and protection from parts of the venezuelan government as the illegal mining bonanza expands the border regions are becoming more exposed to violence and unrest from southern venezuela meanwhile the massacre in october 2018 of sixteen miners near the town of tumeremo in the southern venezuelan state of bolívar crudely illustrated the intensity of violence involving armed groups around mining areas but this was not the only mass killing in the region media reports indicate that twelve massacres have occurred in bolívar state since 2016 with 107 killed the true figure is sure to be much higher many murders go unreported because they take place in remote places often inhabited by indigenous people with limited transport or communication infrastructure victimised communities fear speaking to outsiders even when relatives go missing more than two years after maduro s mining arc decree the promised big investors and mining firms have so far stayed away the spread of violent actors in the region and the ravages of wildcat mining operations are harming indigenous territories and their fragile ecosystems indigenous groups sometimes armed have fought back against the incursions of mining operations non state groups and state forces are clashing more frequently and as the illegal mining bonanza expands the border regions of guyana brazil and especially colombia are becoming more exposed to violence and unrest from southern venezuela against a backdrop of heightened tensions and withering diplomatic relations between venezuela and its neighbours the turmoil in these border areas have now become a potential flashpoint for future conflict field research for this report included over 100 interviews with experts community leaders military officers and former and current miners and mineral traders along the venezuela colombia border a two day workshop with 15 indigenous representatives from venezuela in late 2018 helped pinpoint the main risks of conflict and instability in the country s mining regions ii illegal armed groups in southern venezuela local criminal groups colombian guerrilla and dissident insurgent factions and corrupt elements of the security forces control vast areas south of the orinoco river due to venezuela s fast shifting politics and the economic attractions of mining the landscape of armed actors has transformed in recent years collaboration between armed state and non state actors is sometimes overt but usually hard to detect a criminal groups and colombian guerrillas the main criminal organisations in bolívar state are either sindicatos literally unions or gangs run by so called pranes a pran is the boss of a criminal group normally dedicated to drug trafficking and extortion who often runs his operations from prison the sindicatos meanwhile emerged from the construction workers unions in bolívar s two main cities puerto ordaz and ciudad bolívar according to workers construction unions regularly obtained labour contracts in the building industry through intimidation and extortion and were already operating as organised crime outfits before the economic crisis caused the industry to contract the pranes and sindicatos have in effect merged into one single criminal phenomenon although violent clashes between competing groups still flare up venezuela s economic woes have forced them to diversify their portfolio of illicit activities in turn prompting their expansion and aggravating disputes over territorial control right now the pranes don t need to get their weapons from the government because they have enough gold to buy their own weaponry says a ngo representative the military has allegedly sometimes armed the sindicatos who operate in alliance with state security forces that in return receive payments in gold but at the same time these criminal gangs have become more independent and harder to control as they gain ground and expand their political and economic influence to the west of bolívar bordering colombia and brazil is the state of amazonas which historically has provided a point of entry into venezuela for colombian leftist guerrilla groups namely the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc and the national liberation army eln these groups operated in the country before the late president hugo chávez came to power in 1999 but have gained a much firmer foothold over the past two decades as a result of their ideological affinities with the governments of chávez and maduro and evermore overlapping economic interests official venezuelan tolerance of colombian guerrilla groups however predates the mining boom in the south of the country an early indication of the state s leniency came in 2005 when national guard lt colonel josé humberto quintero was jailed for capturing farc leader ricardo gonzález the group s so called foreign minister in doing so the venezuelan government signalled that the guerrillas could operate with impunity the farc once colombia s biggest insurgency until it laid down its arms in 2017 found in venezuela both a safe haven for evading colombia s armed forces and a new territory to expand lucrative drug trafficking and illegal mining activities on taking office and especially after regaining power after a failed coup attempt in 2002 president chávez allowed colombian guerrillas to cross into venezuela more easily in a 2008 address to parliament carried live on television chávez insisted that neither the farc nor the eln was a terrorist group but genuine armies and insurgent forces with a political goal despite chávez s call later that year for the guerrillas to demobilise the farc continued to make use of venezuela as a strategic rear guard moving fighters weapons and kidnapping victims across the border the eln in particular has increased its footprint across venezuela s mining areas the eln colombia s second largest guerrilla group with an estimated 2 000 fighters inside that country has been crossing regularly into venezuela for decades the eln operates in at least thirteen out of venezuela s 24 states while several of its leaders live in venezuela according to fundaredes a venezuela based ngo the eln controls radio stations influences school curriculums and is closely connected to local politicians despite taking part in peace talks from 2017 to january 2019 it has also reinvented itself in venezuela absorbing new recruits and shifting from a guerrilla force that embraced armed resistance against colombia s ruling elites to one with many core operations in venezuela the colombian guerrillas are not border guerrillas said a local ngo director though they have camps throughout the border region their activity in venezuela is nationwide an eln camp even reportedly exists in the sierra de san luis located between lara and falcón states within 30 kilometres of the caribbean coast this foothold could grant them control over trafficking routes toward the dutch caribbean b expansion along the resource rich frontier venezuelan crime syndicates control large swathes of resource rich territory in bolívar state and run illegal mining operations up to the border with guyana where sindicatos recently murdered guyanese miners intimidation and extreme violence have become the preferred means for ensuring local communities obey the gangs sindicatos have also operated along the brazilian border where they have clashed with indigenous self defence groups trying to protect their lands yet in spite of their rapid expansion the sindicatos are under threat from competitors coming from colombia according to a senior former commander the eln now earns about 60 per cent of its income from mining and mining related activities in colombia and venezuela while a dissident farc front known as acacio medina derives more than half its revenues from mining operations inside venezuela the eln in particular has increased its footprint across venezuela s mining areas local miners report that it taxes illegal mining operations and related activities such as the transport of supplies to the mines the eln also subcontracts other armed actors for its operations making it difficult to know exactly how extensive the guerrillas activities are but numerous witnesses to the mining business testify that the eln now controls an east west corridor across the main mineral regions of southern venezuela consolidating its authority in some mining areas as it seeks to spread to others sindicatos still run most of the mines in bolívar state but have recently lost ground to the eln in the municipalities of cedeño sifontes piar sucre angostura and roscio on the day of the presidential election in venezuela on 20 may 2018 the guerrillas reportedly seized a large number of mines in a central region of bolívar state from the sindicatos who had left them almost deserted while they mobilised voters for maduro armed guards left behind were killed in the takeover the group also operates along the border with guyana where it has reportedly established corridors for financial and logistical support over the past decade and has sought contact with communities in the gran sabana municipality close to brazil in amazonas state indigenous community leaders report the presence of farc dissidents and eln guerrillas in all seven state municipalities two of which border brazil and five colombia where they are deeply involved in mining activities mining in amazonas state has been illegal since the 1989 decree 269 covering the alto orinoco casiquiare biosphere reserve and other national parks but it still dominates the region s economy the three main venezuelan towns bordering colombia along the orinoco river puerto páez apure state puerto ayacucho and san fernando de atabapo both amazonas state are all reported to feature a strong eln presence a number of sources identify a combatant called alex bonito as the guerrillas local leader farc dissidents of the acacio medina front meanwhile control the area of puerto colombia san felipe on the colombian side of the rio negro and operate in the rio negro municipality on the venezuelan side of the river farc dissidents also reportedly run the mines of yapacana in amazonas according to a former combatant from the farc s 16th front which used to operate mainly in the vichada guainía and vaupés departments the group became familiar with the yapacana mines while they were taxing illegal coltan and gold mining operations in the guainía region of colombia in 2007 colombian intelligence sources maintain that the 16th front did not demobilise in 2017 after the peace agreement because the illegal mining business had become so lucrative several colombian and venezuelan miners who travel from the mines to sell their gold in puerto inírida in the colombian state of guainía say the eln is also present in and around the yapacana mines the two armed groups seem to operate through a loose alliance along with members of the national guard based in the area for farc dissidents and eln members sceptical of peace with the colombian government venezuela will likely remain a safe haven as long as the government in caracas does not change the activities of dissident group acacio medina comprised of former members from nine farc fronts and reportedly led by géner garcía molina alias jhon 40 sheds light on how these groups operate in addition to mines acacio medina controls 30 40 gold dredging boats on the río negro in south eastern guainía for each boat the dissidents receive an estimated ten grams of gold a month in taxes the market value of which is roughly 400 a criminal network involving acacio medina allegedly operating alongside military officers and a prison guard flies out 15 20kg of gold to colombia a week according to intelligence sources using the rivers guaviare guainía and inírida that cross the border between venezuela and colombia acacio medina also allegedly moves weapons cocaine and money in coordination with dissident fronts based in the border areas drug corridors run from the guainía and vichada departments in colombia to brazil and venezuela using river networks and clandestine airstrips along the banks from which planes reportedly leave for international destinations for farc dissidents and eln members sceptical of peace with the colombian government venezuela will likely remain a safe haven as long as the government in caracas does not change despite bogotá s impassioned protests some farc fighters who demobilised in 2017 are believed to have joined dissident groups that operate along colombia s eastern border and in venezuela several eln combatants also left for venezuela after iván duque was elected president in june 2018 and once peace talks came to a standstill in september both colombia s high commissioner for peace miguel ceballos and foreign minister carlos holmes trujillo reiterated at the start of 2019 and before the bogotá bomb attack that a peace deal with the eln would remain impossible if venezuela continues to harbour the guerrilla group especially its members facing international arrest warrants c illegal business and social control lucrative mining operations are not the only draw for criminal groups seeking to make money in southern venezuela easily recruited adolescents from remote and poor indigenous communities a drugs corridor toward caribbean north american and european markets and corruptible local security forces converge to create a climate conducive to many forms of illicit activity the sindicatos control a broad portfolio of illegal activities including extortion money laundering and drug trafficking and impose their own strict rules over these rackets and the communities where they operate in a village near the mines of las claritas locals wait in front of an empty cockfighting arena to visit the crime boss and ask for favours or for him to settle disputes the sindicato resolves local conflicts with an iron fist imposing fines or disciplinary measures that include forced community labour the sindicatos capacity for armed violence is also striking in the mining town of el dorado bolívar state one particularly violent sindicato attacks other groups led by competing pranes with shows of overpowering force they are an elite group that manage parts of the population in el dorado for example they have about 400 on motorcycles and about 120 to drive the motorboats if they attack they do so in groups of 100 to 150 the sindicatos and guerrillas have troubled relationships with the miners themselves miners who formerly worked in amazonas and bolívar said they preferred the guerrillas to the sindicatos and the national guard all criminal groups and guerrillas levy taxes on mineral extraction and transport calculating the amount miners owe based on the size of their operations miners in turn usually make payments in gold sindicatos summarily execute those who fail to pay the agreed quota whereas the guerrillas tend to give a miner more time to make the payment a recent case of a 19 year old army deserter who stole from the mines close to el callao bolívar state illustrated the gruesome punishments sindicatos mete out the young man was found alive with his hands amputated eyes gouged out and tongue cut off however the guerrillas also reportedly resort to beatings and public executions including for such crimes as bringing a mobile phone to the mines drugs and alcohol are prohibited in mines under guerrilla control with the exception of a small party that is thrown at the yapacana mines every fortnight a miner rests after hours of back breaking work in makeshift mining shafts bram ebus infoamazonia iii state policy and illicit linkages in 2016 president maduro announced that 150 multinationals from 35 countries had expressed interest in investing in the orinoco mining arc but any company wishing to operate in the designated area must form a joint venture with a state company which controls a majority stake this means foreign firms have to work in partnership with the venezuelan military top brass which runs the country s public mining companies so far no major deal with foreign firms has materialised following the venezuelan government s initial press declarations announcing new investments in the region and most mines remain under the control of non state armed groups several sources said that parts of the armed forces use their political influence to enrich themselves through illegal mining boosting the mining industry in venezuela s southern regions was problematic from the outset maduro signed the mining arc decree without consultation with or approval by the opposition controlled national assembly as required under the constitution indeed the assembly voted to repeal the decree in june 2016 on the grounds that it had not been consulted and argued that the 112 000 square kilometre mining zone overlaps with several protected areas such as forest reserves and national parks including a unesco world heritage site the canaima national park nor did the government carry out obligatory socio environmental impact studies or consult with indigenous communities beforehand in accordance with venezuela s constitution a the mining arc and the military active or retired military officers are involved in about 30 per cent of state companies in venezuela and are present on all boards of directors of state firms dedicated to mining one of these is camimpeg a military mining oil and gas company created in 2016 defence minister gen vladimir padrino lópez announced in august 2016 that the armed forces would not only protect mining infrastructure but also participate in local economic development projects through a civil military union in practice this has taken the form of military economic zones these zones which include the orinoco mining arc provide greater freedom for the military to engage in business activity several sources said that parts of the armed forces especially the army and the national guard use their political influence to enrich themselves through illegal mining with eyewitnesses reporting that guardsmen and soldiers charged miners a percentage of gold production and demanded extortion payments on routes to and from the mines in el callao venezuela s historic mining town an official working for state mining company minerven admitted that the firm gets its gold from illegal mining projects which are allegedly run by sindicatos miners from both bolívar and amazonas states explain that a tax in gold needs to be paid to the national guard the guard also operates at least three checkpoints to tax merchandise transported by river to the yapacana mines where payments are made in colombian pesos or u s dollars on the way back extortion fees are paid in gold one former venezuelan army general has said that the military facilitates clandestine flights transporting minerals to caribbean destinations by taking them off the radar meanwhile colombian coltan traffickers buying in venezuela need to deal directly with a national guard commander according to a local trader soldiers visit a project where gold from different informal mines is processed most of it is subsequently sold to state company minerven despite its illegal origin bram ebus the government responded to reports of illegal mining by arresting minerven s vice president doarwin alan evans for gold trafficking on 25 june last year his arrest formed part of a wider operation called manos de metal metal hands in which venezuelan prosecutors targeted 39 gold traffickers critics of the government however have argued that this sudden crackdown was not aimed at countering illegal gold exports but on installing loyal operatives in crucial positions along the supply line b protection rackets miners pay protection fees or taxes in relatively small quantities of gold but make frequent instalments these amounts increase considerably when the eln or the sindicatos pay off government officials mineral traders report that senior authorities take kilograms of gold as bribes they say for example that top military officers in amazonas state receive at least 20kg in gold every month valued at about 800 000 to allow illegal mining in yapacana this helps explain why senior army positions in the region especially in bolívar state are among the most popular postings in venezuela these generals are often rotated helping to foster expectations and buttress loyalty to the government in senior military circles gold from amazonas state says a former venezuelan intelligence officer ends up via extortion payments in the hands of regional heads of the security forces and intelligence bureaus failures to pay expected kickbacks have caused tensions between the national guard and the guerrillas according to miners in yapacana with one witness reporting an incident where guerrilla fighters shot directly at a venezuelan army helicopter in a bid to make it crash armed indigenous communities also threw the national guard out of the alto orinoco municipality after tiring of repeated abuses and extortion demands seizing on reports of deep state involvement in the illegal gold trade and aiming to further undermine the maduro government the u s has taken action following venezuela s export of 21 tonnes of gold to turkey in 2018 for example washington claimed via an executive order on 1 november that gold exports were being used to enrich venezuela s political and economic elite at the cost of increasing violence and human rights abuses in the country s south and would be considered liable for future sanctions however no sanctions have yet been applied turkey has been named as the main known purchaser of venezuelan gold and food products for use in state subsidised rations boxes have reportedly been transported from turkey to venezuela as part of the arrangement however and although gold smuggling is associated with crimes that harm local communities imposing sanctions on state gold exports could be misguided because most gold already leaves venezuela via contraband routes sanctions would probably only increase the volume of smuggled gold and thereby the revenues of organised crime networks guerrillas and corrupt government officials gold can be trafficked to neighbouring countries where it would receive a certificate of origin which would be an illegal but effective way to circumvent any sanctions iv social and humanitarian effects limited state presence and scant economic opportunities are the norm across southern venezuela as well as in the adjacent colombian departments of vichada and guainía these conditions make the regions propitious for illicit activity while also exposing many communities particularly of indigenous peoples to dire humanitarian and environmental risks a poverty and isolation the october 2018 orinoco river floods which almost washed away indigenous communities on the riverbanks and inundated urban centres laid bare the vulnerability of many local people to natural disasters and the difficulties in mounting any emergency response infrastructure is a rarity there is no road access to puerto inírida capital of guainía department and the road to puerto carreño capital of vichada is only passable in the dry season main rivers and hundreds of tributaries serve as the principal routes for transport and communication with limited state control over movements of goods and people apart from the few jobs available with municipal and departmental authorities formal employment is virtually non existent before the onset of the mining boom the inhabitants of guainía lived off rubber plantations the trade in the teeth and skin of wild cats and coca cultivation in 2017 the amazonian regions of colombia saw a 6 per cent increase in coca cultivation though local government sources argue this underestimates reality and satellite imaging cannot detect much of the region s coca farc dissident factions associated with coca growing have grown in size on both sides of the guaviare river between puerto inírida and barranco minas the medications available have not stopped the malaria epidemic among miners due to incorrect dosage levels and a lack of expert medical attention the lack of fuel in venezuela has greatly aggravated these harsh economic conditions remote communities which used to be accessible by water can no longer be reached due to the difficulties of sourcing fuel for small boats indigenous people stranded in puerto ayacucho have been unable to return to their communities in months and are often dependent on sporadically available seats on military flights fuel is frequently acquired in colombia where it is far more expensive than in venezuela and transported to the mines where its value increases significantly even the expensive fuel bought in colombia can be sold at twice the price in mines in venezuela in addition each barrel of 55 gallons heading to the mines was taxed us 6 by the eln in 2017 levies have reportedly risen since then a similar diversion toward the mines affects the supply of medicines which suffer chronic shortages across the country a former venezuelan intelligence officer with excellent knowledge of the region explained all the food was transported to the mines became scarce in i was told that you could find everything that was missing in the mines everything all the medicines you would normally have in a pharmacy are available there however the medications available have not stopped the malaria epidemic among miners due to incorrect dosage levels and a lack of expert medical attention public resentment over the economic hardships and difficulties of travelling or transporting goods in southern venezuela exacerbated by the presence of numerous military checkpoints have provoked a series of protests in bolívar state the main road between venezuela and brazil was blocked for more than a week in october last year as the population protested a lack of food and the occupation of indigenous territories by miners if food is available local supermarket owners often demand gold as payment the venezuelan government hands out boxes of basic food supplies at well below market price but the supplies are regarded as inadequate and the allocation system also serves as a means of political control indigenous representatives in amazonas state for example complain that food boxes were withheld after they failed to participate in the 2017 election for a national constituent assembly more recently they report that government officials are pressing them to sign a paper saying they do not want to receive humanitarian aid from abroad tensions between indigenous communities and security forces in bolívar state underlie the extreme violence used to block efforts to bring humanitarian aid into venezuela from brazil on 23 february which led to the deaths of three protesters in the area of gran sabana and the flight into exile of the indigenous mayor of the border town santa elena de uairén security forces were reportedly dispatched to the area alongside dozens of buses filled with pro government militia known as colectivos b health and the environment mining has had an especially devastating impact on indigenous communities the mercury used to extract gold from ore contaminates the earth and aquifers so much so that in 2017 a test population living along the guainía inírida and atabapo rivers was found to have about 60 times the maximum recommended level of mercury in their blood in venezuela 92 per cent of the indigenous women surveyed in the caura river basin had mercury levels above the 2 milligrams per kilo limit established by the world health organization who and 37 per cent of women among yé kuana and sanema peoples faced childbirth complications related to mercury exposure the damage to public health from mining extends far beyond indigenous communities venezuelans from all regions of the country travel to the mining zones searching for means of survival and if possible riches when they return to their families they bring with them not just a few grams of gold but also infectious diseases a problem made worse by the collapse of venezuela s health service even primary health care modules set up in poor neighbourhoods or rural areas under chávez have mostly shut down due to a lack of funds and at least 26 160 doctors have emigrated due to the economic crisis in 1961 according to the who venezuela became the first country to eradicate malaria in densely populated areas and by the 1980s the disease had almost been eradicated nationwide but due to inadequate prevention efforts and a lack of prophylactic medicines a malaria epidemic has returned there were officially 242 976 cases of malaria in 2016 and 406 289 in 2017 in bolívar state alone more than 200 000 cases were registered in 2017 more than 10 per cent of the local population nationwide it is estimated there were 600 000 cases in the year to november 2018 the stagnant water in the lagoons created by mining activities are hotbeds for malaria mosquitos and contribute to the epidemic in southern venezuela bram ebus malaria in the amazon is linked to mining and deforestation especially in the municipalities of sifontes el callao angostura sucre gran sabana and cedeño all of which are in bolívar state and overlap with the mining arc deforested mining pits full of stagnant waters are excellent breeding grounds for malaria carrying mosquitos miners sleep in makeshift camps and hammocks around these infested waters one investigation by a local ngo calculated that malaria causes 21 percent of the deaths in amazonas and 25 per cent of those in bolívar state the absence of subsidised malaria medication has created a black market in malaria pills for which payment is often made in gold the plague was dropped on us a local leader in ature municipality amazonas said one community in the municipality with close to 600 members sees up to 80 people a week needing treatment in a nearby community more than half of the 2 000 inhabitants suffer malaria ature shares a border with the colombian department of vichada which together with guainía is receiving an increasing number of malaria cases as migrants and refugees carry the disease to the neighbouring country there are currently over a million venezuelan refugees in colombia and foreign minister carlos holmes trujillo has said that in the worst case scenario by 2020 there will be four million close to 95 per cent of foreigners crossing the border with malaria are venezuelans and 55 per cent of venezuelans infected with the disease entered the country through guainía or vichada c community life and criminal control mining is also changing indigenous ways of life from the moment the indigenous don t protect themselves everything is lost one indigenous leader said on both the venezuelan and colombian sides of the border school truancy is rising with the exodus of adolescents heading to work in the mines mining hotspots expose girls to sex work young and sometimes underage girls perform sex work for three to four grams of gold roughly 50 to 60 given the lower value of gold in mining towns while adolescent boys risk their health and lives performing dangerous mining related tasks or exposing themselves to contaminating substances farc dissidents reportedly force young people to go work in the mines you re coming with us if not your families will be military targets is what young and often indigenous recruits for the mines are told by the guerrilla dissidents according to a senior official in the catholic church s social services wing meanwhile across parts of southern venezuela crime syndicates and guerrilla groups are assuming ever greater influence over community life the farc has always had a large social base among indigenous communities which the former guerrillas often targeted for indoctrination the eln and farc dissidents continue to recruit in these communities and have reportedly interfered with local educational programs handing out teaching materials that idealise the guerrillas they have even carried out public works in colombia s vichada department a former farc fighter claimed the guerrillas built about a thousand kilometres of roads some of them fit for motor traffic the presence of the eln in the amazonas state capital of puerto ayacucho has contributed to a massive rise in the homicide rate the city of 41 000 inhabitants saw 38 murders in 2014 and 236 in 2016 in bolívar state the guerrillas have approached communities facing problems with the sindicatos to offer protection against violent criminal gangs the eln also offers weapons along with military and political training in amazonas a teacher said some of her students lived in a nearby eln camp where they receive food and shelter there are camps all over the region of which four are located near the amazonas state capital puerto ayacucho strategies to bring communities under control also include handouts by the eln of state subsidised food packages in at least 40 municipalities in five different states including bolívar and amazonas meanwhile political education in the communities continues five eln run radio stations operate in border areas with colombia strict rules laid down by the eln guerrillas or the farc dissidents may bring a certain level of order to mines under their control but at a high cost many community leaders have reportedly been killed in recent years alcohol and drug consumption are not tolerated and are punishable by death the presence of the eln in the amazonas state capital of puerto ayacucho has contributed to a massive rise in the homicide rate the city of 41 000 inhabitants saw 38 murders in 2014 and 236 in 2016 puerto páez in apure state which also borders colombia has experienced a similar rise which has been attributed to the guerrillas campaigns of social cleansing meanwhile mining communities run by the sindicatos register staggering homicide rates per 100 000 inhabitants these include el callao 620 per 100 000 people in 2018 roscio 458 and sifontes 199 the 2018 national homicide rate in venezuela was calculated at 81 4 per 100 000 the highest in latin america and the caribbean v international risks and responses colombian territory bordering southern venezuela has largely been free of violence due to its low population density and swathes of impenetrable jungle but the rarity of clashes does not signal the absence or inactivity of non state armed groups after serving for many years as a low key trafficking corridor the border region now faces heightened risks of conflict owing to the increasing cross border movement of irregular armed groups at a time of deep mistrust and severed communication between the neighbouring states a armed competition and cross border activity the growing presence of guerrilla units drawn to the mines of southern venezuela has alarmed colombian armed forces in the region sources in the military report that they have increased their defensive presence along the frontier colombian concerns extend not merely to the concentration of guerrilla units in the area but also incursions across the border by venezuelan military forces the national guard has entered colombia on a number of occasions for reasons that remain unclear in september 2018 for example the national guard entered the area called el mantequero vichada department vandalising community facilities and stealing merchandise meanwhile volatile and sometimes competitive relations between parts of the venezuelan military and armed groups in mining zones generate their own violent frictions in one notable incident the eln killed several national guardsmen on 1 november 2018 to retaliate for the arrest of their leader luis felipe ortega bernal also known as garganta in the aftermath of these clashes several more skirmishes took place in amazonas venezuela evidence suggests that the relationship between venezuela s armed forces and colombian guerrillas is highly unstable in the mines in and around yapacana local residents also report occasional clashes between farc dissidents and the venezuelan army these clashes suggest that not all parts of the venezuelan government or security establishment are content to tolerate or abet the expansion of the eln or farc dissidents indeed future clashes among the sindicatos venezuelan armed forces and colombian guerrillas remain likely especially because the military appears to have withdrawn support for most of the sindicatos while state backing for the colombian guerrillas is far from uniform local leadership of the armed forces rotates frequently and not all military officers deployed to the region are on good terms with the guerrillas meanwhile alleged incursions into sindicato controlled mining areas by the venezuelan armed forces or intelligence units have reportedly left behind a trail of killings with no recorded arrests according to retired army general clíver alcalá cordones these orders to kill are not given by the chief of the region when this occurs it is because the order came from caracas guerrilla groups are also operating close to venezuela s eastern border with guyana venezuelan opposition deputy williams dávila ran into an eln roadblock in august 2018 near isla anacoco an area administered by venezuela near the region of esequibo which is part of guyana but claimed by caracas according to a former senior eln figure the group has been active in the disputed border area between venezuela and guyana for about ten years they control two river routes used for smuggling into guyana from san martín de turumbán and five nearby mines besides bordering guyana this area is located about 170 kilometres from the brazilian border they are indoctrinating locals they enter and recruit an indigenous leader stated violent sindicatos displaced by the eln from mining areas in bolívar have also shifted toward the venezuela guyana border causing alarm among guyanese authorities on 13 november a guyanese policeman was shot by a member of a sindicato while travelling on the cuyuní river with guyanese defence forces deployed in the area future skirmishes with the sindicatos or the eln are a real possibility b strategic defence and the eln with years of combat experience in colombia and an acquired mastery of guerrilla warfare the eln s presence in venezuela serves the strategic interests of parts of the state and the armed forces especially given the possibility that an outside power might organise a military intervention to remove maduro or his government precisely what such a foreign military intervention might consist of and how it would fare is uncertain but an army of trained guerrillas at the very least could increase the chances of protracted low intensity conflict especially in the dense jungle regions of southern venezuela where the eln is creating a social support base in the communities in the event of an external military intervention the eln has said it is committed to defending the venezuelan government moreover the end of peace talks between the guerrillas and the colombian government entails the risk of an outright resumption of violent hostilities between bogotá and the insurgency with the focus of colombia s political leaders and armed forces likely to shift toward the eln presence in venezuela if the two sides fail to restart negotiations the eln could well intensify offensive activities while making use of a much stronger base in venezuela where the group can now count on money resources manpower weapons and a safe haven in fact the group is now closer to achieving the continental guerrilla force they have long sought to create with combatants present in at least four different countries colombia venezuela ecuador and guyana near the border with brazil this allows the eln to claim the mantle of latin america s largest guerrilla group any attempt by colombian forces to intervene in southern venezuela against the eln would be extremely perilous and risk provoking greater violence despite the many obstacles to restarting peace talks with the eln returning to negotiations is now even more urgent the guerrillas safe haven in venezuela makes it virtually impossible for colombian forces to defeat the group militarily without either the cooperation of the venezuelan government likely requiring a change in power in caracas or an unbidden incursion into venezuelan territory any attempt by colombian forces to intervene in southern venezuela against the eln would be extremely perilous and risk provoking greater violence and harm to civilians given the guerrillas presence in and control over communities while also pushing the rebels further into border areas adjoining guyana and brazil unless the offensive also addresses the drivers of the illegal mining boom and the vulnerabilities of local people rival armed groups may also seek to take advantage of the offensive against the guerrillas to establish their own rule over more mining areas with violence so while conditions are not currently favourable colombia and international partners should not rule out future talks with the guerrillas armed forces in these two countries also need to take urgent steps to avoid becoming drawn into a bigger fight as a result of cross border movements and attacks from guerrillas or other armed groups preserving lines of communication between the heads of armed units stationed on the border will be essential at the same time foreign powers should refrain from threatening military intervention in venezuela as this provides further incentives for the maduro government to strengthen its links to colombian armed non state actors and to encourage them to remain close to the border areas so that they can react in the event of such an intervention c conflict and migration venezuelan refugees and migrants can be found in informal settlements in the colombian towns of puerto carreño and puerto inírida although the main migrant flows into colombia continue to take place further north even though their families have fled venezuela men return to the nearby mines in amazonas to work while their kin remain in colombia inhabitants of these colombian neighbourhoods complain frequently about threats from illegal armed groups underage girls becoming sex workers and lack of access to decent health care these refugees and migrants endure hardship in colombia s southern border towns but stress that they cannot go back to venezuela especially those who have been forcibly displaced by armed groups people who worked in the venezuelan mines and fled to colombia say it has become too violent everybody wants to be boss a former miner explained in relation to the violence adding that the guerrillas had taken over several mines in bolívar where she had previously worked under the sindicatos indigenous leaders opposed to maduro s government or to the presence of the guerrillas are subjected to violence and even assassination some indigenous groups in bolívar and amazonas have armed themselves or been given weapons by the state to fend off violent intruders creating yet more armed actors families working in the mining areas come from far away to look for a new livelihood but expose themselves to extreme health and security risks bram ebus infoamazonia in light of the escalating violence in the region the growing number of armed actors and their effects on migration and refugee flows the colombian government with the support of foreign donors should attend to humanitarian needs along the southern border furthermore the practical difficulties in resuming peace talks between the colombian government and the eln should not lead bogotá to neglect the imperative of averting a resumption of hostilities between the two that would worsen the humanitarian crisis d cleaning up the gold trade foreign powers need to find alternatives to imposing sanctions on gold exports which as noted boosts trafficking and criminal control over the trade at present much of the gold extracted in southern venezuela is smuggled into neighbouring countries and islands in the caribbean region and subsequently legalised there thereby changing the gold s reported country of origin as a result companies importing gold from latin america and the caribbean cannot simply rely on official customs documents as proof that gold has not been mined illegally in venezuela one possible alternative approach would be to encourage countries in which gold is traded to take additional steps to ensure that mineral trading companies and all firms connected to the business adhere to strict due diligence guidelines these include supply chain checks based on international standards from the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd such as those enshrined in the dodd frank act for u s companies signed into law in july 2010 and the eu supply chain due diligence obligations concerning minerals from conflict affected and high risk areas which enter fully into force in 2021 supply chain due diligence can be an effective alternative to unilateral sanctions if implemented in full and rigorously applied due diligence guidance from the oecd provides an international benchmark for efforts to clean up mineral supply chains currently 35 oecd member states and eight non members including colombia and brazil have signed up to these guidelines which set down standards for mineral trading firms and mandate regular reports and independent audits from signatory countries these standards are voluntary commitments that companies are encouraged to adopt however and individual member states decide whether to make them legally binding or not so far they have been introduced into law by the u s through the dodd frank act and by countries where natural resources have been linked to conflict and human rights abuses such as the democratic republic of congo rwanda and burundi supply chain due diligence can be an effective alternative to unilateral sanctions if implemented in full and rigorously applied it would not prevent companies buying and trading gold from venezuela or other countries in latin america but would require those doing so as well as associated financial institutions and commodity exchanges to show they are employing appropriate care to ensure they know the legal origin of the minerals and are not funding armed groups sanctioned regimes or human rights abusers although these measures would not transform venezuelan gold production instantly they would place pressure on major parts of the supply chain to halt these abuses vi conclusion security in southern venezuela has deteriorated alarmingly in recent years as various armed state and non state actors compete over access to natural resources and prey on local populations in their struggle for power and territorial control venezuela s armed forces the most visible state presence in the region have not merely failed to avert this violence but according to numerous eyewitness accounts have abetted and profited from the pillaging of minerals across a land corridor starting at the colombian border and extending to brazil and guyana alienated from the state and impoverished in the wake of venezuela s economic collapse many local people have been drawn into the clutches of armed groups and the lifeline that illicit mining provides against a backdrop of total estrangement between the incumbent venezuelan government and its neighbours colombia and brazil cross border movements of guerrillas with links to venezuelan security forces pose clear dangers for regional stability threats of an invasion from outside powers exacerbate border tensions and if carried out could inflict greater suffering on civilians and plunge the region into violent fighting between rival armed factions the brittle and volatile alliances among various armed actors in southern venezuela heighten these risks frequent clashes among them and shifts in their power and support base expose the region and the border areas with colombia and guyana in particular to unexpected spikes in armed violence and to the forced displacement of local populations both neighbouring countries and the venezuelan government should acknowledge the risks of border violence and the potential for worsening regional hostilities even as the political crisis in venezuela unfolds neighbouring countries and concerned foreign states should seek to mitigate both the threat of a broader regional crisis and the dangers local communities face this means that whatever their political differences both neighbouring countries and the venezuelan government should acknowledge the risks of border violence and the potential for worsening regional hostilities as a result they should seek to maintain stable channels of communication between their armed forces and between top political officials it also means that un agencies should respond to worsening conflict human rights abuses and health risks and tend to the humanitarian needs of residents and refugees across southern venezuela and adjacent border areas venezuela for its part should stop impeding international aid agencies wishing to assist vulnerable populations while colombia should not close the door on future talks with the eln a military intervention aimed at striking the guerrillas venezuelan bases which could inflame already heightened tensions must be avoided lastly the u s should refrain from imposing sanctions on gold production and exports aimed at punishing and financially isolating venezuelan government and military elites nor is it realistic in current circumstances to propose the immediate creation of a legal mining sector all minerals leaving venezuela are linked to illicit activities to some degree instead oecd member states that are already signatories to initiatives aimed at reducing the trade in minerals from conflict zones should introduce proper due diligence standards into law these should apply to all companies involved in trading minerals leaving venezuela and countries in latin america and the caribbean through which illegal venezuelan minerals pass with the aim of encouraging the gradual establishment of legal mining practices in the country the fate of bolívar and amazonas is inextricably linked to venezuela s political future and questions of whether and when it will exit its current quagmire but the suffering and extreme isolation of local communities as well as the threats that mining riches and armed factions pose across the region should put the south at the centre of concern for the future of venezuela

windhoek with the date of the tabling of the national budget confirmed for wednesday 13 march 2019 economists have pointed out the bloated wage bill under performing public enterprises including a review of the public sector and the budget deficit as some of the most crucial aspects that finance minister calle schlettwein needs to address natural attrition does not address the real issue of a bloated civil service trade unions demand salary increments for public sector employees and economic growth projections for 2019 do not indicate a reduction in the number of public servants state of public enterprises and fiscal risks concerning their ability to repay debts even public enterprises that are currently regarded as doing well could come under financial pressure how to finance major infrastructure projects such as the expansion of the hosea kutako international airport how to reduce the budget deficit and public debts what is being done to ensure that namibia can repay the first eurobond in two years economist klaus schade said these are some of the major aspects of the budget that schlettwein needs to address however schade cautioned that reducing the wage bill cannot be done in the short term but needs a medium term coherent strategy in addition he suggests that the privatisation or partial privatisation of public enterprises could be considered schade a research associate at the economic association of namibia further note that if domestic liquidity allows borrowing locally should be prioritised as it excludes any exchange rate risk and it provides income locally in the form of interest payments government could issue longer term government bonds rather than short term treasury bills to improve public debt management schade recommended commenting on the budget deficit schade noted that there might not be sufficient liquidity in the local market which would force government to borrow abroad if the budget deficit cannot be reduced this borrowing in turn could increase the country s budget deficit which would most likely result in namibia being downgraded by sovereign rating agencies which would increase the cost of borrowing and hence statutory expenditure a downgrade schade cautioned could prevent some foreign investors from investing in the country in the current economic climate it is certainly not advisable to increase taxes except for the annual increase in excise duties which is decided at the sacu level hence government needs to focus on controlling expenditure including subsidies to public enterprises said schade he continued that income tax and value added tax could come under pressure due to increased unemployment and hence reduced income and spending power revenue from diamond royalties and income tax from diamond mining companies could come under pressure due to expected subdued demand for diamonds in the two major markets china and usa likewise sacu transfers could come under pressure because of sluggish economic growth in south africa compounded by recent load shedding schade concluded also weighing in on the expected budget economist and managing director of twilight capital consulting mally likukela pointed out that schlettwein is navigating troubled waters not of his own making i would rather have him push back the date for a balanced budget than continue to cut his way to one as doing so continues to hurt the economy as it is the case right now this year more than ever before his budget speech which is expected mostly to focus on debt reduction strategies will undoubtedly trigger politically polarized debates said likukela he emphasised that currently standing at more than 45 percent the public debt has become unsustainable and he expects this to soon cause bond yields higher interest payments to rise and in the worst case lead to a loss of confidence in the government as already hinted by various rating agencies such as moody s and fitch then to reduce fiscal deficits likukela suggests using a combination of policies at its disposal but said a key factor is the timing of deficit reduction strategies if the country is already in recession as is the case for namibia it is much more difficult to reduce the deficit because fiscal consolidation can simply worsen the economic situation leading to lower tax revenues continuing with fiscal consolidation right now will be self defeating the best way to reduce the budget deficit is to aim for positive economic growth but in the long term evaluate government spending commitments and reduce spending to sustainable levels said likukela
external trade environment and the implications for tt trade tensions us president donald trump left and us trade representative robert lighthizer second from right talk with chinese vice premier liu he second from left during their meeting in the oval office of the white house in washington last friday external risks including political uncertainty in venezuela brexit trade tensions between china and the us volatile energy commodity process and swings in financial markets could affect tt s economic outlook for 2019 domestic macroeconomic management then will need to be closely coordinated and alert in dealing with a rapidly evolving external landscape the following is an analysis of the tt economy in the context of global conditions reproduced with permission from the central bank of trinidad and tobago s economic bulletin for january 2019 it has been lightly edited for clarity the turbulent global trade environment during 2018 resulted in a loss of global growth momentum in 2018 compared to 2017 the muted expansion in economic activity in 2018 was partly reflective of escalating trade tensions between the us and key trading partners the uncertainty surrounding the renegotiations of the north american free trade agreement nafta and the prolonged unpredictability related to the uk s impending exit from the european union eu against this backdrop the international monetary fund imf revised downward its 2019 economic growth forecasts for the us uk china and mexico protectionist actions by the us and its largest trading partner china continue to pose a downside risk to global growth in 2019 the trade dispute between the us and china involved the us imposition of a ten per cent tariff on all aluminium imports a 25 per cent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 per cent tariff on us 50 billion worth of other chinese imports also a ten per cent tariff levied on us 200 billion of imports from china was earmarked to be increased to 25 per cent at the beginning of 2019 the sectors targeted by us tariffs include products used for robotics information technology communication technology and aerospace china responded with tariffs of an equivalent amount on us exports covering goods such as soybeans pork fruits cars and whiskey amongst others according to the imf global gdp is expected to fall by more than 0 8 per cent in 2020 and remain roughly 0 4 per cent lower in the long run compared to the baseline scenario without trade tensions the disruption caused by the escalation of trade restrictions could be particularly large in the us and china with gdp losses of more than 0 9 per cent in the us and over 1 6 per cent in china in 2019 following the december 2018 g20 summit a 90 day halt on additional trade measures was agreed upon by the us and china to facilitate trade negotiations at the same meeting the renegotiated nafta renamed the united states mexico canada agreement usmca was signed although not yet ratified by member countries the signing of the agreement has lowered a key downside threat to global economic growth the usmca will replace the 25 year old nafta with the biggest changes emanating from rules governing the country of origin labour provisions us access to the canadian dairy market intellectual property and digital trade tariff protections and a sunset clause before the signing of the new agreement the imf simulated that gdp in the nafta trading partners was likely to be more than 1 6 per cent lower in 2020 than in the absence of us tariff measures meanwhile the uncertain outcome of brexit has negatively impacted the uk s business investment in 2018 the uk s withdrawal from the eu would result in a reduction in its access to the eu market through higher trade barriers as it will no longer be a member of the single market trading bloc in addition the uk s ability to export to third party countries under the eu s negotiated trade deals may also be compromised as the uk will lose access to trade agreements that it had by virtue of being an eu member however the net impact on trade will depend on the terms and conditions of the withdrawal agreement trade frictions and the lower potential growth of these economies have several implications for tt over the period 2011 to october 2018 the us accounted for an average of 38 5 per cent of tt exports while the uk eu china and mexico collectively accounted for an average of 4 4 per cent of tt exports over the same period as a result reduced demand for tt exports from these countries can significantly impact the domestic economy trade in services particularly travel services may also be negatively impacted by reduced external demand since visitor arrivals in tt have been mainly dominated by the us in addition the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec noted that the decline in oil prices in october and november 2018 was due among other things to slowing global economic momentum amid us china trade tensions lower energy prices could lead to a potential reduction in tt s export earnings and a deterioration of the surplus on the external current account tt s exports may also suffer from the brexit outcome given that the uk s growth is anticipated to decelerate post brexit and particularly if the eucariforum economic partnership agreement is to be renegotiated on the other hand the imposition of tariffs on us goods by china may create opportunities for tt to increase its exports of similar goods to the chinese market the chinese government imposed a ten per cent tariff on us liquefied natural gas lng of particular interest china is the world s second largest natural gas importer whilst trinidad and tobago is in the world s top ten exporters of lng as such the higher cost of us lng can push china to substitute to lng from tt while tt s main export commodities continue to be energy or energy related products opportunities for the promotion of non energy exports also exist following exports of mineral fuels and chemical products manufactured commodities represent the third largest category of exports from tt in 2018 with the us accounting for approximately 80 per cent of domestic manufacturing exports a national thrust into the development of these export categories can facilitate greater sustainability in export earnings for the domestic economy

during the three months ended december 31 2018 strad reported a net loss of 5 4 million compared to a net loss of 3 4 million in 2017 the higher net loss in 2018 was due to the recognition of a 10 9 million impairment in equipment rentals as a result of the deteriorating outlook for the canadian market for the three months ended december 31 2018 strad s industrial matting segment reported an increase in revenue and ebitda of 48 and 93 as compared to the same period in 2017 earnings before interest and taxes ebit from industrial matting increased from 0 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 4 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in revenue ebitda and ebit was a result of a significant matting project in canada that occurred throughout the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as an 83 increase in u s revenue year over year the increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was also impacted by improved customer pricing as compared to the same period in 2017 strad s equipment rentals segment reported a decrease in revenue and an increase in ebitda of 8 and 78 respectively during the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 the decrease in revenue was a result of lower revenue in canada due to the discontinuance of the drill cuttings management service line which was mostly offset by an increase in pricing and utilization in the u s during the fourth quarter of 2018 capital expenditures were 12 0 million in industrial matting 0 1 million in equipment rentals and 0 1 million in corporate the majority of the capital spending related to wood matting additions which were acquired to prepare for and to support industrial matting projects for the upcoming 2019 year as of december 31 2018 the industrial matting fleet was 111 710 as compared to 101 210 at september 30 2018 outlook we continued to execute on our industrial matting strategy announced in 2018 with company ebitda for the year totaling 27 2 million compared to 25 0 million in the prior year industrial matting ebitda totaled 21 5 million compared to 21 2 million in the prior year while equipment rentals contributed 8 7 million compared to 7 8 million in the prior year despite a challenging macro economic environment the fourth quarter of 2018 was our strongest quarter since 2014 financial results for the quarter were attributed primarily to the strong margins in the industrial matting segment posting 8 3 million of ebitda compared to 4 3 million for the same period in 2017 results for the quarter were propelled by a large matting project related to the north montney mainline we believe strongly in the opportunities presented in both canada and the u s for our industrial matting segment formal approval of the lng canada project and associated coastal gaslink pipeline will provide significant opportunity for the industrial matting segment in 2019 the trans mountain expansion project will similarly provide opportunities for strad however any delay in construction could impact timing of potential matting projects in 2019 we will look to employ our expertise in deploying large scale matting projects in the u s market with increasing environmental responsibility and regulation throughout north america we expect the overall matting market to increase as we also look to increase our market share our internal estimates place the current market size for matting in north america at over 2 0 billion annually and growing consistent with our strategy to grow our matting fleet we deployed 31 3 million of capital to maintain and increase our fleet in 2018 the remainder of our 33 8 million capital program was comprised of maintenance capital and technology enhancements our board has approved a 2019 capital program of 18 0 million with the expectation that total capital spend in 2019 will be approximately 30 0 million of which 29 0 million will be allocated to maintaining and growing the industrial matting fleet the equipment rentals market in canada saw a dramatic shift in macro economic conditions in the fourth quarter market access restrictions in canada culminated in average western canadian select wcs pricing of under six us dollars per barrel in december 2018 a decline of over 85 from the prior year these conditions have led to initial reductions in 2019 capital budgets by major canadian producers which have impacted first quarter 2019 rig counts and expected activity levels in the equipment rentals segment throughout the first half of 2019 in the u s the outlook for equipment rentals remains consistent with 2018 as west texas intermediate wti pricing has remained relatively consistent drilling activity is expected to be stable throughout 2019 in the u s on november 26 2018 we announced the approval from the toronto stock exchange to renew our normal course issuer bid ncib allowing us to buy back a maximum of 4 067 205 common shares the ncib commenced on november 28 2018 and will terminate november 27 2019 subsequent to year end the company purchased 471 408 common shares under the ncib under our previous ncib which expired september 13 2018 we purchased and canceled 2 768 320 or 5 of the outstanding common shares in 2018 our funds from operations allowed us to increase our capital program repurchase shares under our ncib while carrying a minimal amount of debt we expect this trend to continue in 2019 as our funds from operations and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to evaluate various alternatives to create shareholder value including without limitation

during the fourth quarter of 2018 ebit increased to 4 8 million compared to 0 7 million during the same period of 2017 the primary driver for the increase in ebit were the same factors that led to the

period of 2017 the primary increase in revenue year over year was due to the 119 increase in u s industrial matting revenue as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 this was offset by the 12 revenue decrease in canada to 43 6 million compared to 49 8 million during the same period in 2017 due to the delay of matting projects until the fourth quarter of 2018 which led to a decrease in

the decrease in depreciation expense is due to the accelerated depreciation of mats with no remaining useful life during 2017 that did not occur in 2018 operating expenses for the three months and

in canada was the result of a 6 decline in average rig counts and the discontinuance of the drill cuttings management service line the decrease in canadian revenue was offset by the 31 increase in u s

and payout ratio 2 for more information on the restatement please refer to the accounting changes section of the management s discussion and analysis for the fourth quarter and year end 2018 three month period ended december 31 2018 production increased 58 compared to the same quarter last year the corporation s facilities produced 1 747 708 mwh of electricity or 102 of the lta of 1 719 485 mwh overall the hydroelectric facilities produced 91 of their lta the wind farms produced 106 of their lta the solar farms produced 82 of their lta and the geothermal facilities produced 110 of their lta the corporation recorded revenues of 166 2 million up 54 and adjusted ebitda of 113 2 million up 41 mainly due to the contribution of the geothermal facilities acquired as part of alterra in february 2018 to the 62 interest in the cartier wind farms acquired in october 2018 and to higher production at the upper lillooet river hydro facility and french wind facilities the adjusted ebitda margin decreased from 74 1 to 68 1 for the three month period due mainly to changes in our mix of segments as geothermal operations have a lower ebitda margin due to their higher maintenance daily operating costs and power purchasing costs the adjusted ebitda proportionate reached 133 0 million up 60 due mainly to higher adjusted ebitda and a higher innergex s share of adjusted ebitda of joint ventures and associates stemming from the addition of the facilities acquired as part of alterra and energía llaima in 2018 for the three month period ended december 31 2018 the corporation recorded net earnings of 14 0 million basic and diluted net earnings of 0 10 per share compared with net earnings of 3 5 million basic and diluted net earnings of 0 05 per share for the corresponding period in 2017 the 10 4 million increase in net earnings can be explained by the 33 1 million increase in adjusted ebitda and by the 15 0 million positive change in the share of earnings of joint ventures and associates partly offset by the 15 0 million increase in finance costs 13 9 million increase in depreciation and amortization and 6 7 million increase in other net expenses year ended december 31 2018 production increased 43 compared to last year the corporation s facilities produced 6 283 436 mwh of electricity or 98 of the lta of 6 437 964 mwh overall the hydroelectric facilities produced 94 of

million up 44 and adjusted ebitda of 385 1 million up 29 due mainly to the contribution of the geothermal facilities acquired as part of alterra in february 2018 the french wind facilities acquired in 2017 and the 62 interest in the cartier wind farms acquired in october 2018 the adjusted ebitda margin decreased from 74 6 to 66 8 for the year due mainly to the same factors as for the three month period the year s margin was also impacted by challenging post commissioning activities that have been mostly addressed at the upper lillooet river facility the adjusted ebitda proportionate reached 459 1 million up 49 mainly due to the addition of the facilities acquired in 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 the corporation recorded net earnings of 25 7 million basic and diluted net earnings of 0 21 per share compared with net earnings of 19 1 million basic and diluted net earnings of 0 22 per share for the corresponding period in 2017 the 6 6 million increase in net earnings can be explained by the 86 4 million increase in adjusted ebitda 29 5 million positive change in the share of earnings of joint ventures and associates and 4 4 million positive change in income taxes partly offset by the 52 3 million increase in finance costs the 42 4 million increase in depreciation and amortization the 12 8 million negative change in other net expenses revenues and the 6 2 million negative change in unrealized net loss gain on financial instruments free cash flow and payout ratio for the year ended december 31 2018 the corporation generated free cash flow of 105 1 million compared with 87 2 million for the corresponding period last year the increase in free cash flow is due mainly to higher cash flows from operating activities before changes in non cash working capital items partly offset by greater scheduled debt principal payments higher free cash flow attributed to non controlling interests and higher maintenance capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals for the year ended december 31 2018 the dividends on common shares declared by the corporation amounted to 86 of free cash flow compared with 82 for the corresponding period last year this change results mainly from higher dividend payments as a result of the issuance of 24 327 225 shares on february 6 2018 related to the alterra acquisition to the increase in the quarterly dividend to additional shares following the exercise of share options and to additional shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan drip fourth quarter operational highlights on october 22 2018 innergex

joining for q a following our prepared remarks we will open the call for questions with that i d like to turn the call over to tom thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you ian and welcome everyone 2018 was another exceptional year for park and its shareholders as we successfully achieved the strategic goals we outlined 12 months ago for our internal growth efforts we focused on operational excellence by improving profitability across our portfolio through a combination of revpar growth grouping up strategies and margin expansion as a result our operational results came in above expectations with the portfolio generating solid revpar growth of 2 9 while our initiatives to aggressively asset manage the portfolio contributed to the 60 basis point increase in our margins materially outperforming our peer set on average advertisement advertisement with respect to capital allocation we successfully recycled 13 non core assets the gross proceeds of 519 million greatly enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio while lowering our exposure to international markets to just 1 of total ebitda finally in 2018 we returned over 900 million of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and the hna stock buyback taking our total return on capital figure to nearly 1 9 billion since spinning out from hilton a little over two years ago overall these efforts have allowed park to generate superior shareholder returns outperforming our hotel reit peers by nearly 1 400 basis points and the broader reit index by nearly 400 basis points while significantly narrowing the valuation gap with our peers overall i couldn t be prouder of our success and in particular the hard work and dedication put forth by the entire team at park as i look ahead to 2019 i remain confident in our ability to continue achieving our objectives while we recognize there is heightened concern about slower economic growth and ongoing cost pressures we believe park is well positioned relative to our peers as we have prepared ourselves to reap the benefits of strong group demand across several of our key markets as we have noted in the past grouping up will be a key focus for park for the next couple of years and should help to support above industry average revpar growth through 2020 additionally fueled in large part by the success of our grouping up efforts we expect to continue narrowing the margin gap with our peers forecasting another 30 basis points of absolute margin growth at the midpoint of our guidance range in 2019 turning to our portfolio s performance i am pleased with our overall results for both the quarter and full year 2018 comparable revpar growth was 2 9 for the year which was at the top end of our guidance range with the fourth quarter revpar growth topping 3 6 or nearly 100 basis points ahead of consensus our comparable hotel adjusted ebitda margin increased 40 basis points during the fourth quarter and improved by nearly 60 basis points for the year helping to continue closing the margin gap with our peers advertisement advertisement our asset management team has done a terrific job partnering with hilton and sourcing both revenue and cost saving opportunities across several of our key properties as witnessed by our growth throughout the quarter and the year these initiatives continue to remain a key driver for our internal growth story within our revenue segments group was up 3 8 for the quarter and 5 for the year at this time last year we had expected pace to be up approximately 3 in 2018 and we are very pleased with the increase in group pace throughout the year on the transient side comparable revenue increased 1 7 for the quarter and it was down just 0 1 for the year the fourth quarter was boosted by a healthy increase in the business transient segment which was up 4 2 and was partially offset by 0 4 decrease in leisure revenue overall 2019 is off to a very strong start with january revpar up approximately 6 or 3 when stripping out san francisco february is also trending above 7 and we expect the first quarter to realize about 4 to 5 revpar growth looking more closely at our quarterly performance across our core markets standouts include key west with revpar up nearly 32 or 290 basis points better than we had forecasted driven by strong transient demand we remind listeners that the hotels were closed for 12 days in the fourth quarter of 2017 following hurricane irma which hit the island in september of that year san francisco also surprised to the upside with the hilton union square and parc 55 reporting revpar growth of 13 6 during the fourth quarter both increasing share within the comps set hilton chicago was also strong with revpar growth exceeding 6 for the quarter due to strong group production which helped to drive higher transient rates offsetting these gains were softer results at our hilton hawaiian village hotel with the property reporting a 2 3 decrease in revpar during the quarter driven by slightly weaker group and continued fallout from softer international wholesale demand our hotels still grew share during the quarter to 107 or by 500 basis points continuing a trend we ve seen all year advertisement advertisement also our bonnet creek hotels in orlando reported a 0 2 revpar gain for the quarter as the complex faced tough year over year comps due to strong demand related to displaced residents from hurricane irma in the fourth quarter of 2017 looking ahead in 2019 i remain very optimistic on the fundamentals of our business and particularly our strong group pace group pace for 2019 is up over 10 with hawaii and san francisco both clear standouts with group pace up 23 and 17 respectively while momentum is expected to continue into 2020 with our portfolio s overall group pace up just over 9 next year additionally while convention room nights are down in chicago new york new orleans and orlando this year our group pace across each one of these markets remains positive turning to san francisco with the moscone center renovation complete and convention room nights up 78 to 1 2 million we expect the city to be among our top performers in 2019 with revpar growth forecasted to be in the mid to upper single digits in hawaii we expect our two hotels to collectively generate revpar growth above the top end of our 2019 revpar guidance specifically at our hilton waikoloa village hotel group pace is up nearly 80 with the hotel benefiting from two separate group buyouts while facing easier year over year comps following disruption related to last year s volcanic activity which negatively impacted income by approximately 5 million in 2018 at the hilton hawaiian village results are expected to be driven in part by forecasted increase in group pace of roughly 8 coupled with favorable booking trends in asian wholesale business a reversal of the trend we experienced last year a testament to the team s effort to proactively group up is in an otherwise soft citywide year is best illustrated by both chicago and new york two markets which are expected to witness a 30 plus drop in citywide room nights in 2019 despite these challenges our group pace in chicago was up nearly 8 while in new york we are expecting group pace to be up north of 6 with the hotel also expected to benefit from solid increases in transient demand led by contract and business transient our orlando portfolio should generate positive growth in spite of some of the anticipated renovation displacement during the fourth quarter as we expect to break ground on the meeting space expansion at our bonnet creek complex that will be delivered during the second half of 2021 collectively hawaii san francisco new york chicago and orlando account for over 60 of our comparable hotel adjusted ebitda lending support to our positive view in 2019 fundamentals advertisement advertisement another standout in our portfolio is the hilton santa barbara resort which continues to gain additional momentum and should post very strong results following last year s brand conversion moving on to our capital allocation initiatives building on last year s success phase 2 of our non core asset sale program is well under way having recently reported the sale of the hilton squaw peak resort for 51 million with net proceeds of approximately 48 million to be used for general corporate purposes which could include funding future roi projects as it relates to additional sales we remain committed to our capital recycling efforts with the potential for another five to eight non core hotels in various stages of the marketing process turning toward 2019 guidance while the u s economy remains on firm footing supported by a strong job market healthy corporate profits and a sturdy consumer it is hard to ignore the potential headwinds our industry faces in the wake of slower global growth wage pressures and a risk of an ongoing trade war with china advertisement advertisement that said lodging fundamentals remain sound especially for those companies with the right geographic footprint we believe park is uniquely positioned to benefit from proactively grouping up across many of our core markets including generating strong in house group demand thereby offsetting the impact of weaker citywide calendars across much of the u s with 80 of our group business on the books for this year we remain cautiously optimistic on 2019 accordingly we are establishing comparable revpar guidance of plus 2 to plus 4 for the full year 2019 with a comparable hotel adjusted ebitda margin range of zero to plus 60 basis points our cost containment and ancillary income will remain an important driver of the margin story results will now be more heavily weighted to our grouping up efforts for the full year 2019 despite losing approximately 20 million as a result of the expired ground lease at chicago o hare in addition to residual income from the 14 assets we sold over the prior 12 months we anticipate adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 745 million and 775 million we expect adjusted ffo per share to be in the range of 2 91 to 3 05 sean will provide further details in his remarks on some of the other key assumptions driving our earnings guidance advertisement advertisement and with that i d like to turn the call over to him sean m dell orto executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks tom and welcome everyone looking at our results for the fourth quarter we reported total revenues of 686 million and adjusted ebitda of 184 million while our adjusted ffo was 147 million or 0 73 per diluted share on a full year basis we reported total revenues of approximately 2 7 billion adjusted ebitda of 754 million and adjusted ffo of 603 million or 2 96 per diluted share turning to our core operating metrics for the fourth quarter we reported comparable revpar of 171 or an increase of 3 6 versus the prior year our occupancy for the quarter was 79 7 or 60 basis points higher our average daily rate ended the quarter at 214 or an increase of 2 8 year over year these top line results produced comparable hotel adjusted ebitda of 176 million while our margins increased 40 basis points to 28 2 advertisement advertisement for full year 2018 our comparable portfolio produced a revpar of 174 or an increase of 2 9 our occupancy for the year was 82 up 50 basis points while our average daily rate was 212 or an increase of 2 4 versus the prior year these top line results produced hotel adjusted ebitda of 716 million for our comparable portfolio with margins improving nearly 60 basis points year over year to 28 8 moving to our balance sheet we remain in great shape with no major maturities until 2021 and net debt to adjusted ebitda at just 3 7 times we have over 1 2 billion between our untapped revolver and cash on hand giving us ample liquidity to execute on the right opportunities turning to the dividend with q4 earnings coming in at the high end of our expectations we paid a q4 dividend of 1 per share which included a 0 30 per share component related to excess gains from assets sold during 2018 our board recently declared our first quarter dividend of 0 45 per share to be paid on april 15th to stockholders of record as of march 29th representing a 4 6 increase in our quarterly regular weight dividend similar to last year we are targeting a full year payout ratio of 65 to 70 of adjusted ffo and a potential top up dividend to be paid in the fourth quarter with respect to capex excluding the amount related to caribe hilton we invested 41 million in our hotels during the fourth quarter about half of which was for desk facing areas taking our full year capex spend to 147 million or the roughly 6 of hotel revenues that we targeted at the beginning of the year for 2019 we continue to target 6 maintenance capex spend while our roi pipeline is expected to add an additional 25 million to total capital expenditures for the year given the increased capex spend we expect renovation displacement to negatively impact revpar performance by approximately 70 basis points in 2019 but note that this displacement is already factored into our guidance we are very excited about the renovation projects at both the bonnet creek complex in orlando and norwegian key west with targeted returns in the high teens for both as a reminder total roi spent at bonnet will be approximately 70 million to 80 million over the next 24 months at the reach the scope of the project includes rebranding the hotel from a waldorf astoria to curio in addition to a comprehensive rooms renovation and a restaurant reconcept total roi spend for this project is estimated at 10 million and we expect construction to occur during the slower months of q3 and q4 of this year we hope you are available to join us for our key west property tour we and several of our peers are hosting in april in early april where we expect to have a model room to showcase turning to 2019 earnings guidance i d like to provide a few more details on some of the key assumptions driving our 2019 adjusted ebitda and ffo guidance we would like to point out that there will be some seasonality in our quarterly performance but q1 is expected to be among our strongest quarters given easier year over year comps coupled with very strong group pace during the quarter on the flip side q2 will likely work out to be one of our weaker quarters as several of our major markets faced tough year over year comps including san francisco chicago and new york recall that group revenues during the second quarter of 2018 were up over 17 and therefore group pace is likely to be flat to down slightly during the second quarter we feel very good about the back half of the year though with strong group pace overall and with exceptionally soft performance expected in hawaii san francisco and new york on the margin front while expense growth in 2019 will likely be 50 to 100 basis points higher than the 2 5 increase we witnessed last year we are forecasting margin growth of 30 basis points at the midpoint this year due in large part to healthy increases in f b and catering revenues one of the benefits of a strong group base coupled with high single digit increases in ancillary income including parking revenues from a cost perspective our asset management team working in partnership with hilton continues to focus on all available areas in order to reduce controllable expenses just a couple of housekeeping issues to make sure you ve taken note first as we ve disclosed previously the ground lease at our hilton chicago o hare property expired at the end of 2018 and as expected the city has taken back the 860 room property the hotel accounted for roughly 13 5 million of ebitda contribution last year on a positive note revpar margins at the property ran conservatively lower in our consolidated portfolio average so the net effect of removing the hotel from the comparable portfolio is an approximate 1 10 increase in average revpar for 2018 while comparable hotel adjusted ebitda margin is positively impacted by approximately 20 basis points additionally we are adding the hilton waikoloa village hotel back into our comp set for 2019 since the plan to give back the remaining 466 rooms in the ocean tower does not incur until the end of this year recall that the initial transfer of rooms incurred in 2017 so there is a clean year over year comparison of the hotel s performance in 2019 versus 2018 finally i wanted to provide you with the latest on our redevelopment efforts at the caribe hilton in puerto rico the property currently remains closed with the reopening of the resort expected to occur in may 2019 which will include most of the guestrooms and f b outlets and all the meeting space common areas and amenities regarding the insurance claim during the fourth quarter we received 10 million of insurance proceeds related to business interruption taking full year ebitda for the property up to 11 million after netting out carrying costs and other expenses this also includes a portion of bi related to the impacted months in 2017 total insurance proceeds received to date including the property damage side of the claim are 115 million with the property remaining closed for the next few months we expect to receive additional bi proceeds this year as a reminder the hotel generated approximately 8 million of ebitda on an annual basis prior to the hurricane that concludes our prepared remarks we will now open the line for q a to address each of your questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up operator may we have the first question please questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of bill crow from raymond james please proceed with your question bill crow raymond james analyst hey good morning guys thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey bill how are you bill crow raymond james analyst i m good thank you for asking what is the downside of grouping up what are you giving up and is that a strategy that s only really effective later in the cycle thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it s a great question bill we don t one think they re say they re mutually inclusive we think by grouping up particularly with our top 10 assets or really even our top 25 assets to really play to our natural strength it s a real competitive advantage for us long term now if you think about 2018 as an example so we were up grouped it was up about 5 for the year transient essentially for us was a little better than flat but our contract business is up obviously it s about another 5 of our business north of 21 so effectively what we re doing is we re shrinking the hotel we re anchoring our business with really high quality group business coupled with the fact that we re layering in contract business and then we can more efficiently manage transient and price it accordingly plus all of the other ancillary revenue income that we get by taking advantage of really these large group houses so we actually think it s the prudent business model in the past a lot of hotels were really more focused on transient we think this is really our core strategy moving forward and candidly i think we re proving it out the strength that we expect in 2019 and we don t think this is a one hit wonder we think that this continues into 2020 and also when you look out and seeing both in 2019 and in 2020 where they re not great citywide years across many of the major markets we were proactive and got in front of this a couple of years ago identifying that and fielding partnering with our partners at hilton and just being laser focused on grouping up our business so we see this as a competitive advantage and again playing to the natural strength that we have at park bill crow raymond james analyst yes thanks and speaking of hilton can you maybe frame the risk reward involved in taking the hilton bonnet creek and putting a brand new brand on that property and what are you getting from hilton in order to do that thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it s a fair question bill i would say look we love that resort and we think we ve got huge upside there over 400 acres championship golf course 1 500 rooms orlando as you know is a bit of an arms race so adding more meeting space here is going to be critical to our long term success so we re going to commence obviously with the rooms redo redo the lobby at the hilton clearly add more additional meeting space both at the hilton and at the waldorf and then again we ve got a great confidence in our partners at hilton and as you think about the need for sort of a hilton plus brand assuming it does that the meeting planners have said that they want that sort of upgraded experience we think bonnet creek is a great example of that and we are confident in its long term success there s always a risk but i think hilton has got a demonstrated track record of being able to launch new brands and really this is sort of a brand extension and a brand upgrade of hilton so you re not really taking away from the core benefit of hilton bill crow raymond james analyst okay thank you for your time i appreciate it thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of rich hightower from evercore isi please proceed with your question rich hightower evercore isi analyst hey morning guys thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer morning rich how are you rich hightower evercore isi analyst good thank you tom so a question here with respect to the 2 to 4 revpar guidance can you just help us understand the key variables between the low end and the high end and are those asset specific catalysts in either direction or it s something more broad than that thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer as you think about the year and again as i mentioned in our prepared remarks we benefit obviously from a strong group pace hawaii again going to be up north of 23 and group pace we expect that clearly waikoloa is going to be up almost 80 includes there hilton hawaiian village will be up about 80 so clearly that ll be a very strong performance for us probably mid slightly above probably mid above that in revpar growth san francisco has got obviously have a very strong year as you know citywides being up certainly north of 1 2 million and out of the 78 plus or minus we expect there and we re probably going to do probably 7 to 9 range see how the year unfolds it s off to a great start so far clearly we think chicago is going to have a strong year group pace there and new york city so overall it s pretty well diversified it s not just dependent on those two markets so we feel comfortable where we are and if any indication again we re coming on the heels of the first quarter becoming against sort of a 1 1 1 i think growth in 2017 excuse me 2018 there so as we think about this year we re going to have a very strong first quarter as we mentioned kind of 4 to 5 revpar we are and expect the third quarter to be strong while second quarter you ve got tough comps there due to such strong improvements there last year we feel comfortable with it rich there are things that can happen in geopolitical but when you think about the group base that we have obviously the layering in the contract business also continues to be strong and we are cautiously optimistic and are very comfortable with the guidance that we provided rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay so the low end of the range then just to kind of characterize that is more of a macro cushion it sounds like kind of up against all the other positive indicators you mentioned thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s a very fair statement but remember we re up 10 plus or minus here on below that 30 of our business so we feel we ve got a solid anchoring there that low line for sure rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay got it and then my second question here as you ve seen the company is trading multiple rerate progressively since the company was spun out from hilton a couple of years back are you noticing more acquisition opportunities i m sorry past the initial screen as you think about external growth this year thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes for sure rich i mean listen this is all part of a master plan for us if you think about the way we thought very carefully about our plan in the first two years and again the internal growth story we were anchored and obviously recycling capital we sold 14 assets for 570 million obviously we used 348 million of that to buy back 14 million shares as part of the hna trade if you look at the stock performance since the hna trade including dividends we ve got to be up north of 40 outperformed our peers 1 400 basis points both look in 2018 if you look two years it will be greater than that i m very proud of the work that we ve done made great progress on obviously the roi projects that we ve talked about regarding the fess parker double tree to a hilton the bonnet creek work that s going to begin we obviously are going to be converting the reach this year and starting the urgent process on double tree san jose converting that to a hilton and we ve made great progress on a number of initiatives on the margin front as we demonstrated there were a fair number of naysayers out there and we said we d grow margin 75 basis points in 2018 where and we delivered certainly 60 basis points on an absolute side and continue to close that gap and that grouping up which as we just talked about from maybe it s a question we continue to make great progress there so all of that provides us with the optionality as we reshape the portfolio to begin to going off it and we re going to be very thoughtful about it and disciplined about it we ll continue to look whether that s single assets whether that s portfolios or whether that s other transactions we re clearly not going to be selling stock where we re trading we re not going to issue stock at i would say at a discount to nav i think you know me you know the discipline that i bring to the process and the team certainly shares that i think we ve demonstrated that we re very prudent capital allocators so we re excited about the growth prospects and candidly it s important for us to also show both that brand in offering diversification so we d love to be able to fold in on marriott brand in our hyatt brand and impress other brands at the appropriate time and at the appropriate pricing so we love our positioning and we love the great opportunity that we have as we move forward rich hightower evercore isi analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of smedes rose from citi please proceed with your question smedes rose citi analyst hi thanks i just wanted to make sure in your guidance for margin growth in 2019 does that include the 20 basis points lift from the exclusion of the chicago o hare airport hotel sean m dell orto executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi smedes it s sean it is not it s obviously a comparable set year over year so o hare would not be another year looking at smedes rose citi analyst okay and then i wanted to just talk a little bit more about the group the pace is so strong compared to peers for 2019 i m just wondering is there any way you could maybe talk about it with san francisco and then for the rest of the portfolio and normally wouldn t break that out but it seems like san francisco is so strong this year and next year that it would be helpful to kind of know how much of that is driving the growth thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes specifically smedes to make sure i understand your question getting a sense of group pace in terms of our other key markets is that your question smedes rose citi analyst yes thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so again as we mentioned hawaii up 23 san francisco up 17 2 chicago up nearly 8 new york again up 6 4 keep in mind both chicago and new york as we said in the prepared remarks is sitting down both well north of 30 so again in that soft market we were proactive rerouting funds and again we were grouping up so again showing the proactive teamwork leadership focus from men and women in part coupled with our operating partners at hilton so we ve got a long lead time here so we were looking at this two and three years ago it wasn t just six months ago in this process so really proud of the discipline and how hard the team has worked here hence the reason that we re getting the results and we continue to outperform our peers on the on these matters and with that again new orleans up 3 new orleans is also down about 20 this year we re up in 3 orlando was down 5 citywide we re up about 2 2 d c is down and we are also down we are not down as far as many of our peers are vis a vis there so again a concerted effort proactive into group up and we played though the internal growth strategies that we have been talking about non stop for the last two years we re bearing the fruit of that hard work smedes rose citi analyst okay yeah thanks for the color operator our next question comes from the line of david katz from jefferies please proceed with your question thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hi david david katz jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone i just wanted to go back to the opportunity for acquisitions in that landscape has pricing gotten stiffer what kind of term landscape are you seeing and what would you say are kind of the two biggest obstacles for getting something done this year is it finding the right thing is it finding the right price how should we think about that thank you thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s a great question david look we re open for business clearly the first two years and the safe harbor and some of the other tax issues that we had to be really sensitive to but even more important than that we thought obviously as a new public company we had to earn our stripes we need to make sure that we have the operational discipline and then through all those initiatives that i have outlined really i think are on much better footing we ve actually got a much stronger multiple today than we had certainly two years ago and that certainly gives us optionality we will continue to look opportunistically for single asset deals that meet our criteria and brand and operating diversification are a big part of that we ll continue to look at portfolios that make sense and we re not opposed to m a we have said that and one of the big attractions to this opportunity for me the park is we think that this industry and our sector is really right for consolidation and at the appropriate time we certainly want to be a participant in that process what we re not interested in we note there are some other large portfolios that are out there and their pricing and forecasts and sub forecasts we re not a buyer of that kind of real estate in this pricing cycle we don t think it s prudent we don t think that s disciplined we certainly aren t looking to lever up we certainly want to stay north of five times net debt to ebitda and as we ve said we were well south of four times today so we do have the flexibility whether it s single asset or a small portfolio or m a in the right situation could make sense we re not planning to issue equity unless we see the stock trading at or above any day it s certainly something that we will be more open to david katz jefferies analyst can we just go back to the size issue for one second if that s all right it is are there circumstances where something that s in the 5 billion 6 billion category a possibility for you thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah yeah again you re asking a hypothetical it s structured in an appropriate way and it makes economic sense and it s a premium yeah it s hard to imagine a 5 billion deal talking about a potential large portfolio that we all know is being marketed i don t see that being fit for us there s certainly could be other stock or stock deals that could make sense and be of scale david katz jefferies analyst got it i just wanted to understand the boundaries thanks for your answers thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of anthony powell from barclays please proceed with your question anthony powell barclays analyst hi hello everyone thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning anthony how are you anthony powell barclays analyst good good there seem to be differences of demand growth in the corporate transient and corporate group segments with group doing well to your benefit have you diverged in price cycles and how long did it last do you think thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question i think look if you think about the economic climate obviously we re getting late in the national business cycle getting 10 years lodging plus or minus we think historically trough to trough is about 11 years trough to peak it s about seven years look we ve had anemic growth early in the cycle and they re still running them they re still laying i know there s some who believe that a recession is likely in 2020 we certainly don t share that view and you look at the economic data i think which came out today obviously our gnp about 2 6 i think non residential fixed investment spending is up about 6 2 in the fourth quarter and still expected to be up 4 so that clearly continues to provide a backdrop what we re also finding is that it s the companies with low employment is they are looking to continue to train by the appropriate incentives to continue to motivate their workforces that we are still seeing that corporations are still spending money on their group needs and again given our natural competitive footprint plus from geographic standpoint and from an access standpoint i think park is really positioned to take advantage of that these transient has been choppy and we re excited as we look back to 2018 and for us relatively flat slightly up in total but our group business was up 5 our contract business again has grown 21 so we think that s just appropriate we re playing to our strength and using the appropriate levers but as the cycle continues to lengthen they are it will be pockets that weren t choppy but we really like our positioning certainly in 2019 and on in 2020 anthony powell barclays analyst thanks and moving on to acquisitions looking at the peer group most of the deal actually is focused on smaller hotels resorts and increasingly independent hotels what s your type i mean type of hotels in your portfolio i know you ve preferred brand historically but could you see adding some large independent or boutique hotels for the future thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no secret anthony i am a strong believer in brands have made that and obviously having worked for the marriott companies and having worked for hilton i ve got a strong understanding i would say that they ve got a long term competitive advantage given the brand segmentation given their loyalty program i think hilton has got now 85 million members in their loyalty program plus or minus and i know marriott is somewhere in the 120 million range and more than 50 if not 60 of their occupancy coming through those are powerful of historical systems so i m a brand guy and we believe here at park in the strength of brands so and we embrace the soft brands which is another lay out i see the timing in those portals in a very distinctive way so we as you think about our strategy it s really upper upscale and luxury hotels top 25 markets in dream destinations we really have a bias toward those bigger group houses for all the reasons that we ve been talking about on the phone we re not opposed to an independent opportunities and probably look to partner or have those tied into one of our preferred brands and certainly have marriott and hilton on the top of that list but we look forward to expanding our relationship with higher and leverage as well anthony powell barclays analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chris woronka from deutsche bank please proceed with your question chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning chris chris woronka deutsche bank analyst good morning i want to ask on the margins how did 2018 unfold relative to your expectations on kind of a core inflation on the core expenses you guys obviously beat your guidance so i m trying to figure out how much of that was due to expense pressures not being as bad and how much of it was due to maybe your initiatives thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer rob is going to take that question for you robert d tanenbaum executive vice president asset management chris overall in 2018 our operating expenses were up 2 5 and really it was a combination of controlling our expenses throughout we spent a great deal of time driving revenues and looking at our premium room category we ve had great success throughout our portfolio to give you a quick example in san francisco 85 rooms we categorized from standard rooms to a new room category and have generated over 700 000 of revenue alone have similar success in boston logan converted 148 rooms to a new category and we re actually looking at other hotels as well including embassy suites in austin to be forthcoming so the other part that we are looking at here is our pricing not only in between categories but also within the categories as we see how do we further drive revenues to help further reduce our cost control there and our pricing within the various booking windows when we look at pricing going on 30 days 60 days 90 days we really believe there s opportunity to further drive our rent there and then from the cost side we ve been renegotiating our contracts throughout great opportunity our team in honolulu are doing an amazing job with a elevator contract saving over 1 5 million over the life of the contract over four years so really working with our teams we think differently as we look forward there we re also combining our management position reducing our food costs and also taking operations in house a great example of that is that in key west we took our beach and pool operation in house we saw an increase in our guest service satisfaction but more importantly and additionally excuse me we had the availability of having a run rate of 200 000 coming down to ebitda so we re really thinking throughout our process here how do we work together to further drive our revenues and the bottom line chris woronka deutsche bank analyst great that s great color rob thanks just i ll try to sneak in one more acquisition question if i can and it s really how do you how important is it to you guys that if we re talking a single asset that you have kind of a story to the hotel and i guess the real question is are you willing to do transformative things at this point in the cycle or do you think you re looking more for yield that s already there thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i that s a fair question chris i would say that an asset was in place the cash flow forming an embedded story whether that s through the asset management initiative some of which rob just outlined whether it s a property needing capital infusion so you are doing something transformative taking a deep turn at this point in the cycle is not something we re likely to do it s something that you take on sort of earlier in the cycle or later in the cycle those also tend to be better plays for many private equity platforms in sort of what i would call traditional reit food so you will see us continue to be as we demonstrated i ll remind listeners that discipline and the track record and how prudent we ve been on capital allocation we re going to be very thoughtful we re going to be disciplined remain compliant with our guiding principles operational excellence capital allocation a low levered balance sheet and never going to deviate from that discipline and that discipline as we demonstrated has delivered outperformance significant outperformance vis a vis our peers chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay very good thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of gregory miller from suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i m on the line for patrick scholes good morning first question have a related question on your margin plan could you provide some color as to how much further you still have to go on margins to get to a relatively stabilized level similar to your peers thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer listen i that s an ongoing i mean keep in mind we continue to reshape the portfolio right so when you think about it we ve got now 52 hotels really the top 25 hotels and they account for about 90 of the value you can expect that we re going to continue to sell non core assets and recycle that capital either in the higher growth markets or alternatively into buying back stock if it made sense and when it s opportunistic for us so a credit and rob didn t breakout or walk you through our half dozen initiatives we need to say on behalf of rob and the great marketer we re doing in our asset management team we ve probably got 20 initiatives and we continue to work that depending on the hotel situation and we continue to have success but that disciplined focus and making sure that we re taking advantage of it there is a gap and closed it we believe about 110 basis points vis a vis our peers and that s still probably just south of 300 basis points obviously given our portfolio 60 of them being our cost structure is different we think that s really embedded into the dna of our culture continuing to seek ways to improvise as we said another 100 basis points this year cost structure s obviously rising but we re confident that we can that we re positive margin growth at least 30 basis points certainly given that backdrop patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst great thanks for that and on another topic could you remind us about your demand for the u k and thoughts about potential impact from brexit especially to the gateway market that you re in and particularly the potential impact to transient demand thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer now when you think about it the dollar is down about 10 vis a vis the euro if anything you can take out hawaii we see we saw a slight increase in international demand and so from that standpoint we re encouraged obviously hawaii is so dependent on what s happening project s coming out of asia so a little bit of a wholesale concerning the reduction last year and we expect that s going to rebound this year so we re cautiously optimistic and we don t see any real fall off at this point as we look out and what we saw in 2018 look out we saw growth in chicago we saw the growth in new york so we are cautiously optimistic as we move forward patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right great thanks appreciate it tom operator our next question comes from the line of stephen grambling from goldman sachs please proceed with your question stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst good morning thanks i guess my follow up on the thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst good morning the brand diversification topic i guess how do you quantify the benefits from diversifying away from hilton while balancing the unique benefits from your relationship that have helped support the playbook since the split thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so it s a great question i would just say that if you look at long term having a diversified platform and by diversified i mean that in terms of brand family in terms of operator terribly important and for us long term when you think about sort of the evolution of all those to where they are that brand diversification i think is very important also being able to look at different best practices that you re seeing from the brands and you re also seeing from other operators so we look forward to that now we do have a unique relationship today we are partnering on a daily basis we ve got a dedicated team within hilton that we re working with and clearly that s bearing significant fruit to us but long term our vision is to be the preeminent lodging reit to able to do that we clearly want to have a diversified platform for the brand operator and look forward to getting our first deal done with marriott with hyatt and with others over time stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst so would anything change then with the relationship with hilton thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer nothing will change in my past life stephen we had that was a large hilton area and hyatt franchisee and we had 16 17 management companies i don t see us getting to that level of management companies it makes the closing process a little more difficult it makes the asset management a little more challenging but i would tell you that the men and women in park are really looking forward to that and excited about really continuing to strengthen this relationships beyond hilton i love our partnerships with hilton and obviously as we ve continued to demonstrate it is going very very well stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst that s helpful color and maybe one other quick follow up on consolidation it seems that bigger consolidation across the space tends to come under a life event for management teams or differing view by one management team versus another on either the cycle or the willingness to navigate the next leg of the cycle do you feel like there has been a change in either of these factors across the space that may be creating opportunities there thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes well listen i ve been talking about it for probably north of a decade now as many of the listeners know and still a passionate believer i think it s inevitable we are the most fragmented in a sector that is right for consolidation it will happen at the appropriate time we saw last year with couple working with lasalle we saw it the year before with rlj and bell corp and i think others will begin to look for dance partners at the appropriate time social issues tend to be the biggest impediment at the end of the day capital is going to be the most efficient manager it s just not efficient to have 16 or 17 whatever the number of lodging reits that we have today and over time that value is its going to change in my view stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst helpful thanks best of luck this year thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of brandt montour from jpmorgan please proceed with your question brandt montour jpmorgan analyst hey good morning everyone thanks for taking for question so you talked about the group a lot and you ve been proactive over the last two to three years giving professional tours going out and getting that group business i was just wondering are you seeing the market getting more competitive maybe running into some of your peers out there putting more resources in this business and really going out and getting that in house group business thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it s a great question i would say every situation is different in our portfolio we saw immediately it s a competitive advantage and there was a gap there so we set out on that journey it takes time to do that so obviously perhaps all of the day it will take them some time to catch up in our view obviously lyman ph and inaudible leading his very talented team are being in the right i think they are are front of this that s really the nature of the business but we re not seeing them any more today than normally i think we suspect that both hilton area and hyatt and other really big platforms that are managing that better in normal business case certainly fighting for share on that side of the business but that business is so large there s enough growth and capacity for all of us here brandt montour jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and then to extend that same topic if you extent that the convention calendar they reverse in 2020 how aggressively are you booking up 2020 group room occupancies or at least what s the philosophy on booking that far out and potentially forgoing like compression like pricing later on thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah again as i said earlier it s really a fundamental challenge for us if you think about 2020 as an example of yet another year where citywides are going do not as certainly not as strong as what we ve seen in other periods so there s hawaii and we re up 34 new york we re up 31 san francisco we re up 7 9 and i think in the bonnet creek our resort there in orlando up another 5 5 so again for us it is the thesis is anchor our business with the group they are in some contract businesses and which allow us to most efficiently price transient grow the ancillary revenue think about san francisco we ve got a full city block we ve got 3 000 rooms so having that anchored group business for us is a really prudent move coupled with having a certain amount of transient of contract business think about obviously our hilton hawaiian village campus there we ve got 2 900 rooms so again just for us it s just a prudent business decision to continue to grow business appropriately and then layer in that transient brandt montour jpmorgan analyst great helpful thanks good luck on great results thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of robin farley from ubs please proceed with your question thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey robin robin farley ubs analyst great thank you hi how are you you commented the group up 10 for 2019 and i think last quarter you had talked about being up 12 so i m just wondering if bookings slowed in the fourth quarter or if there was just something about the timing of that up 12 in q3 that compared to the 10 now thanks thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer nothing that visible robyn we ve continued strong anchored again of 10 we feel good very good about our positioning part of that s just the year over year evolving and again just look out to 2020 as we mentioned we re up north of 9 so noting no deceleration we re not seeing cancellations increase they re very good and we ve got 80 of our business on the books for this year so feel very good about our position for 2019 robin farley ubs analyst okay great i don t know if you d give like bookings that came in q4 versus the prior year for group and then just my other follow up i also wanted to ask on you mentioned leisure down 0 4 and i m just wondering is that because group took up inventory that would have gone to that or is there something else going on there with leisure in your view thanks thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i don t the reality is that i think that the transient has been choppy leisure really has been stronger if you think about this cycling and business in transient has somewhat lagged so a little bit of a reverse effect right we were up business in transient about 4 2 in the fourth quarter and it s really down again i don t there s nothing as we look out and see the transient pace the transient pace continues to be strong across most of the segments so we ve been having a diversified portfolio we re comfortable with the guidance and the direction of the business in 2019 robin farley ubs analyst okay great thank you operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks thomas jeremiah baltimore chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well it s great to be with all of you today

challenges in terms of trade negotiations and tariffs the signing of the usmca and its ratification in some form is positive for our industry and we believe for suppliers such as us the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs placed by the u s and canada is not helpful to the industry but we believe the tariffs will be removed sometime this year what was very special for us in the year was the progress we made in developing our culture our new vision making lives better by being the best we can be in the products we make and the services we provide has been embraced by our people as witnessed in day to day activity and employee feedback our culture of lean thinking entrepreneurialism and treating people the way they want to be treated is we believe helping to drive our financial performance and making us a go to employer and supplier on this basis we expect 2019 to be a record year for us in terms of financial performance with adjusted operating income margins above 8 and we anticipate continued operating income margin improvement to above 9 in 2020 and revenues next year to exceed 4 billion results of operations all amounts in this press release are in canadian dollars

only did we have a record year in terms of financial performance but we did so in an automotive environment that was fairly flat in terms of production in our key markets while experiencing some real challenges in terms of trade negotiations and tariffs the signing of the usmca and its ratification in some form is positive for our industry and we believe for suppliers such as us the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs placed by the u s and canada is not helpful to the industry but we believe the tariffs will be removed sometime this year what was very special for us in the year was the progress we made in developing our culture our new vision making lives better by being the best we can be in the products we make and the services we provide has been embraced by our people as witnessed in day to day activity and employee feedback our culture of lean thinking entrepreneurialism and treating people the way they want to be treated is we believe helping to drive our financial performance and making us a go to employer and supplier on this basis we expect 2019 to be a record year for us in terms of financial performance with adjusted operating income margins above 8 and we anticipate continued operating income margin improvement to above 9 in 2020 and revenues next year to exceed 4 billion results of operations all amounts in this press release are in canadian dollars

our fourth quarter results however over an extended period of time currency fluctuations may increasingly impact our results we also hedge certain expenses we hedge our net cash flow exposures using a four quarter rolling layered hedge program as such a portion of the projected euro yen british pound and australian dollar denominated billings for the remainder of fiscal 2020 have been hedged the

licenses subscription plan arr captures arr relating to subscription offerings refer to the definition of recurring revenue below for more details on what is included within arr recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation arr is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business arr should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items annualized revenue per subscription arps is calculated by dividing our annualized recurring revenue by the total number of subscriptions billings total revenue plus net change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period cloud service offerings represents individual term based offerings deployed through web browser technologies or in a hybrid software and cloud configuration cloud service offerings that are bundled with other product offerings are not captured as a separate cloud service offering constant currency cc growth rates we attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses

gains or losses from foreign currency hedge contracts that are reported in the current and comparative periods core business represents the combination of maintenance product and eba enterprise

tsx atp atlantic power or the company today reported its financial results for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 net income in 2018 compared favorably with a net loss in 2017 primarily because the company recorded 187 1 million of impairment expense in 2017 but none in 2018 cash from operating activities and project adjusted ebitda declined in 2018 primarily because of power purchase agreement ppa expirations in late 2017 and early 2018 and the non recurrence of oefc settlement revenue recorded in 2017 as expected impairment expense is not included in project adjusted ebitda or cash flow project adjusted ebitda of 185 1 million was at the high end of our 2018 guidance range and operating cash flow of 137 5 million modestly exceeded our expectations said james j moore jr president and ceo of atlantic power we used the majority of that cash flow to repay 100 million of debt further strengthening our balance sheet and reducing our interest costs during the year we executed two re pricings of our term loan for additional cost savings we also invested more than 24 million in common and preferred share repurchases in 2018 at attractive price to value levels and announced two acquisitions representing our first external growth investments after three years of intense focus on our costs and balance sheet mr moore continued in 2019 we expect to repay another 86 million of debt continuing the ongoing reduction in our debt levels and leverage ratio in addition we have liquidity of 191 million including approximately 39 million of discretionary cash that we will allocate to growth investments and common and preferred share repurchases when these are accretive to intrinsic value per share atlantic power corporation table 1 summary of financial results in

ebitda is not a recognized measure under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap therefore this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies please refer to non gaap disclosures on page 15 of this news release for an explanation and a reconciliation of project adjusted ebitda as used in this news release to project income loss the most directly comparable measure on a gaap basis and net income loss financial results for the three months ended december 31 2018 key drivers the most significant drivers of fourth quarter results were the expirations of the ppas at kapuskasing and north bay in ontario at year end 2017 the early terminations of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 the short term contract extension at williams lake less favorable economics effective april 2 2018 and higher maintenance expense at oxnard due to gas turbine repairs the impact of ppa expirations was expected on the positive side curtis palmer benefited from stronger water flows and tunis returned to service under a new ppa in october 2018 net income loss project income loss and project adjusted ebitda net income attributable to atlantic power corporation for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 24 7 million compared to a net loss of 41 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 65 8 million swing from loss to income was primarily attributable to 72 2 million of impairment expense recorded in 2017 that did not recur 10 4 million lower project interest expense due to the repayment of piedmont project debt in october 2017 the 2017 period included a 9 4 million swap termination cost and a 12 3 million increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar depreciated during the quarter these positive factors were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues a 9 2 million unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments and a 12 2 million reduction in income tax benefit project income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 20 1 million as compared to a project loss of 39 7 million in the year ago period the most significant drivers of the 59 8 million improvement were the non recurrence of impairment expense recorded at curtis palmer williams lake and frederickson in the 2017 period and lower project interest expense due primarily to the repayment of piedmont project debt in full in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the non recurrence of a related swap termination cost these positive factors were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues and an unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments project adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2018 declined to 46 6 million from 62 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 15 5 million decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of contracts at kapuskasing and north bay at year end 2017 17 1 million the early termination of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 2 3 million a less favorable short term ppa at williams lake 1 6 million and gas turbine repairs at oxnard 1 2 million these decreases were partially offset by higher water flows at curtis palmer 3 6 million and the return of tunis to commercial operation under the new ppa and the absence of start up expenses incurred in 2017 1 8 million cash flow cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased to 39 7 million from 30 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 results were positively affected by a 16 8 million reduction in cash interest payments due primarily to the piedmont swap termination expense in the 2017 period the timing of payments on the new series e convertible debentures one in july 2018 and two annually going forward in january and july the reduction in debt levels and the reduced spread on the company s credit facilities distributions from unconsolidated affiliates increased 7 9 million but this was partly a timing issue as the september distribution from orlando was not received until october 1 3 6 million chambers had an increase of 4 2 million due to lower operation and maintenance expenditures and a release of working capital these factors which positively affected cash flow were partially offset by lower project adjusted ebitda for the quarter as previously discussed cash used in investing activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 1 million compared to a 1 4 million source of funds in the fourth quarter of 2017 cash used in financing activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 27 1 million as compared to 82 1 million in the year ago period the company repaid 20 8 million of term loan and project debt repurchased 4 3 million of common shares and paid 2 0 million of preferred dividends in the comparable 2017 period the company repaid 79 6 million of term loan and project debt including piedmont in full and paid 2 2 million of preferred dividends during the fourth quarter the company had a 12 5 million net increase in cash restricted cash and cash equivalents financial results for the year ended december 31 2018 key drivers the most significant drivers of full year results were the expirations early terminations and short term extensions of the ppas at kapuskasing and north bay the san diego projects and williams lake and as previously described maintenance costs associated with the tunis re start in the first six months of 2018 and the manchief gas turbine overhaul in the second quarter of 2018 and lower water flows at curtis palmer than in 2017 though they were very close to average these declines were partially offset by increases at morris mamquam frederickson orlando and nipigon net income loss project income loss and project adjusted ebitda net income attributable to atlantic power corporation for 2018 was 36 8 million compared to a net loss of 98 6 million in 2017 the 135 4 million improvement was primarily attributable to a 135 6 million increase in project income discussed below a 39 1 million increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain 22 8 million gain versus a 16 3 million loss which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars due to the depreciation of the canadian dollar during the year compared to an appreciation in 2017 and to higher canadian debt instruments due to the issuance of the series e convertible debenture in january 2018 an 11 5 million reduction in corporate interest expense as a result of debt repayment and re pricing of the company s credit facilities and a 3 2 million unrealized gain on the fair value of the conversion option of the series e debentures these positive factors were partially offset by a 58 3 million reduction in income tax benefit project income for 2018 increased to 88 2 million from a project loss of 47 4 million in 2017 the 135 6 million improvement was primarily attributable to the non recurrence of 187 1 million of impairment expense recorded in 2017 a 15 7 million reduction in interest expense due to lower debt balances and the reduced spread on the company s credit facilities in addition the company recorded a purchase accounting gain of 7 2 million on the acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in koma kulshan also morris orlando and other projects had increases in project income these positive variances were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues and maintenance expense associated with the tunis re start and the manchief gas turbine overhaul project adjusted ebitda for 2018 declined to 185 1 million from 288 8 million in 2017 the 103 7 million decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of contracts at kapuskasing and north bay at year end 2017 71 3 million the early termination of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 24 0 million maintenance expenses incurred at tunis in preparation for re start incurred in 2018 and the non recurrence of oefc settlement revenues recorded in 2017 9 0 million a less favorable short term ppa at williams lake partially offset by cost reductions 8 4 million maintenance expenses associated with the manchief gas turbine overhaul in the second quarter of 2018 5 5 million and lower water flows at curtis palmer 2 8 million partially offsetting these decreases were increases at morris 7 4 million due to a higher capacity price realized in the pjm capacity auction for this year higher steam and ancillary services revenues higher merchant dispatch and lower expenses mamquam 3 3 million due to higher water flows and lower maintenance expense frederickson 3 0 million due to maintenance expense in 2017 and orlando 2 9 million due to higher availability and higher contractual capacity rates cash flow cash provided by operating activities declined 31 7 million to 137 5 million in 2018 from 169 2 million in 2017 results were negatively affected by the 103 7 million reduction in project adjusted ebitda however this impact was partially offset by 39 3 million of net favorable changes in working capital particularly a 20 6 million decrease in working

not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda the company has initiated guidance for 2019 project adjusted ebitda in the range of 175 million to 190 million the midpoint of this guidance range is in line with the 2018 actual result of 185 1 million the most significant factor negatively affecting 2019 results is the short term contract extension at williams lake which became

per ag eq oz mine operating earnings before non cash items cost of sales before non cash items and adjusted ebitda throughout this document the computation of cash cost per ag eq oz reflects actual realized prices for the by products 3 average realized silver and gold prices are prior to smelting and refining charges review of full year 2018 financial results during the year ended december 31 2018 the company earned revenues of 59 4 million compared to 63 7 million in 2017 the decrease in revenue relative to the prior year was primarily attributable to a decrease in realized metal prices for all metals 4 0 million effect and a decrease in metal sales volumes 2 3 million effect these were partly offset by lower smelting and refining charges which are netted against revenue due to more favourable revenue contract terms with customers for 2018 2 0 million effect production costs for the year ended december 31 2018 were 47 4 million an increase of 14 over the same period in 2017 this was predominantly attributable to higher mxn denominated unit mining costs as a result of mining narrower veins at the gmc which requires more waste material to be mined along with minor rate increases for mining contractors together a 7 8 million effect this was mainly the case in the third quarter and the early part of the fourth quarter of 2018 when the company undertook previously announced restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and began to realize unit cost reductions in the fourth quarter of 2018 relative to the third quarter of 2018 these factors were partly offset by the decrease in sales volumes primarily from silver and gold together a 1 4 million effect and the weakening of the mxn relative to the usd which reduced production costs in usd terms as these are predominantly incurred in mxn 0 7 million effect mine operating earnings before non cash items decreased by 10 0 million as revenue decreased by 4 3 million due to a decline in realized metal prices as compared to 2017 and production costs increased by 5 7 million due to increased waste to ore ratios amortization and depletion decreased mainly due to the increase in the estimated useful life of gmc based on the mineral resource estimate update announced earlier in the year partly offset by the decrease in useful life of topia based on the accelerated production rate anticipated in 2019 and future years general and administrative g a expenses decreased 18 compared to the same period in 2017 due to non recurring expenses incurred in the comparative period related to strategic changes and initiatives to position the company for future growth and development these included expenses related to ceo succession other management changes and implementation of long term incentive programs exploration evaluation and development expenses ee d increased 3 5 million or 37 compared to the same period in 2017 as coricancha was acquired on june 30 2017 there were only care and maintenance expenditures for half a year of 2 9 million in 2017 compared to a full year s expenditures of 7 1 million in 2018 comprising care and maintenance expenditures and costs associated with the bulk sample program the company will continue to expense project costs and ongoing care and maintenance associated with coricancha until such time a formal decision is made to restart the mine ee d expenditures for the year ended december 31 2018 also reflected 1 1 million of higher corporate development costs for the evaluation and negotiation of acquisition opportunities mainly related to the agreement to acquire beadell these factors were partly offset by a 1 4 million decrease in exploration expenses at topia and san ignacio a 0 2 million decrease in changes in reclamation estimates recorded in ee d and a 0 1 million decrease in exploration expenses at santa rosa the cost of undertaking the closure plan and any approved amendments for the coricancha legacy tailings are subject to an agreement with the prior owner of coricancha to reimburse the company for these costs refer to the company s press release dated july 3 2017 for further details of this agreement the company has previously received full reimbursement of costs incurred furthermore all permits are in place to restart coricancha and the status of a decision from the ministry of energy and mines to modify the closure plan does not affect the permitting of the mine finance and other income expense primarily includes interest income or expense and foreign exchange gains and losses these were 1 8 million compared to 2 4 million in the same period in 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018 the company recorded a foreign exchange gain of 1 1 million mainly due to the positive mark to market adjustment on the company s foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as at december 31 2018 and realized gains on the settlement of forward contracts during the year this is compared to a foreign exchange gain of 2 3 million in the same period in 2017 which was also due to the realized gains on the settlement of forward contracts the decrease was partly offset by a 0 7 million increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates and higher cash balances income tax expense decreased by 0 8 million compared to the same period in 2017 which was predominantly attributable to lower mexican special mining duties partly offset by higher mexican withholding tax liabilities the increase in net loss was primarily due to a 9 5 million decrease in mine operating earnings a 3 5 million increase in ee d expenses and a 0 6 million net decrease in finance and other income these factors were partly offset by a 1 4 million decrease in g a expenses and a 0 8 million decrease in income tax expense the decrease in adjusted ebitda largely reflects a 10 0 million decrease in mine operating earnings before non cash items a 3 8 million increase in ee d expenses before non cash items such as share based compensation and changes in estimate of reclamation provisions and a 0 1 million decrease in other income these factors were partly offset by a 1 5 million decrease in g a expenses before non cash items refer to the company s md a for the year ended december 31 2018 for more details of the 2018 financial results including a discussion of the results for the three months ended december 31 2018 cash cost and all in sustaining costs the lower production of silver and gold from gmc resulted from physical variability of the resource and grades therein in addition the mining of narrower than planned vein widths increased mining costs per tonne of ore mined production also declined from restructuring initiatives taken to reduce mining from the guanajuato mine in order to lower costs and mitigate the impact of lower metal prices cash cost per silver payable ounce cash cost for the year ended december 31 2018 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in mxn denominated production costs at gmc for the factors noted above 3 50 per oz effect lower payable silver ounces 0 39 per oz effect as well as a decrease in by product credits associated with lower gold sales and lower realized average prices for gold lead and zinc 0 76 per oz effect these factors were partly offset by lower smelting and refining charges 1 10 per oz effect and weakening of the mxn to the usd which had the effect of decreasing production costs in usd terms by 0 38 per oz aisc for the year ended december 31 2018 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the increase in cash cost discussed above 3 17 per oz effect as well as a decrease in payable silver ounces which had the effect of further increasing aisc by 0 64 per oz these were partly offset by lower sustaining ee d expenses and capital expenditures together a 2 38 per oz effect and lower general and administrative g a expenses 0 87 per oz effect refer to the company s md a for the year ended december 31 2018 for further discussion of cash cost and aisc and for a reconciliation to the company s financial results as reported under ifrs cash short term deposits and working capital at december 31 2018 at december 31 2018 the company had cash and short term deposits of 50 6 million compared to 56 9 million at december 31 2017 and no long term debt cash and short term deposits decreased by 6 3 million during 2018 primarily due to a 5 0 million loan advanced to beadell in connection with the acquisition of the company and 2 1 million in additions to mineral property plant and equipment these factors were partly offset by 0 3 million of cash generated by operating activities 0 3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and 0 1 million foreign exchange adjustment on cash balances net working capital was 61 9 million as at december 31 2018 a decrease of 4 1 million from december 31 2017 the decrease was predominantly due to cash flow used in operating activities before changes in non cash working capital of 6 7 million and additions to mineral property plant and equipment of 2 1 million these factors were partly offset by the reclassification of 1 9 million of coricancha reimbursement rights on the legacy tailings reclamation work from long term to current based on the estimated timing and amount of reclamation expenditures at year end a 1 2 million peruvian value added tax refund foreign exchange gains of 1 1 million 0 3 million of stock option proceeds and 0 2 million of other income outlook great panther expects to close the acquisition of beadell in early march on january 29 2019 beadell issued 2019 production guidance of 145 000 to 155 000 gold ounces at an all in sustaining cost of 1 000 to 1 100 per ounce the company will review beadell s guidance and expects to provide an update with the company s reporting for the first quarter of 2019 the company s focus for beadell in 2019 will be integration realization of cost synergies by rationalizing

already been a significant degree of coordination and integration with great panther s head office through regularly scheduled meetings regular communication site visits and sharing of information and data great panther also plans to immediately work with beadell s existing exploration team to develop a program aimed at capitalizing on tucano s significant exploration potential great panther will continue to evaluate its head office resources and needed skills and competencies to facilitate the integration of tucano and ongoing oversight and management in this regard the company has recently added senior technical and senior administrative positions both of which have been filled by brazilian canadians who have professional qualifications and experience in the mining sector in brazil the company will also continue to assess its needs at the executive level as previously announced the company took steps in the second half of 2018 to realign operations at gmc to reduce unit costs and maximize mine operating cash flow with a modest reduction in production the company has undertaken a multi mine optimization strategy under which the entire production for gmc during 2019 will be sourced from the lower cost san ignacio mine enabling a focused exploration program for the guanajuato mine aimed at growing higher margin resources in addition a planned increase in the processing capacity from the topia mine in 2019 is expected to increase topia s production by approximately 25 compared to 2018 for 2019 the company expects production to be in the range of 3 7 to 4 0 million ag

should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves the estimates of net present values for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of net present values for all properties due to the effects of aggregation proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional

conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22 3 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 31 1 degrees api gravity and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 22 3 degrees api gravity with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for that year this press release contains several oil and gas metrics including f d costs fd a costs and rli these oil and gas metrics have been prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the company s operations over time readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this news release should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes a summary of the calculations of such metrics are as follows finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing capital expenditures by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category f d costs including fdc include all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition fd a costs represent the costs of property acquisition exploration and development incurred the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fd a costs are calculated as capital expenditures plus net acquisition costs plus change in fdc fd a per boe is calculated as fd a costs divided by reserves additions

because the company recorded 187 1 million of impairment expense in 2017 but none in 2018 cash from operating activities and project adjusted ebitda declined in 2018 primarily because of power purchase agreement ppa expirations in late 2017 and early 2018 and the non recurrence of oefc settlement revenue recorded in 2017 as expected impairment expense is not included in project adjusted ebitda or cash flow project adjusted ebitda of 185 1 million was at the high end of our 2018 guidance range and operating cash flow of 137 5 million modestly exceeded our expectations said james j

as used in this news release to project income loss the most directly comparable measure on a gaap basis and net income loss financial results for the three months ended december 31 2018 key drivers the most significant drivers of fourth quarter results were the expirations of the ppas at kapuskasing and north bay in ontario at year end 2017 the early terminations of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 the short term contract extension at williams lake less favorable economics effective april 2 2018 and higher maintenance expense at oxnard due to gas turbine repairs the impact of ppa expirations was expected on the positive side curtis palmer benefited from stronger water flows and tunis returned to service under a new ppa in october 2018 net income loss project income loss and project adjusted ebitda net income attributable to atlantic power corporation for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 24 7 million compared to a net loss of 41 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 65 8 million swing from loss to income was primarily attributable to 72 2 million of impairment expense recorded in 2017 that did not recur 10 4 million lower project interest expense due to the repayment of piedmont project debt in october 2017 the 2017 period included a 9 4 million swap termination cost and a 12 3 million increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar depreciated during the quarter these positive factors were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues a 9 2 million unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments and a 12 2 million reduction in income tax benefit project income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 20 1 million as compared to a project loss of 39 7 million in the year ago period the most significant drivers of the 59 8 million improvement were the non recurrence of impairment expense recorded at curtis palmer williams lake and frederickson in the 2017 period and lower project interest expense due primarily to the repayment of piedmont project debt in full in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the non recurrence of a related swap termination cost these positive factors were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues and an unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments project adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2018 declined to 46 6 million from 62 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 15 5 million decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of contracts at kapuskasing and north bay at year end 2017 17 1 million the early termination of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 2 3 million a less favorable short term ppa at williams lake 1 6 million and gas turbine repairs at oxnard 1 2 million these decreases were partially offset by higher water flows at curtis palmer 3 6 million and the return of tunis to commercial operation under the new ppa and the absence of start up expenses incurred in 2017 1 8 million cash flow cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased to 39 7 million from 30 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 results were positively affected by a 16 8 million reduction in cash interest payments due primarily to the piedmont swap termination expense in the 2017 period the timing of payments on the new series e convertible debentures one in july 2018 and two annually going forward in january and july the reduction in debt levels and the reduced spread on the company s credit facilities distributions from unconsolidated affiliates increased 7 9 million but this was partly a timing issue as the september distribution from orlando was not received until october 1 3 6 million chambers had an increase of 4 2 million due to lower operation and maintenance expenditures and a release of working capital these factors which positively affected cash flow were partially offset by lower project adjusted ebitda for the quarter as previously discussed cash used in investing activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 1 million compared to a 1 4 million source of funds in the fourth quarter of 2017 cash used in financing activities for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 27 1 million as compared to 82 1 million in the year ago period the company repaid 20 8 million of term loan and project debt repurchased 4 3 million of common shares and paid 2 0 million of preferred dividends in the comparable 2017 period the company repaid 79 6 million of term loan and project debt including piedmont in full and paid 2 2 million of preferred dividends during the fourth quarter the company had a 12 5 million net increase in cash restricted cash and cash equivalents financial results for the year ended december 31 2018 key drivers the most significant drivers of full year results were the expirations early terminations and short term extensions of the ppas at kapuskasing and north bay the san diego projects and williams lake and as previously described maintenance costs associated with the tunis re start in the first six months of 2018 and the manchief gas turbine overhaul in the second quarter of 2018 and lower water flows at curtis palmer than in 2017 though they were very close to average these declines were partially offset by increases at morris mamquam frederickson orlando and nipigon net income loss project income loss and project adjusted ebitda net income attributable to atlantic power corporation for 2018 was 36 8 million compared to a net loss of 98 6 million in 2017 the 135 4 million improvement was primarily attributable to a 135 6 million increase in project income discussed below a 39 1 million increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain 22 8 million gain versus a 16 3 million loss which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars due to the depreciation of the canadian dollar during the year compared to an appreciation in 2017 and to higher canadian debt instruments due to the issuance of the series e convertible debenture in january 2018 an 11 5 million reduction in corporate interest expense as a result of debt repayment and re pricing of the company s credit facilities and a 3 2 million unrealized gain on the fair value of the conversion option of the series e debentures these positive factors were partially offset by a 58 3 million reduction in income tax benefit project income for 2018 increased to 88 2 million from a project loss of 47 4 million in 2017 the 135 6 million improvement was primarily attributable to the non recurrence of 187 1 million of impairment expense recorded in 2017 a 15 7 million reduction in interest expense due to lower debt balances and the reduced spread on the company s credit facilities in addition the company recorded a purchase accounting gain of 7 2 million on the acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in koma kulshan also morris orlando and other projects had increases in project income these positive variances were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from the ppa expirations previously discussed the non recurrence of the oefc settlement revenues and maintenance expense associated with the tunis re start and the manchief gas turbine overhaul project adjusted ebitda for 2018 declined to 185 1 million from 288 8 million in 2017 the 103 7 million decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of contracts at kapuskasing and north bay at year end 2017 71 3 million the early termination of the ppas for the three san diego projects effective march 1 2018 24 0 million maintenance expenses incurred at tunis in preparation for re start incurred in 2018 and the non recurrence of oefc settlement revenues recorded in 2017 9 0 million a less favorable short term ppa at williams lake partially offset by cost reductions 8 4 million maintenance expenses associated with the manchief gas turbine overhaul in the second quarter of 2018 5 5 million and lower water flows at curtis palmer 2 8 million partially offsetting these decreases were increases at morris 7 4 million due to a higher capacity price realized in the pjm capacity auction for this year higher steam and ancillary services revenues higher merchant dispatch and lower expenses mamquam 3 3 million due to higher water flows and lower maintenance expense frederickson 3 0 million due to maintenance expense in 2017 and orlando 2 9 million due to higher availability and higher contractual capacity rates cash flow cash provided by operating activities declined 31 7 million to 137 5 million in 2018 from 169 2 million in 2017 results were negatively affected by the 103 7 million reduction in project adjusted ebitda however this impact was partially offset by 39 3 million of net favorable changes in working capital particularly a 20 6 million decrease in working capital at kapuskasing north bay and the three san diego projects as they were not in operation at year end 2018 in addition cash interest payments were 30 7 million lower in 2018 than in 2017 as a result of debt repayment and a lower spread on the company s credit facilities and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates increased 14 3 million mostly at chambers and orlando cash used in investing activities in 2018 was 17 0 million compared to 4 3 million in 2017 in 2018 the company used 12 8 million of cash net of cash received to acquire additional ownership interests in koma kulshan and buy out the operation and maintenance contract and 2 6 million for the deposit required under the agreement to acquire the two south carolina biomass plants capital expenditures in the 2018 period were 1 8 million as compared to 5 3 million in 2017 cash used in financing activities in 2018 was 135 0 million as compared to 178 9 million in 2017 in 2018 the company issued 92 2 million

million at september 30 2018 cash increased 10 7 million while revolver availability was nearly unchanged the increase in cash was attributable to discretionary cash flow generated during the quarter

guidance the company has not provided guidance for project income or net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable gaap metrics including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses these factors which generally do not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda the company has initiated guidance for 2019 project adjusted ebitda in the range of 175 million to 190 million the midpoint of this guidance range is in line with the 2018 actual result of 185 1 million the most significant factor negatively affecting 2019 results is the short term contract extension at williams lake which became effective in april 2018 and is scheduled to expire in june or possibly as late as september of this year in 2018 williams lake had project adjusted ebitda of 8 0 million but this included three months under the previous contract results in 2019 are expected to be significantly lower project adjusted ebitda for tunis and manchief is expected to be significantly higher this year due to start up and

thanks bob and good morning and thank you for joining us q4 was a solid quarter that capped off a great year for hilton grand vacations as our teams did an outstanding job executing against our strategic priorities advertisement advertisement so let me highlight some of our key accomplishments we delivered on our financial commitments with strong contract sales revenue and earnings that met our growth objectives we continue to grow our installed base of members with our 26th consecutive year of positive net owner growth we expanded on our global footprint launching new properties in hawaii japan and barbados these are the leading edge of a multi year product offensive that will drive contract sales and earnings growth for many years to come our resort and club teams continue to win awards and accolades for the quality of our properties and the high level of service we provide and importantly we began returning cash to our shareholders under the capital allocation framework we outlined at our investor day in december turning to results 2018 was a really strong year with contract sales growing by 10 6 we anticipated sales to moderate in the fourth quarter due to reduced availability of certain inventory types and given how front loaded sales were earlier in the year with that and to a lesser extent the elevated noise we saw in the financial markets our pace moderated to 6 2 our earnings momentum remained on track and adjusted ebitda came in at the high end of our guidance our sales team did amazing job of executing on our plan for the year we saw double digit sales growth in orlando new york and oahu demonstrating in our consistent execution and the resiliency of customer demand in these important legacy markets advertisement advertisement newer distribution centers like hilton head and washington d c saw impressive contract sales growth in the 40 range our japanese business remained strong and we finished the year with over 61 000 japanese owners and double digit contract sales growth the key driver of our strong contract sales growth this year was our marketing teams ability to grow tours by 8 we again finished the year with first time buyers representing approximately half of our sales and even with this industry leading first time buyer mix our vpgs grew 2 4 surpassing 3 700 for the first time in our history we saw consistent growth in our high margin resort and club management segment throughout the year as revenues increased 15 adjusted ebitda increased by 20 and margins topped 58 we added 20 000 net owners and at year end our owner base stood at 309 000 by installing 7 more owners to our base we ve embedded significant future value into our business from the recurring stream of high margin fee income and from the highly predictable patterns of real estate upgrades our resort and club team is responsible for keeping our members active and engaged which helps support our net owner growth strategy they booked over 1 million vacations for our members last year with self service reservations on our website or app increasing by 29 last year our properties achieved an overall quality assurance rating of 94 6 which ranks us outstanding and is among the highest of all hilton brands and we re not just winning and being recognized within the hilton ecosystem aaa four diamond rating to just 6 of the hotels that evaluate each year and we re proud to say that nine of our properties have earned that distinction our rental business had great years the quin and other new properties added more rooms to our rental pool rental revenues increased 22 on higher availability a 1 point improvement in occupancy to 87 and the 7 point gain in adr advertisement advertisement as we move into this year we re excited about our portfolio expansion with sequels ph myrtle beach hilton head in new york and new market rollouts in charleston chicago and cabo keep in mind that the timing of these introductions is more weighted to the back half of the year so you should expect to see our sales momentum build as the year unfolds select properties will open in the back half of 2019 and are important sales catalysts for this year s sales plan because they stimulate upgrade interest from existing owners and they open up access to pools of potential to new owners as we think about new owner growth our working relationship with hilton is as strong as its ever been and our access to new hilton loyalty customers continues to be robust two weeks ago hilton reported that their honors program grew 20 in 18 and reached 85 million members being fully aligned with the world s most valuable hotel brands and industry s fastest growing customer loyalty program is a clear competitive advantage now looking a little farther out over the last 20 years our owners have rated maui as the number one market they would like us to ph enter last month we could finally answer that call as we announced maui bay villas this 388 units resort is located on the island southwest coast and will be our 10th property in hawaii we re very excited about this project and expect to start sales in early 2020 and complete the first stage of construction in 21 advertisement advertisement in our first two years we re making very good progress in identifying and making investments into the business to accelerate our growth we remain the industry leader in capital efficient inventory sourcing and we were able to translate that into a return on invested capital of over 25 last year in addition to developing our own inventory we continue to leverage our relationships with partners like blackstone goldman sachs mori trust and the related companies to source capital efficient inventory having the ability to obtain inventory across multiple channels is a significant competitive advantage because we ve been able to fund our growth without taxing our balance sheet we were able to start returning capital to our shareholders last year under the 200 million share repurchase program our board approved in november we bought back 2 5 million shares or about 2 6 of our shares outstanding going forward capital return will remain a priority at our investor day we introduced you to our new cfo dan mathewes dan has great experience across all finance functions and really hit the ground running and you ll hear from dan here in a moment advertisement advertisement we also found the right coo in gordon gurnik gordon has more than 30 years of experience in the industry and most recently served as a president of rci and found is probably not the right word because i actually have known gordon for 20 years and he has a stellar reputation throughout the industry i m very pleased with how seamlessly dan and gordon have integrated into the management team as 2019 gets under way we re well positioned for sustained growth we reiterate our 19 guidance and we expect to start seeing financial benefits from the investments we ve made making to take hold as the year progresses and it s not just 2019 as we expect to build additional momentum heading into 2020 and 21 helping to accelerate our earnings and free cash flow which is consistent with our long term objectives you know we ve talked at length at our recent investor day about our strategic growth priorities for 19 and beyond so i m not going to repeat myself but if there is a theme to the next several years that i want to make sure is clear to everyone it s one of growth innovation and resiliency advertisement advertisement we spent a lot of time internally and with our board of directors talking about the business we re constantly analyzing the industry assessing the financial markets listening to our members and engaging our shareholders as a result we have full confidence in our growth strategy which we believe positions us well to create meaningful value for our team members owners and shareholders i ll now turn it over to dan to walk you through our financial results in more detail dan daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mark and good morning everyone just a quick reminder before i get into the numbers all comparisons i will discuss this morning are between 2017 results and 2018 results under poc accounting as mark highlighted we finished the year strong hitting our contract sales adjusted ebitda and eps guidance we saw solid results in real estate and finance this quarter and exceptional results in resort and club in real estate tours and contract sales volumes increased for both owners and first time buyers vpg declined slightly due to the inventory availability and market noise that mark talked about earlier segment revenues increased 13 to 365 million while segment adjusted ebitda increased 5 to 101 million for the quarter resort operations and club management segment revenues increased 23 to 119 million while segment adjusted ebitda increased 29 to 66 million segment margins expanded by 290 basis points to 55 5 companywide adjusted ebitda increased by 13 for the quarter to 114 million and by 10 for the year to 435 million now let s go through the details and highlights for the quarter and year total company revenue in q4 increased 15 to 513 million reflecting growth in all business lines net income was 66 million and diluted eps was 0 69 compared to q4 2017 net income did decreased 64 and as you ll recall we received 132 million deferred tax benefit last year under the new tax law our effective tax rate for 2018 normalized in the 26 range fourth quarter real estate results were solid as contract sales increased 6 2 to 360 million strong demand for grand islander helped drive 8 6 fee for service contract sales growth in q4 while owned contract sales grew by 3 3 the fee for service mix was 56 in q4 up slightly from 55 last year our full year fee for service mix was 55 which was in line with the high end of our guidance in the real estate business line q4 revenues increased 14 to 285 million and margin increased 10 to 88 million the real estate margin percentage came in at 30 9 down 120 basis points from q4 2017 for the year contract sales increased 10 6 to 1 4 billion real estate revenues increased 13 to 1 1 billion and margin increased 7 2 to 329 million the real estate margin percentage came in at 30 8 which is down 160 basis points from 2017 margins were negatively impacted by the investments we ve made in infrastructure to bring new markets into the portfolio investments in building up our tour pipeline and higher product costs due to our sales mix turning to the financing business margin was flat in quarter as the incremental interest expense from the 350 million abs deal we completed in september offset the revenue benefit of portfolio growth and a slight improvement in the effective interest rate we re collecting for the year financing margin increased 4 8 to 109 million the financing margin percentage compressed 170 basis points but still stood at a healthy 69 looking at our year end consumer portfolio gross financing receivables increased by 80 million to 1 29 billion our average down payment increased to 12 2 from 11 7 and our average interest rate increased by 13 basis points to 12 28 our long term allowance stood flat at 13 3 compared to 11 7 11 6 ph at the end of last year but it s worth noting that we seem to stabilize over the past two quarters turning to our resort and club business line nog came in at 7 revenues for the quarter increased 12 to 56 million and margin increased 7 7 to 42 million the resort and club margin percentage came in at 75 which is down 300 basis points for the year resort and club revenue increased 8 9 to 172 million and margin increased 8 7 to 125 million the resort and club margin percentage was 72 7 in line with last year rental and ancillary revenues increased 32 in q4 to 54 million this reflects system growth and the incremental contribution from the quin in new york we will continue to operate the quin as a hotel through its conversion but its contribution to rental should moderate later this year as rooms come out of service for renovation q4 rental and ancillary margin more than doubled to 16 million and margin percentage expanded to 29 6 from 17 1 for the year rental and ancillary revenue increased 22 to 218 million and margin increased 49 to 85 million rental and ancillary margin percentage for the year was 39 a 720 basis point expansion over 2017 bridging the gap for q4 between segment adjusted ebitda and total company adjusted ebitda g a increased by 4 million license fees increased by 3 million and our jvs generated 1 million of adjusted ebitda q4 adjusted ebitda was 114 million at a margin of 22 2 for the year total adjusted ebitda increased 10 1 to 435 million at a margin of 22 8 turning to the balance sheet mark mentioned but it s worth repeating we repurchased 2 5 million shares in the quarter at an average price of 28 62 in aggregate we spent 71 million which leaves 129 million of capacity left under our current 200 million authorization we look forward to updating you on q1 repurchase progress on our next earnings call in early may we funded the repurchases with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolver as you ll recall we refinanced our credit facility in late november refinancing our 200 million term loan and expanding our revolver to 800 million we drew 16 million off the new revolver to fund the buybacks at quarter end corporate leverage was 1 1 times on a net basis as we outlined during our investor day we are ready to use our balance sheet with up to 1 5 to 2 times of net leverage to support our capital allocation priorities we believe that this gives us the ability to fund capital returns while still preserving adequate balance sheet flexibility to adapt to a variety of economic circumstances looking at our liquidity position we ended the year with 108 million of unrestricted cash and capacity at roughly 684 million on our revolver and 330 million on our warehouse corporate debt was 604 million and our non recourse debt balance was 759 million adjusted free cash flow was negative 44 million for the year which was in line with our expectations now turning to guidance with the exception of eps we are reiterating the full year 2019 guidance that we provided at investor day we expect contract sales growth of 9 to 11 with a fee for service mix of 48 to 54 we re forecasting adjusted ebitda of 450 million to 470 million and net income of 260 million to 275 million adjusting our share count for the 2 5 million shares we repurchased in the fourth quarter we are raising our eps guidance range to 2 74 to 2 89 from our original estimate of 2 68 to 2 84 no additional share repurchases are assumed in our guidance please note that the percentage of completion or poc was retired at the end of 2018 as such beginning in the first quarter we will no longer bridge gaap results to poc so just to be clear 2019 guidance is in asc 606 as many of you have likely already seen we have provided supplemental data on the construction related deferrals and recognitions included in our reported results this information for 2018 is provided in supplemental tables in our current earnings release a file with the historical quarterly data through 2015 is posted on our investor relations website going forward we will update this file every quarter this information should help you look at the business the way we look at the business and more clearly assess period over period growth rates for example the 503 million of adjusted ebitda under asc 606 we reported in 2018 included a 79 million benefit from net construction related recognitions so internally when we think about growth between 2018 and 2019 our 2018 base is our adjusted ebitda of 503 million less the 79 million of recognitions which gives us 424 million off this base our 2019 adjusted ebitda guidance of 450 million to 470 million represents growth in the range of 6 to 11 or 8 5 at the midpoint our 2019 guidance does not assume any full year deferrals or recognitions that being said depending on project timing we may see some intra quarter deferrals within the year we will guide you accordingly to those as we anticipate them we do not anticipate any deferrals in q1 on the topic of q1 i wanted to walk you through a quick example of how to use the supplemental tables we posted on the ir site if you look at q1 2018 we reported adjusted ebitda of 62 million that included 37 million of net deferrals so the right way to think about your base for modeling q1 2019 is 99 million so you can just repeat this process for the balance of the quarters and the years finally just a few comments about the cadence of the quarters this year while we don t provide quarterly guidance there s a few things to keep in mind as you think about 2019 first 2018 got off to a very strong start with ocean tower second our 2019 projects will come in line in the mid to latter part of the year if you look at our adjusted ebitda over the past two years without the deferral noise it splits roughly 50 50 between the front and back half of the year given our timing expectations in 2019 our split is likely to be a couple of points heavier in the back half of the year feel free to give bob a call to work through these details this completes our prepared remarks we ll now turn the call over to the operator and we look forward to your questions greg questions and answers operator thank you sir operator instructions all right and first from goldman sachs we have stephen grambling stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst hey thanks i guess first starting with the buyback what are the key things you are evaluating when thinking about starting the buyback and will the future deployment be opportunistic or systematic daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks stephen when we were thinking about the buyback i mean i think the best place to search is to reiterate what we said on the investor day back in december from a capital allocation strategy we were very focused on organic growth and we ve obviously laid out the investments over the next few years on that very front our next priority was definitely repurchasing shares returning capital to shareholders via a repurchase share program i think everybody agree where we are in a growth strategy that is a better gives us more optionality it s a better option for us now from where we stand from a dividend versus a dividend perspective going forward we constantly and routinely look at different options to repurchase shares but our focus is to be very disciplined but at the same time very measured so we re looking to make sure that we have the flexibility with our balance sheet as we move forward so we will leverage our balance sheet to the tune of 1 5 to 2 times as we mentioned on investor day but from a how do we do that on the repurchase share front that s something we ll update you on as we progress stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst and maybe changing gears as a follow up you gave a lot of good detail on the deferrals but how should we think about the fee for service upgrades and the net impact to ebitda in 19 sic and going forward daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the easiest way to think about the fee for service upgrade is take that into consideration where our mix is today so when we look at 2019 we re looking at a mix that s coming down a hair it s not dropping dramatically but it is shifting more to owned contract so as we shift to more owned contract owned inventory excuse me sales that will naturally come down so in 2019 i would assume that would be of a similar level to slightly less and then as that shift is more pronounced in 2020 where will be sub 50 in 2021 where will be sub 40 you ll see more of a shift on that front stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst great and then one last one i ll sneak in is on the loan loss provision it looks like it was relatively unchanged from 3q i guess normally i would have expect that to kind of tick down from 4q to 3q are you seeing any changes in delinquencies or write offs has there been any response to requiring higher down payments on upgrade sales daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think first and foremost the first thing to address is any push back if you would or any impacted to sales by requiring additional down payments on those larger balances and we re very happy to say it s de minimis there s really no impact on the sales front so that s positive from our perspective and then when we think about our portfolio we look at the default rate year over year the default rate is up last year i think it was little bit over 4 1 and this year it s under 4 8 it s right at 4 7 but we ve seen some good movement from the aspect as we just mentioned that sales are not impacting by requiring additional down payments that we hope hopefully that will strengthen it and some of that degradation is as we mentioned on our last call from some of the higher credit worthy customers from japan how upgrading out of our paper into our fee for service partner s paper so that s where we see some of that but there s really no material change that we ve seen in the recent months on that front and keep in mind there is additional down payments that we re going to that we d required on those larger balance loans and upgrades that s going to take time to whittle through our portfolio so the real benefit we probably won t see for a couple of quarters from now stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst helpful thanks i ll jump back in the queue operator and moving on we have brandt montour with jpmorgan brandt montour jpmorgan analyst good morning everyone thanks for taking my question so net owner growth continues to be really impressive even stronger than maybe the levels that you said in the past is where you think it s sort of needs to be or kind of over that 5 growth mark so is that outperformance back to line ph or how do you continue to be so successful there mark wang chief executive officer and president well yeah brandt anyways good morning but first i d say it is core to our strategy it is absolutely the number one thing that we focus on as we develop our initiatives every year because we understand that the value that a new customer brings into our system and so i d say number one we are very pleased with the relationship we have with hilton and how we ve been able to engage hilton and access the hilton customers our relationship right now with them we have the leading call transfer program we were the first ones that started doing that in the branded space we have comprehensive exclusive rights for marketing with the branded hotels and any hilton branded hotel so no one else can move into those hotels other than us and then we re actively moving on the innovation side and developing new initiatives especially around digital and i haven t spoken much about those because i d rather get them done and proven and before i get out in front of it but millennials and gen xers are majority of our buyers today and we re enhancing our digital capabilities we know it s critical especially with this the new generation of customers coming in and it s not just in our marketing it s around our brand interaction it s around our customer service channels and we re adding capabilities for our owners as i talked about in my prepared remarks as you saw both digital and web reservations move up but there s a lot of opportunity we believe and increase in the number of leads that we get from hilton through digital channels and partnering closely with them and it s a good time for us as hilton is also investing heavily in those areas and so the relationship is good we ve got initiatives that hilton has with us that are that they re collaborating with us on and so i think over time you re going to see our business continue to expand using what i would call kind of more new age marketing brandt montour jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and then second question just given the choppiness that we all saw in the macro last year i think most people are happy enough to see you guys reaffirm contract sales guidance and so i don t want to seem like i m nitpicking here but just looking at the guidance for contract sales of 9 to 11 which at the midpoint is kind of right in line with what you ended up doing last year and yet you have several projects opening this year so i guess my question is are you baking in any conservatism into that range or is there there are tough comparisons from ocean tower maybe but your thoughts around that would be helpful and that s it from me thank you mark wang chief executive officer and president yeah thanks first of all there is no conservatism in that range it is an aggressive range and i m saying that i m being upfront with people it s we really outperformed last year if you think about our 10 5 growth for the full year it had outpaced the whole industry no one had that level of growth and as you mentioned we launched the first phase of ocean tower it was a strong catalyst for us and while we expected it to be well received it was more than tripled our expectations with most of those sales occurring in the first half of the year and what made ocean tower so appealing was it equally met demand from our new buyers as well as our existing owners so i would say that the guidance we put out there is it gives us based on the visibility we have today provides us the best view and we did see some impact from some some of the impact from the financial markets that happened last year but that was minor and if we look at the fourth quarter the fourth quarter sales contracted some that was more inventory related and as we talk about new projects for this year and inventory we re really excited about the expansion of our portfolio but it is back loaded and so you should expect that our sales momentum will build as the year goes forward and we re also coming off of 14 5 comparable in q1 so especially in q1 the comparable would makes it more difficult for strong growth but we are excited about the expansion and these will be meaningful for us toward the back half of 19 but actually more meaningful as we move into 20 and 21 brandt montour jpmorgan analyst thanks guys good results operator we ll move on to brian dobson with nomura instinet brian dobson nomura instinet analyst hi good morning so to what extent does your free cash flow ramp into 2023 give you confidence to draw down on your revolver to pull forward some of that capital return and also could you maybe just highlight some of the high level puts and takes that are driving that steep ramp into 22 23 thank you mark wang chief executive officer and president yes so i think as we provided in our investor day what gives us confidence is really the new properties that we re going to be putting in place and as we talked about when we get to 20 when we get out to the outer years our free cash flow in 2022 2023 is in the low fours to 500 million average range so i don t know if dan if you have anything else you want to add to that daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean i think that that s it i mean the real thing and i think we communicated fairly well on investor day is the investment we re making in inventory today is really resetting the level of the business so when we get into the out years you re looking at adjusted ebitda that is north of 650 million ph which translates into the adjusted free cash flow of 425 million to 500 million that we discussed mark wang chief executive officer and president yeah i d also say it s just another reflection on the fact that we continue to drive positive nog which we we know embeds significant amount of value into the business and is that nog as we embed value we re also extracting that value and last year if you look at transactions from new buyers that are up 10 so very very strong and that s coming off multiple years of really strong growth to new buyers so i think we re really well set up to be able to perform against the new investments that we re putting into inventory with the embedment of new customers that we ve added daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think the only thing i d add on that front is with this new inventory coming online and where we see growing that s what s giving us a lot of confidence in drawing on our revolver and levering up to repurchase shares in a reasonable amount of timeframe i know we discussed earlier not yeah we re looking at different avenues to do that and we very well may stay with an open market program but again that leverage target of 1 5 to 2 times that s something that we anticipate getting to sooner than later just to be clear on that part brian dobson nomura instinet analyst sounds good thanks very much operator next from suntrust we have patrick scholes patrick scholes suntrust analyst hi good morning i want to ask about your seven years of inventory i would say that s probably about the most that i can ever recall or at least been publicly disclosed by a company and certainly it s certainly not a bad thing but what is the right amount i mean would you see that whittling down over time and what would you see as perhaps your target for number of years of inventory mark wang chief executive officer and president yeah patrick this is mark look i think when you define our pipeline first of all we only have approximately 1 4 years of inventory today that s available for sale right so that pipeline is really it evolves through multiple stages right we ve got design we got construction we have government approvals for registration so we define our pipeline with anything that we see that we have either commitments to or future commitments to so to be clear it s seven years of inventory sitting unoccupied waiting to be sold it s not all ready for sales today so some sitting on our fee for service partners balance sheets some of it s sitting on our balance sheets but it s in various stages so we re unique right now in our space and that we continue to strong net on our growth which requires us to add inventory we re not getting the kind of inventory deck from our members to support the kind of growth we have and so the right amount it s really hard to pin point that but i feel really comfortable that the pipeline we have in front of us gives us ample inventory to meet the growth objectives that we ve laid out in investor day in december patrick scholes suntrust analyst very good thank you that was actually very interesting on not getting inventory back from your customers which is a good thing that s it from me thank you operator and next from wolfe research we have jared shojaian jared h shojaian wolfe research analyst hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question so maybe can you just elaborate a little bit more on the contract sales growth in the fourth quarter being a little bit lighter and specifically the vpg component what did you see with conversion rates specifically parsed out between first time buyers and existing owner upgrades and then can you talk about the trends so far year to date that you ve seen with i guess the volatility in the market calming down mark wang chief executive officer and president sure yeah so i would say number one when you look at the fourth quarter our owner behavior buy and take behavior patterns remained very strong we had double digit growth there where we did see some apprehension or maybe reduced commitment levels was from our new buyers and so but again we had anticipated sales were going to contract in the fourth quarter and it was more of an inventory mix it was more debt and it was i think the noise that was in the market but when you think about the type of customers that we re selling if i just look at our owner base today and let s translate that into the customers we re trying to sell the majority of our owners have net worth of over 1 million and so i assume that most of them have 401k plan so there was a lot of noise that converged at one particular time and so i don t i guess i m not surprised that there was some impact but again our belief it was more inventory related as when we built our model every year there is a number of factors that go into that and so with really tour flow and inventory being the key drivers and once we match those two metrics up we project the vpg which translates in the contract sales so we expect strong customer traffic and i think as we look forward with these new sales centers and inventory coming in chicago cabo and charleston and the expanded presence in the myrtle beach and hilton head in new york market we expect most of our growth really to come out toward the back half of the year jared h shojaian wolfe research analyst that s helpful thank you and i guess as a segue to your last comment i mean if the quarterly cadence is ramping quarter to quarter in 2019 then we could be looking at a scenario when the fourth quarter is nicely ahead of the full year guidance is that the right way to think about i guess the right run rate going into 2020 in terms of how contract sales could accelerate in 2020 versus 2019 is that how you re thinking about it right now daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think when it comes to hi jared it s dan i think when we look into 2020 that s going to be another evolution if you will on how projects unfold because remember a lot of the inventory spend that we re committed to those projects are in different phases of development so there s always a timing element where it could shift between quarters so i wouldn t start with a run rate in q4 of 2019 i think you re going to have to look to us to provide a little bit more color as we get closer to that point in time hope that s somewhat helpful jared h shojaian wolfe research analyst okay thank you and one more from me if i may the fee for service mix came up a little bit of your guidance for 2019 can you talk about that and then i guess separately due to higher product costs that you ve called out does that have anything to do with just general and inflationary trends and tighter construction supplier or anything of that nature mark wang chief executive officer and president yeah i ll take the first part of that question then i ll pass it to dan on the cop costs yeah from a guidance standpoint we re guiding 48 to 54 on our fee this year and in 2020 it drops just below 50 and then 2021 it drops below 40 now that s how we have it structured today that s how we re guiding to it today we have the ability to pivot and do more fee should an opportunity come about or should the market dictate that so and then as far as the cost goes daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah as long as the as far as the cost go jared from a cost of product perspective it s not really inflationary it s really it truly is the mix of sales more than anything else and as we progress and that pendulum shifts from fee for service to owned inventory the margin percentage will get compressed of the actual dollars that you see running through our p l revenue and translating into ebitda will include so it s really more of a sales mix more than anything else to be perfectly honest jared h shojaian wolfe research analyst got it thank you very much for the time mark wang chief executive officer and president thank you operator next from jefferies we have david katz david katz jefferies analyst hi thanks for taking my question i m just curious thinking long term i think we ve all maybe gotten sort of sucked ph into quarters and thinking about cadence and so forth if we were to draw kind of a long term trend line for how you think the business can grow the next several years how would you sort of help us think about that you obviously do take a long term view on the business mark wang chief executive officer and president yeah look i think as we talked about back in december we re expecting sales growth in that 9 to 11 9 to 12 range and in both contract sales and in adjusted ebitda adjusted free cash flow we re expecting to ramp up to 250 million to 300 million by 2021 and if you take a look at the individual projects view as we illustrated at investor day the cash flow will continue to grow beyond five years so i think that s what we ve talked about here most recently david katz jefferies analyst and i apologize if i sort of missed any commentary on this but just thinking about more geographies and which ones are at or near the top of the list or how long the list that is i know expanding into new geographies an important part of that growth how are you thinking about that and that s it from me mark wang chief executive officer and president well it s no that s it could get great question and of course we talked about the ones today that are more immediate 19 and 20 we announced sesoko in japan really excited about that opportunity that ll be the really the first big property that we re going to be able to expand into and to what i consider to be a really comparable market potentially to hawaii for the japanese market and also some of the other asian customers out there china and korea in particular so beyond that we ve got a number of different markets that we re looking at we re not going to talk about in any detail today what they are but west coast continues to be an opportunity for us and as we look at our member base we ve got 50000 members in california alone so the west coast is a and california in particular is a market of great interest and texas is also another very interesting market for us it s texas is our third highest number of owners reside in texas so i think geographically there s a number of opportunities we re looking at right now but we re not going to provide you any specifics at this point david katz jefferies analyst thank you very nice quarter mark wang chief executive officer and president thank you operator operator instructions moving on we have a follow up from stephen grambling with goldman sachs stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst hey thanks for sneaking me back on the i guess on upgrades and the amount of money being put down or the down payment i guess what percentage of upgrades put money down and what is the typical amount that s put down on average for upgrades mark wang chief executive officer and president yeah well we ve instituted additional 10 so previous to that change in our underwriting guidelines we were just allowing them to use our equity for their upgrade sales so i don t know if that answers your question or not daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and just to add further color i mean we ve started the institute that and now we re getting close to 90 of upgrades are putting down new money mark wang chief executive officer and president okay stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and one other one is just what s the minimum kind of cash commitment on inventory required in 19 and 20 daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer well the tax commitment on the inventory that we talked about on investor day was 315 million to 365 million in 19 and 375 million to 425 million in 20 stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst thanks again daniel j mathewes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen at

elver special rapporteur on the right to food presented her fifth thematic report and her reports on official country visits to viet nam indonesia and argentina the thematic report focused on fishery workers and their role in the realization of the right to food fishery workers were instrumental to the realization of the right to food and nutrition of the world s population yet they were amongst the poorest viet nam indonesia and argentina spoke as concerned countries the national commission on human rights of indonesia also spoke in a video message juan pablo bohoslavsky independent expert on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights presented the guiding principles on human rights impact assessments of economic reforms which were born out of the increasing recognition that human rights were often peripheral concerns in the development of policy responses to economic crises he spoke of his country visits to ukraine and sri lanka sri lanka and ukraine spoke as concerned countries the national human rights commission of sri lanka and the ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights also spoke in video messages in the ensuing discussion on the reports of the special rapporteur speakers said that the fundamental role that fishery workers played to deal with the growing global demand for fish consumption was recognized recommendations in the report on the right to food were strengthening the rights based approach in the fishing sector which played a strong part of the economy in many countries speakers regretted that working conditions and remuneration for fisher folk both on the sea and inland were often forgotten by public policies concerning the reports of the independent expert speakers said that despite measures taken to improve the economic situation for countries in the region africa remained a continent in great debt foreign debt was noted as being indicative of the lack of justice in the flow of capital in the world there were links between debts and low rates of growth and it was concerning that lending policies of the international financial institutions continued to use gross domestic product as a sole criterion speaking in the discussion were european union angola on behalf of the african group kuwait spain pakistan holy see sudan india brazil palestine tunisia cuba jordan iraq djibouti russia

afternoon to hold a clustered interactive dialogue with the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the special rapporteur on torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment right of reply china speaking in a right of reply said that statements made by other states regarding xinjiang province were simply untrue and emphasized that they did not sit well with the principle of international cooperation china explained that under the leadership of the communist party the region was seeing increased harmony and stability a number of counterterrorism measures had been taken in accordance with chinese law and these had improved the human rights situation of the people in xinjiang china emphasized that it was an open and hospitable country and welcome all united nations officials to pay a visit to xinjiang india speaking in a right of reply said it was not surprised by statements made by pakistan a country that had long supported cross border terrorism india drew attention to the recent terrorist attack which it said was only one of many such attacks perpetrated against india india expected pakistan to take immediate and verifiable action against terrorism and called on that country not to misuse the principle of self determination as a mechanism to erode the territorial integrity of india india was a pluralistic democracy which guaranteed freedom to all its people freedoms which pakistan had never truly enjoyed bahrain speaking in a right of reply on behalf of saudi arabia united arab emirates and egypt on allegations contained in the statement of the delegation of qatar said they had taken measures in order to protect their national security as qatar was working to destabilize their countries the four states were concerned about terrorist attempts there was framework in place to resolve the crisis and the four states were ready to cooperate to resolve the crisis qatar had tried to internationalize the crisis in a desperate attempt responding to the delegation of denmark bahrain believed that what happened with its citizens was a matter of its own sovereignty the citizen was sanctioned by the penal code so interference was not accepted armenia speaking in a right of reply in response to allegations made by azerbaijan and turkey said that turkey was far from living in democratic conditions so it could hardly talk about human rights violations thousands of journalists were in jail in turkey and their speech was considered an act of confrontation the armenian genocide was one of the worst and hardest crimes of ottoman turkey and turkey was still denying it turkish propaganda on nagorno karabakh was not true and turkey was called to reconsider its views on nagorno karabakh as for azerbaijan it was presenting falsified narrative concerning the ethnic cleansing of the armenian population democratic people s republic of korea speaking in a right of reply said that some countries were using fabricated stories and groundless accusations against them including the united kingdom and japan those allegations were of a political nature and had nothing to do with human rights those countries should look at their own human rights records the abduction issue was used for japan s internal use as the democratic people s republic of korea had done everything to resolve it japan still had to resolve the issue of comfort women and slave labour of koreans during their occupation republic of korea speaking in a right of reply said that the issue of comfort women was not only a bilateral issue it was a matter of universal rights pertaining to sexual violence lessons from history had to be learnt the korean government believed that previous attempts to resolve the problem lacked a victim centred approach many united nations mechanisms suggested to put the victim at the centre of the approach the korean government continued to cooperate with international mechanisms so that victims could get a brighter future cyprus speaking in a right of reply said that turkey had made many accusations to the council which seemed trite considering their own human rights record for instance charging human rights activists the lack of integrity of the judiciary the lack of independent and thorough investigations into allegations of torture and the refusal to apply human right court judgements the basis of resolving the conflict in cyprus was reunification which the government was actively working towards turkey speaking in a right of reply said it was facing unprecedented challenges to its integrity due to a number of terrorist organizations working within and beyond its borders the pluralistic nature of its society was important and integral to turkey but freedom of expression did not extend to terrorists who would undermine that integrity nevertheless the rule of law continued to be upheld with utmost integrity armenia was solely responsible for the occupation of 30 per cent of azerbaijan and turkey supported the resolution of the conflict with azerbaijan granting full autonomy to the contested region the council was not the space to discuss the suffering of the armenian people during world war one as it was out of its purview they did not speak of a genocide in cyprus the only occupation was that of greece pakistan speaking in a right of reply rejected india s assertion that the recent pulwama incident took place in india but rather in the indian occupied territory of kashmir pakistan emphatically rejected any allegations of links to the attack noting that these knee jerk accusations were well rehearsed tactics from the indian playbook pakistan emphasized that it was not involved in the pulwama attack india s unprecedented level of repression had resulted in the complete alienation of kashmiri resistance india s purported claims of targeting a large terrorist camp were completely absurd as the indian explosives had landed in an uninhabited airspace pakistan noted that its air force had undertaken strikes against indian territory which avoided any civilian casualties lebanon speaking in a right of reply said that israel was making use of the deliberations of the council for its own political purposes the persistence of israel to change historical facts and to disseminate falsehoods only deceived those who did not want to acknowledge truth for political reasons was there any wise person who thought that a power conceived under the base of colonialism could be a model of democracy israel had been launching false accusations against lebanon despite the fact that israel was the one violating lebanon s territorial integrity lebanon rejected the assertion that hezbollah was a terrorist group noting that it was a major lebanese party bangladesh speaking in a right of reply noted that while the situation in rakhine state had complex historical roots to claim that the conflict had emerged from illegal cross border movement made the possibility of addressing the root cause of the crisis rather bleak myanmar ascribed the exodus of people to seeds of terror sown by the arakan rohingya salvation army which was a misrepresentation of facts bangladesh called on the real perpetrators of the atrocities to be brought to justice bangladesh noted that repatriation should be the overriding priority for solving this humanitarian crisis it underlined that there had been grave systematic and egregious human rights abuses committed against the rohningya and others in myanmar syria speaking in a right of reply said that the british and danish ministers had launched accusations against syria ignoring the flagrant human rights violations within their own countries syria reminded all countries that they ought to look at their own countries before giving lessons to others regarding the statement made by turkey on monday syria stated that turkey was hiding behind the fight against terrorism in order to justify attacks against syria which was nothing more than an effort to distort truth and reality in order to achieve its own objectives syria also condemned turkey for opening its border to thousands of terrorists who came to syria to join the ranks of daesh azerbaijan speaking in a right of reply said that armenian allegations were baseless the so called sumgait incident was investigated at the time of the soviet union and the investigation revealed that it was a well prepared incident by masterminds in armenia to provoke the events and to use it as tool of propaganda and inspire national sentiments so they would later take part of azerbaijani territory instead of attacking when would armenia open a trial for the khojaly massacre japan speaking in a right of reply said that allegations made by the democratic people s republic of korea and the republic of korea were untrue under the stockholm agreement the democratic people s republic of korea was obliged to carry out investigations concerning all japanese persons including abductees and the democratic people s republic of korea was urged to respect the stockholm agreement as for the republic of korea under the december 2015 agreement it was confirmed by both parties that the issue of comfort women was resolved and japan was fulfilling all obligations made in the agreement india speaking in a second right of reply said that the only objective of pakistan in the council was to spread malicious propaganda against india pakistan forgot united nations resolutions and had never fulfilled its obligations to leave the occupied territory minorities in pakistan were harassed through blasphemy laws and targeted measures and millions of innocent persons had endured enforced disappearances and torture democratic people s republic of korea speaking in a second right of reply was disappointed with the evasive response of japan particularly concerning sexual violence it denounced sexual slavery of korean children in japanese schools during the war the crimes against humanity committed by japan had been documented and proven during the second world war including sexual slavery japan was urged to take a sincere approach concerning the so called abduction issue pakistan speaking in a second right of reply said that india s uncalled for attack on pakistan was part of a baseless polemical campaign to discredit pakistan and that these lies would not stand up in a court of law the human rights situation in kashmir a disputed territory where india was the usurper and occupier was the source of the instability pakistan pondered how the presence of 70 000 troops posted along the indian border were unable to stop the illegal border crossing of terrorist groups into kashmir it accused india of barbaric repression and of being a sham democracy and stated that the office of the high commissioner for human rights was not biased against india republic of korea speaking in a second right of reply stated it would not repeat points on former comfort women but reiterated hope that japan would heed its previous recommendations in accordance with the human rights framework set out by this council japan speaking in second right of reply said that there were no discriminatory policies against korean schools in japan the term sex slaves should not be used in lieu of comfort women japan had sincerely addressed the issue and it was now finally and irreversibly resolved japan urged the republic of korea to steadily implement the agreement and reiterated the importance of overcoming history and seeking a bright and peaceful future for the region qatar speaking in a right of reply said that the actions taken by the siege countries against qatar violated international human rights law qatar expressed its willingness to accept a peaceful resolution to the crisis within the framework of international law it was highly dangerous to see that the besieging countries were linking qatar to terrorism with no grounds a claim that certain other countries were supporting turkey speaking in a second right of reply condemned the unfounded accusations made by the syrian regime turkey recalled the track record of the syrian regime of mass killings the use of chlorine gas and repression of its people it was a comedy that the representative for syria was desperately trying to spread lies and falsehoods to mask syria s crimes against humanity turkey remained committed to the territorial integrity of syria syria speaking in a second right of reply said that the terminology used by the turkish delegate was evidence to the mentality predominating turkey and governing the erdogan regime syria referred to the illegitimate practices perpetrated by the turkish government against the syrian people it noted that the illegitimate occupation by turkey of syrian territory ran against the claims of the erdogan regime that it would respect syrian territorial integrity syria called upon the erdogan regime to respect human rights myanmar speaking in a right of reply said that myanmar s minister had already presented the situation in rakhine state in detail concerning the repatriation myanmar was cooperating with bangladesh both parties had agreed and reaffirmed desire to cooperate and maintain neighbourly relations hope was expressed that all challenges would be overcome and that the repatriation would be successful documentation the council has before it the report of the special rapporteur on the right to food a hrc 40 56 the council has before an addendum to the report of

on human rights hilal elver special rapporteur on the right to food presented her fifth thematic report and her reports on official country visits to viet nam indonesia and argentina the thematic report focused on fishery workers and their role in the realization of the right to food to be read in conjunction with the report on the right to food of agricultural workers and their critical role in realizing global access to food as they faced similar challenges fishery workers were instrumental to the realization of the right to food and nutrition of the world s population yet they were amongst the poorest their working conditions were not provided for within the international labour organization s framework and many workers lived below the poverty line and did not benefit from national labour or social protection schemes the strenuous working conditions were disproportionately suffered by women and vulnerable people including migrant workers indigenous people and children indeed the international labour organization estimated that 60 per cent of child labourers 129 million children worked in the agricultural sector which included fisheries and aquaculture during her trip to viet nam the special rapporteur noted that remarkable economic growth had dramatically transformed the country and its levels of poverty and hunger though rural areas and ethnic minorities still faced inequalities however this growth had had adverse impacts on the environment natural resources and the livelihood of local communities therefore she urged the government to follow sustainable development principles to protect the environment on her trip to indonesia ms elver noted the triple burden of malnutrition undernutrition and obesity which may have been linked to the government over its focus on the production of rice and staples and recommended new policies focused on the diversification of production including fruits and vegetables she stressed that some groups and individuals including women and children faced severe discrimination and obstacles such as access to land fisheries business practices climate change infrastructure and trade to enjoying their right to food the special rapporteur said she had visited argentina during a severe economic and financial crisis which had had a direct impact on the people s right to food and on their livelihoods she reiterated the importance of promoting and protecting family farming as a means to achieve a balance between robust industrial agriculture and developing an agro ecological production system and access to nutritious food for the people she encouraged the government to prioritize the implementation of effective policies and reforms with the participation of all relevant actors to ensure the right to food for all including indigenous people and those under the poverty line juan pablo bohoslavsky independent expert on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights presented the guiding principles on human rights impact assessments of economic reforms which were born out of the increasing recognition that human rights were often peripheral concerns in the development of policy responses to economic crises the fundamental premise of these guiding principles was the recognition that any economic reform measures had significant implications for the enjoyment of all human rights the guiding principles reaffirmed and systematized the existing international human rights law and standards that applied to economic policymaking and laid out how human rights impact assessments enabled states international financial institutions creditors and others to ensure that economic reforms advanced the goal of progressively realizing human rights mr bohoslavsky emphasized that governments at all levels should carry out both ex ante and ex post assessments paying particular attention to specific groups which were most vulnerable to the adverse impact of economic reforms such as women persons with disabilities indigenous peoples and minorities the guiding principles highlighted the important role of other relevant actors such as international financial institutions creditors and donors in carrying out human rights impact assessments acting in good faith these actors should properly take into account the impact of human rights on a given population regarding his visit to ukraine mr bohoslavsky noted that over the past 10 years the country had faced significant economic challenges exemplified by recession and currency devaluation requiring extensive fiscal consolidation measures in mitigating the impact of severe economic reforms the government had adopted various measures to address poverty inflation and the dire social situation of a majority of its population however the report concluded that important challenges remained to striking the right balance between seeking to foster economic development under the given circumstances and ensuring the realization of all human rights he noted that the austerity measures implemented as part of the fiscal consolidation required by the international monetary fund had included specific measures that disproportionately impacted the human rights of women the report concluded that rooting out endemic corruption could not be achieved without a holistic approach on the visit to sri lanka the independent expert noted that sri lanka had taken steps to boost growth and consolidate peace and democracy leading to important public investment programmes and economic measures there was a consensus that a greater mobilization of resources was necessary a more equitable fiscal system was also needed to expand the fiscal space and resources available for the progressive realization of economic social and cultural rights mr bohoslavsky expressed concern about impacts of ongoing reforms on public spending and some social sectors the report recommended that human rights impact assessments should be conducted systematically prior to the adoption of economic reforms in order to evaluate potential human rights risks and to avoid retrogression statements by concerned countries argentine speaking as a concerned country expressed satisfaction at the special rapporteur s visit to argentina and reiterated that the country supported strengthening special procedures according to resolution 5 21 human rights mechanisms had to be independent objective and impartial and argentina was happy that ms elver fully complied with that mandate the report recognized that argentina expressed cooperation and contribution of national authorities in different provinces it also recognized efforts that argentina was investing in improving the situation

special rapporteur had been implemented such as diversification of policies lowering food prices incorporating the cultural context targeting most vulnerable groups accelerating land redistribution policies and ensuring that business respected human rights however a clearer context had to be set on several points first indonesia did not recognize the term indigenous people when the declaration was adopted indonesia made an explanation of the vote outlining that as a multi ethnic society that had not changed since the time of colonization the term indigenous was not applicable the special rapporteur had jumped to a conclusion by stating that the measles breakout and malnutrition that occurred in one of 34 provinces was the result of the government s failure to fulfil the right to food this was over simplifying the real situation as the outbreak happened in the asmat communities which still had a semi nomadic way of life and collected food from nature and the government had provided emergency response on palm oil indonesia had taken policies to ensure a good business governance in the palm oil industry national commission on human rights of indonesia speaking in a video statement

rights audits of the national budget ukraine speaking as a concerned country said that it appreciated the opportunity to engage in the dialogue with the independent expert on his findings however ukraine regretted that the independent expert had left out many of the comments and observations made by ukrainian authorities in the report given the fact that the report dealt with ukraine it should have contained references to the united nations general assembly resolution 73 263 on the situation of human rights in the autonomous republic of crimea and the city of sevastopol ukraine ukraine noted that given the temporary occupation by the russian federation of this integral part of ukraine russia bore full responsibility for the respect for and protection of human rights in these

reforms aimed at strengthening democracy and the rule of law ensuring economic prosperity modernisation and well being of all citizens ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights speaking in a

there were five crossing points into donbas and every month almost a million citizens risked their lives to pass through attempting to receive social security and pensions the occupation of the eastern part had seriously damaged the country recommendations from the report on the need to plan policies for economic reform were welcomed those feeling the impact the most were low income families

better international governance across the world s seas and oceans to keep them clean safe and secure and was committed to fighting illegal unregulated and unreported fishing worldwide the european union asked what incentives would the independent expert envisage companies could give in order to further promote accountability initiatives and what measures could states improve in this regard

the fisheries sector pakistan noted that it had always been an active advocate of the abolition of all forms of slavery holy see noted that economic policies should always strive to be at the service of the full realization of human rights and inclusive development foreign debt was noted as being indicative of the lack of justice in the flow of capital in the world sudan issued an invitation to the independent expert on foreign debt and appreciated his efforts debt was hindering economic security as the report outlined and heavily indebted countries spent large parts of their income to repay former debts india noted that the report outlined the essential role that fish workers had in food security bringing out their concerns india produced 6 per cent of global fish production and the fish sector was a large employer and income generator for large sections of the population brazil considered that the development of guiding principles for human rights by its very nature was a task demanding comprehensive intergovernmental negotiations brazil was committed to modernizing the pension system raising employment levels and streamlining regulations palestine was disappointed that the report failed to recognize problems that fisher folk were facing in palestine due to the israeli occupation and blockade there were 361 documented incidents committed by the israeli navy including fisher folk killed and boats confiscated all leading to the collapse of the fishing sector tunisia welcomed the attempts of the report to spell out economic limits posed by foreign debt

said it would present a resolution on the right to food at this session cuba commended the work of the independent expert in drafting the guiding principles jordan stressed that its laws provided all labour rights and protections to agricultural workers while tax reform aimed to support low income workers and minimum wage had been raised by 15 per cent iraq stressed the need to place human beings at the heart of economic policies and that was why its national development plan aimed to adopt policies for human rights and human dignity water was iraq s prime resource and it fully understood the need to protect the rights of fishery workers djibouti remarked that its large fishing potential was not adequately exploited as yet and asked the special rapporteur to comment on the blue growth initiative by the food and agriculture organization russia stressed that the impact of human rights policies on the situation in the crimean peninsula could only be seen in the context of the human rights situation in russia and not ukraine bolivia was struck that the legal framework contained in the report did not include the general assembly resolution on the rights of peasants which also included the protection for small scale fisher folk france agreed with the special rapporteur that working conditions and remuneration for fisher folk both on the sea and inland were often forgotten by public policies and raised concern that in some instances their situation even approached modern slavery azerbaijan supported the recommendations of the special rapporteur especially on the

rapporteur on the right to food and the independent expert on foreign debt and its effect on human rights hilal elver special rapporteur on the right to food responding to questions posed by the delegation from indonesia highlighted that cultural differences could not justify a state averting its obligation to ensure the right to food for all and emphasized that there should not be any discriminatory policies when it came to safeguard this right the special rapporteur noted with concern that the lack of access to food and malnutrition in the papua region had exacerbated the measles outbreak there regarding the use of the term indigenous people ms elver noted that self identification was one of the most important criteria to defining an indigenous community and highlighted the multicultural nature of indonesian society the special rapporteur called on the indonesian government to better protect the rights of indigenous peoples regarding the country s palm oil industry ms elver stressed that she had duly elevated the positive aspects of the palm oil programme however it was undeniable that the industrial expansion of palm oil had created numerous issues regarding the right to food the bad practices of palm oil plantations posed a considerable threat to the right to food in indonesia the special rapporteur recognized the efforts that the government had made in making palm oil more sustainable but noted that it was important to also point out shortcomings on this issue juan pablo bohoslavsky independent expert on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights responded to remarks made by ukraine saying he took all comments into consideration and said that the general assembly resolution that the delegation had referred to had been adopted in december 2018 and had therefore not been included in his report but similar previous resolutions had been incorporated in the report the issue of economic losses for ukraine as a result of the armed conflict had been considered and analysed in several paragraphs of the report in reference to comments by brazil mr bohoslavsky said that the text of the guiding principles in its paragraph

policies in order to enjoy better working conditions including giving good working opportunities to rohingya migrants china said that the international community should create an inductive environment for developing countries to assure their food security including by lifting trade restrictions over the past 40 years china had always prioritized its people as a basis for economic reforms to ensure that they could benefit from economic social and cultural development lesotho said that fisheries played an important role in providing food and income and it was important to link the sector with the wider development agenda and to acknowledge that food security in the fishery sector could only be achieved by social and political development fisheries were a priority sector in burkina faso which made an important contribution to the realization of the right to food and that was why the legal framework to protect the human rights of the workers in the fisheries had been strengthened greece was striving to overcome the obstacles of the global economic and financial crisis which had hit the country hard and stressed the importance of learning from policy failures and errors made in addressing the crisis which often led to the deepening rather than alleviation of the impact of the crisis on human rights jamaica a small island state vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change recognized the links between debts and low rates of growth and remained deeply concerned about lending policies of the international financial institutions that continued to use gross domestic product as a sole criterion turkey recognized that most fisheries workers worked in precarious conditions even though they made a major contribution to food security of societies and nations and that was why it was important for the international community states and consumers to take positive steps ecuador said that regrettably structural adjustment policies faulted the enjoyment of human rights especially

of attention to fisher folk out of the labour market while fisher folk were driven out of their land and water territories due to extractive industries and large scale infrastructure projects women s international league for peace and freedom supported the independent expert s call on ukraine to take concrete steps to ensure that the burden of the economic crisis did not fall on the most disenfranchised neoliberalism and the consequent austerity measures had been elevated to the status of law the laws of the free market but they were not iraqi development organization said that

concern that iran had denied access to the contents of its fishing contracts with other countries environmentalists and fisher folk in iran were very much concerned about the water life after trawling due to the lack of transparency from government organizations in iran the extent of this damage was not known concluding remarks hilal elver special rapporteur on the right to food thanked all countries for taking the matter of fisheries very seriously this meant that all had to move forward and assist 800 million people working in fisheries who were providing important food for all and yet were living in poverty she noted the very important contribution of the european union spain and france as they were dealing with similar issues accountability private sector role supply chain responsibility and transparency this was all important as consumers private sector non governmental organizations fishing sector and governments had to work together the fishing sector was also a variety partly the industrial sector and partly small fishing communities so there was tension between the two as there were different layers of power in decision making yet they were all employing fisher folk article 71 72 73 of the report looked at the role of the private sector and how to make the sector more attractive while working on the report she had had a good relation with the food and agricultural organization and the international labour organization and they had made good contributions there was homework to be done and they had to do it together the peasants declaration was a big success and many governments supported it on friday there would be a side event on the fisheries sector so everyone was invited bolivia had mentioned peasants rights and djibouti asked about the project of the food and agricultural organization on fisheries fisheries were important for elevating poverty sustainable development goal 14 on life under water was extremely important and would be assessed in her next report the remarks of palestine were important and it was important to look at what was happening in gaza as for venezuela the special rapporteur could not go anywhere if the government did not invite her several letters had been sent to venezuela but with no response it was under investigation but it was too complicated as there were two sides as in any conflict juan pablo bohoslavsky independent expert on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights thanked ukraine and sri lanka for their cooperation states and civil society organizations were also thanked for their support international financial institutions and bilateral donors had to ensure that their decisions did not impact recipient ability to protect their human rights obligations states whether acting alone or with international financial institutions should not compel borrowing states to satisfy their financial obligations under compromise international bilateral lenders when granting loans or giving policy advice concerning economic reform had an obligation to take into account human rights impact assessment conducting human rights impact assessment was not an easy job it required multidisciplinary approach talking with all stakeholders and political will however two decades ago when feasibility was discussed of an environmental impact assessment it was not believed this could be done and yet two years ago a number of good practices had been identified for use of the information media not an official record

washington dc february 28 2019 the u s economy fell short of the trump administration s 3 percent annual growth target in 2018 despite 1 5 trillion in tax cuts and a government spending blitz and economists say growth will only slow from here a better than expected performance in the fourth quarter pushed gross domestic product up 2 9 percent for the year just shy of the goal commerce department data showed on thursday president donald trump has touted the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his term and declared last july that his administration had accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions on the campaign trail trump boasted that he could boost annual economic growth to 4 percent a goal that analysts always said was unachievable we are moving back to a sustainable growth pace that we experienced during most of the obama years said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania with the tax cut impacts largely done with it is hard to see how growth can accelerate sharply gross domestic product increased at a 2 6 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter after advancing at a 3 4 percent pace in the july september period economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp rising at a 2 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter growth in 2018 was the strongest since 2015 and better than the 2 2 percent logged in 2017 the expansion will be the longest on record in july the stronger than expected fourth quarter performance which reflected solid consumer and business spending was despite many headwinds including financial market volatility and the united states trade war with china raising optimism that an anticipated slowdown this year would not be abrupt the fiscal stimulus is believed to have peaked sometime in the fourth quarter december economic data such as retail sales exports homebuilding and business spending on equipment weakened sharply in addition most manufacturing measures softened in january and february and motor vehicle demand has eased the labor market is also exhibiting signs of cooling with a report from the labor department on thursday showing the number of americans receiving unemployment benefits rising to a 10 month high in the week ended feb 16 the first quarter won t be this good said paul ashworth chief economist at capital economics in toronto as the stimulus fades and the lagged impact of past monetary tightening continues to feed through we expect gdp growth to slow to 2 2 percent this year slowing growth together with weakening global demand and uncertainty over britain s departure from the european union support the federal reserve s patient stance towards raising interest rates further this year fed chairman jerome powell reaffirmed the u s central bank s position in his testimonies before lawmakers on tuesday and wednesday inflation was largely muted in the fourth quarter dollar trimmed losses against a basket of currencies on the gdp data and was last trading little changed u s treasury prices fell while stocks on wall street were lower following weak earnings from a handful of companies solid consumer spending the fourth quarter gdp report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the government that ended on jan 25 which affected the collection and processing of economic data the commerce department said it could not quantify the full effects of the shutdown on fourth quarter gdp growth economists expect the longest shutdown in history will hurt growth in the first quarter growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity increased at a still strong 2 8 percent rate in the fourth quarter consumer spending grew at a robust 3 5 percent rate in the third quarter consumption continues to be underpinned by a strong labor market with inflation adjusted income at the disposal of households jumping at a 4 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter compared to a 2 6 percent pace in the prior period stocks fall for third day as investors dial down trade hopes a moderation in spending is however likely amid reports 2018 tax refunds have been smaller than in the previous years business spending on equipment accelerated in the fourth quarter from the prior period growing at a 6 7 percent rate after losing speed since the first quarter of 2018 the trade deficit widened further as a combination of the u s china trade dispute strong dollar and weakening global demand restrained export growth the trade tensions also led businesses to hoard imports the trade shortfall subtracted 0 22 percentage point from fourth quarter gdp growth after slicing off 2 percentage points in the july september period with consumer spending slowing some of the imports ended up in warehouses accelerating the pace of inventory accumulation while that offset some of the drag on gdp growth from the trade deficit the piling up of stock is bad news for first quarter growth inventories increased at a 97 1 billion rate in the fourth quarter after rising at an 89 8 billion pace in the july september quarter inventory investment added 0 13 percentage point to gdp growth last quarter after contributing 2 33 percentage points in the prior period there was a rapid buildup of inventories in the fourth quarter so inventories likely will be a headwind

by marshall auerback a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute extreme weather variations and increasingly dire scientific reports have spurred surprisingly robust policy proposals for a green new deal rather admirably the resolution sponsored by sen ed markey d ma and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny marks a significant break from the usual small ball incrementalist approach to politics adopted in d c reflecting the increasingly prevailing view that the next decade or two is make or break for planet earth the sheer scale of the ambitious proposal net zero greenhouse gas emissions clean air and water married to traditional bread and butter progressive issues such as a job guarantee and universal health care have led to two predictable lines of attack the first is that the program represents full on socialism a grab bag of the left s favorite policies with everything from universal health care to a job guarantee draped under the mantle of environmentalism as a recent new york times opinion piece explains the second issue is how we are going to pay for it given that the proposed green new deal resolution envisages costs that will run into the trillions to undertake this whole restructuring of the u s economy shorn of ideological rhetoric the answer to the second question is actually quite simple we pay for these specific proposals much as we do with any government initiative congress appropriates the funds and the government literally spends the money into existence the key point here is that when a government issues a currency that is not backed by any metal or pegged to another currency i e the currency is created via government order or fiat hence the term fiat currency then there is no reason why it should be constrained in its ability to finance its spending by issuing currency in the way it was say under a gold standard in which the supply of gold held by each nation literally controlled its capacity to spend by extension taxes don t actually fund the government so much as they constrain overall expenditures in the economy in essence government spending adds new money to the economy whereas the imposition of taxes takes some of that money out again the constant addition and subtraction of these spending and taxing activities is how fiscal policy actually works and the sequencing is actually the opposite of what is traditionally taught in most economics textbooks likewise as the monopoly issuer of the currency the u s government via the federal reserve establishes the rates at which we borrow not the market it therefore follows that a sovereign currency issuing government unlike a private company does not have market based costs of capital that set the opportunity cost of their activities this is important to remember when you hear politicians outlining how certain policy goals are somehow constrained by borrowing costs or a particular discount rate this is also why private sector concepts such as internal rates of return irr or return on equity roe are only relevant in macroeconomic policy terms to the extent that the appropriated capital is used as productively as possible to mitigate possible inflationary pressures as opposed to whether this spending ultimately generates a profit or loss for the government to put it another way even if the government s balance sheet is adversely affected by poorly conceived and executed policy choices these mistakes have no bearing on whether the united states as the currency issuer has the fiscal capacity to meet any future crisis in contrast to a private firm which can t afford to misuse its finite capital resources lest cumulative losses drive it out of business as such costs and benefits must be measured largely in social terms rather than financial terms even as we acknowledge that the damage to gdp from the negative effects of climate change can be substantial note that although there is no financial constraint on the ability of a sovereign nation to deficit spend this does notmean that there are no real resource constraints on government spending this is the real concern that should guide policy not financial constraints if government spending pushes the economy beyond full capacity inflation will result a government can create all of the currency it likes but there are finite supplies of natural resources labor and other productive assets that form the backbone of an economy put another way money is not scarce but real resources can be so if government spending does not add to the economy s productive capacity then excessive expenditures will almost certainly become inflationary and that does represent a legitimate constraint that is why the main focus of the green new deal should be on how the money is spent rather than how the program is to be funded so in assessing how appropriated funds under a green new deal are spent the decarbonization of the u s economy must be constructed with a view toward other broad social goals which is why the markey ocasio cortez resolution incorporates so many additional features that at first glance do not deal solely with environmental issues a complaint recently made by speaker nancy pelosi a job guarantee for example must be a germane consideration in contemplating a substantial reduction and ultimately a full on elimination of the fossil fuels industry this not only means the hundreds of thousands of workers actually involved in the extraction production and distribution of oil gas coal etc but also the administrative and support jobs connected to these industries and the communities adversely impacted by the resultant job losses to give some idea of the scale of potential jobs at risk here a recent u s energy and employment report from 2017 estimates that there are about 2 3 million jobs in transmission distribution and storage with approximately 982 000 working in retail trade gasoline stations and fuel dealers and another 830 000 working across utilities and construction it is virtually impossible to contemplate the implementation of a green new deal if it is not accompanied holistically by policies that address the potential job disruption we don t want to have this debate framed yet again within the sterile paradigm of jobs vs environment which is a political non starter the canadian labor congress among others has enumerated a number of possible jobs to which the displaced workers could transition these jobs would include the retrofitting of buildings for energy conservation the retraining of workers to become energy auditors developing renewable energy sources promoting sustainable transport systems supporting community based sustainable industries community revitalization projects moving towards a complete waste recycling program and creating a publicly owned infrastructure that will manage in the public good there s no question that a properly revived manufacturing sector would also lead to a revived working and middle class because as the economist seymour melman explained high skill manufacturing leads to a process of economic growth that gives workers more power economically and within the firm even with mechanization and automation to be sure historically manufacturing has often been associated with dirty industries according to jon rynn a fellow at the cuny institute of urban systems emissions from manufacturing account for about 28 percent of greenhouse gas emissions once the electrical system is renewable however a substantial amount of these emissions is eliminated because almost all industrial machinery uses electricity so if the electricity is clean manufacturing can expand without worsening the climate problem needless to say this will require significant investments in energy efficiency alongside rapid decarbonization of power sources for as much of the economy as possible the broader question of inequality must also be tackled we live in a world where things are interdependent hence the whole concept of a just transition to an environmentally sustainable economy can only be adequately addressed when it is wrapped in a broader set of policies designed to help most americans which raises distributional questions that are part of the broader problem of today s highly unequal economy as the economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman have documented tax data in the united states illustrates that top 0 1 percent now hold 22 percent of the total wealth in the united states the same amount as the bottom 90 percent this takes us back to levels of economic distribution that existed more than 100 years ago when we barely had cars unions were virtually non existent and social welfare provision was minuscule simply believing that creating a whole bunch of clean tech jobs in and of itself will resolve this problem is disingenuous which is why the markey ocasio cortez resolution specifically addresses the broader issue of economic inequality failure to address the inequality question exacerbates the inflationary problem because when increasing amounts of gdp are directed toward those with the highest savings propensities i e the 1 percent it means that the economy doesn t grow as efficiently this matters when we are addressing a genuine national emergency such as climate change as opposed to the faux national emergency related to trump s southern border wall the scale of the spending shouldn t scare people at 2 trillion a year that s around 10 percent of a 20 trillion economy put another way the american government has spent greater sums in its afghanistan and iraq wars with no lasting productive benefit accruing to the u s economy to say nothing of the social costs and global environmental degradation by way of comparison as jon rynn writes the federal government paid for most of the machinery used to create the military equipment during world war ii and the corporations bought the factories for pennies on the dollar after the war ended to put it another way the federal government did not record a profit on the sale of these assets but the return came in the form of much of the industrial machinery that was the basis for the shared prosperity of the post wwii boom a period of unparalleled sharedprosperity emphasis added for the united states we have to make choices but the idea that we can t make the right choices based on funding concerns is ridiculous however the policy goal embodied in the green new deal must be part of a broader policy framework much as franklin delano roosevelt ultimately conceived of his economic bill of rights which featured a government funded health care provision as an extension of the original new deal after all the green new deal is as much about enhancing human capital that is increasing the wealth generating capability of people as it is about physical capital the machinery and systems that are physical in nature speaking about one without the other is as misconceived as speaking about a tree outside the context of the forest in which it grows remember that the next time someone dismisses the green new deal as a grab bag of policies designed to ensure a communist style capture of the commanding heights of the economy

from 27 february 1953 west germany benefited from the cancellation of most of its debt after this cancellation which made it possible for german economy to recover its position as economic leader on the european continent no other country has benefited from such favourable treatment it is essential to understand why and how this cancellation occurred in a nutshell west germany s major creditors wanted its economy to be revived for it to be a stable element in the struggle between nato countries and the eastern bloc if we compare the treatment granted to west germany after the war and what is imposed on developing countries or on greece today we cannot but notice a discrepancy in policies adopted by big powers if west germany could redeem its debt and rebuild its economy so soon after wwii it was thanks to the political will of its western creditors who had won the second world war i e the united states and their main western allies the united kingdom and france in october 1950 these three countries drafted a project in which the german federal government acknowledged debts incurred before and during the war they added a declaration to the effect that the three countries agree that the plan include appropriate satisfaction of demands towards germany so that its implementation does not jeopardize the financial situation of the german economy through unwanted repercussions nor has an excessive effect on its potential currency reserves the first three countries are convinced that the german federal government shares their view and that the restoration of german solvability includes an adequate solution for the german debt which takes germany s economic problems into account and makes sure that negotiations are fair to all participants now nazi germany had suspended external debt payments from 1933 and never resumed them which did not prevent it from receiving financial support and doing business with big private companies such as ford who financed the launch of the volkswagen the people s car imagined during the hitler regime general motors who owned the firm opel and general electric an associate of aeg german general electric and ibm accused of having supplied the technology that contributed to persecution suffering and genocide before and during world war ii germany s pre war debt amounted to 22 6 billion marks including interest its post war debt was estimated at dm 16 2 billion in the agreement signed in london on 27 february 1953 these sums were reduced to dm 7 5 billion and dm 7 billion respectively this amounts to a 62 6 reduction the sums mentioned above do not include debt linked to the policy of aggression and destruction that nazi germany conducted during the second world war nor the reparations that countries who fell victim to this aggression are entitled to those war debts were left aside adding yet another enormous gift to western germany the agreement further set up the possibility to suspend payments and renegotiate conditions in the event that a substantial change limiting the availability of resources should occur allied creditors granted the indebted german authorities and companies major concessions to make sure that the west german economy was effectively doing well and represented a stable key element among nato countries against the eastern bloc allied creditors granted the indebted german authorities and companies major concessions that far exceeded debt relief major german industrial corporations such as aeg siemens ig farben agfa basf bayer and hoechst krupp volkswagen bmw opel mercedes benz and also top finance companies such as deutsche bank commerzbank and the insurance company allianz were protected and reinforced despite the fact that they had played a leading role in supporting the nazi regime and were accomplices in the genocide of the jewish and romani peoples the power of big german capital came out of wwii unscathed thanks to the support of the major western powers as regards the problem of the debt that could have been demanded of germany the allies took the position that the country s economy had to be able to pay everything back while maintaining a high level of growth and improving the living standards of its population for germany to be able to pay back without getting poorer it needed to benefit from debt cancellation on a large scale but that would not be enough as history showed the country needed to regain considerable room for manoeuvre and autonomy to achieve this creditors accepted first that germany should repay a large part of its debts in its national currency the mark and only marginally in strong currencies such as dollars swiss francs pounds sterling second while in the early 1950s the country still had a negative trade balance importing more than it exported they agreed that germany should reduce importations it could manufacture at home those goods that were formerly imported in allowing germany to replace imports by home manufactured goods creditors agreed to reduce their own exports to this country as it happened for the years 1950 1 41 of german imports came from britain france and the united states if we add the share of imports coming from other creditor countries that participated in the conference belgium netherlands sweden and switzerland the total amount reached 66 third creditors allowed germany to sells its products abroad and even supported such exports so as to restore a positive trade balance these elements are all present in the aforementioned agreement the payment capacity of germany s private and public debtors does not signify only the capacity to regularly meet payment deadlines in dm without triggering an inflation process but also that the country s economy could cover its debts without upsetting its current balance of payments to determine germany s payment capacity we have to envisage a number of issues namely 1 germany s future productive capacity with special consideration for the production of export commodities and of import substitution 2 the possibility for germany to sell german goods abroad 3 probable future trade conditions 4 economic and tax measures that might be required to insure a surplus in exports moreover in case of dispute with creditors german courts were declared competent it was said explicitly that in some cases german courts may refuse to enforce a decision of a foreign court or of an arbitral body for instance when the enforcement of the decision would be contrary to public policy agreement on german external debts article 17 4 the debt service depended on how much the german economy could afford to pay another significant aspect was that the debt service depended on how much the german economy could afford to pay taking the country s reconstruction and the export revenues into account the debt service export revenue ratio was not to exceed 5 this meant that west germany was not to use more than one twentieth of its export revenues to pay its debt in fact it never used more than 4 2 except once in 1959 in any case since a large portion of the german debts were paid in deutsche marks the german central bank could issue money or in other words monetize the debt another exceptional measure was that interest rates were substantially reduced between 0 and 5 a benefit of huge economic value was granted by western powers to west germany article 5 of the london agreement postpones the payment of war debts and reparations wwi and wwii owed by the federal republic of germany to attacked occupied or annexed countries and to their citizens finally we have to consider the dollar grants the united states made to west germany usd 1 173 7 million as part of the marshall plan from 3 april 1948 to 30 june 1952 i e about usd 12 5 billion at today s value 2019 with at least 200 million added from 1954 to 1961 about usd 2 billion in 2019 mainly via usaid thanks to such exceptional conditions the west german economy was able to recover very fast and eventually absorbed east germany in the early 1990s it is now by far the strongest economy in europe some elements towards a comparison it is enlightening to compare the way post war west germany was treated with the treatment of developing countries although bruised by war germany was economically stronger than most developing countries today yet it received in 1953 what is currently denied to developing countries proportion of export revenues devoted to paying back the debt germany was allowed not to spend more than 5 of its export revenues to pay back its debt in 2017 developing countries had to spend an average of 14 of their export revenues on debt repayment in 2017 developing countries had to spend an average of 14 of their export revenues on debt repayment for countries in latin america and the caribbean this figure reached 23 5 there follow some examples of countries including developing countries and peripheral european economies in 2017 the figure reached 13 for angola 36 for brazil 15 for bosnia 21 for bulgaria 41 6 for colombia 17 for the republic of côte d ivoire 21 for ethiopia 28 for guatemala 34 for indonesia 70 for lebanon 14 for mexico 20 for nicaragua 22 8 for pakistan 21 for peru 22 for rumania and serbia 17 for tunisia and 40 for turkey interest rates on external debt as stipulated in the 1953 agreement about germany s debt the interest rate was between 0 and 5 by contrast the interest rates to be paid by developing countries were much higher a large majority of agreements had rates that could be increased between 1980 and 2000 for the developing countries as a whole the average interest rate oscillated between 4 8 and 9 1 between 5 7 and 11 4 in the case of latin america and the caribbean and as much as 11 9 in the case of brazil between 1980 and 2004 then interest rates dipped to a historic low during the period 2004 2015 however the situation has been worsening since 2016 2017 as the rising interest rate fixed by the fed the fed s prime rate went from 0 25 in 2015 to 2 25 in november 2018 and donald trump s generous tax breaks to major united states companies are drawing capital back to the usa at the same time the prices of raw materials are showing a tendency to fall thus reducing the revenues of developing countries that export primary commodities this makes it even more difficult for them to repay their debts as payments are principally made in dollars or other hard currencies in 2018 a new debt crisis hit countries such as argentina venezuela turkey indonesia nigeria and mozambique in 2019 more and more developing countries have to accept interest rates of over 7 up to as much as 10 if they wish to borrow currency in which the external debt had to be paid germany was allowed to use its national currency to repay part of its debt no developing countries can do the same except in exceptional cases for ludicrously small sums all major indebted countries must use strong currencies dollars euros yens swiss francs pounds sterling possibility of revising the agreement in the case of germany the london debt agreement set up the possibility to suspend payments and renegotiate conditions in the event that a substantial change should curtail available resources creditors make sure that loan agreements with developing countries do not include such a possibility worse still if a developing country should run into difficulty creditors are allowed to demand advance payment of sums due in the future policy of import substitution the london debt agreement stipulated that germany could manufacture commodities it used to import by contrast the wb the imf and the major powers prohibit developing countries from manufacturing anything they can import cash grants in strong currencies although it was largely responsible for the second world war germany received significant grants in strong currencies as part of the marshall plan and beyond while the rich countries have promised developing countries assistance and cooperation the latter merely receive a trickle by way of currency grants whereas they collectively pay back some more than usd 500 bn a year they receive less than usd 100 bn undoubtedly the refusal to grant indebted developing countries the same kind of concessions as were made to germany indicates that creditors do not really want these countries to get rid of their debt creditors consider that it is in their better interest to maintain developing countries in a permanent state of indebtedness so as to draw maximum revenues in the form of debt reimbursement but also to enforce policies that serve their interests and to make sure that they remain loyal partners within the international institutions germany 1953 greece 2010 2019 if we attempt a comparison between the way greece is treated today and the way germany was treated after the second world war the differences are obvious and the injustice is flagrant here is a non exhaustive list 1 between 2010 and 2019 debt as a percentage of greek gdp has increased constantly rising from about 110 to 180 2 social and economic conditions associated with interference from the troika since 2010 in no way support greek economic recovery whereas germany benefited from measures that made a huge contribution to restoring its economy greece s gdp fell by about 30 between 2010 and 2016 as a result of the memoranda that were imposed by comparison west germany s gdp grew exponentially between 1953 and 1960 3 greece must privatize its assets to foreign investors whereas germany was prompted to control key economic sectors along with a fast expanding public sector and large private companies that remained under the strategic control of german capital 4 greece s bilateral debts to countries that participated in the rescue plan imposed by the troika have not been reduced whereas germany s bilateral debts starting with those towards countries that had been attacked invaded or annexed by the third reich were reduced by 60 or more 5 greece must pay in euros while its trade balance with european partners particularly germany and france is negative whereas germany paid most of its debts with the strongly devalued deutsche mark the fact that germany was able to repay a large part of its debt in deutsche marks facilitated the sale of its merchandize abroad to take the example of germany s biggest debts to belgium and france after wwii germany was authorized to repay them in deutsche marks now what else could belgium and france do with those deutsche marks but buy products made in germany which naturally contributed to rebuilding germany s capacity as a great exporter 6 the greek central bank is not allowed to lend money to the greek government while the german central bank the bundesbank did lend to the west german government and printed money though moderately 7 germany was allowed not to use more than 5 of its export revenues to pay its debt while no limit has been set for greece 8 the new securities on greek debt that since 2012 have replaced the previous set of securities owned by the banks are no longer within the jurisdiction of greek courts but of courts in luxembourg and the united kingdom and we know how sympathetic they are to private creditors while the german courts were declared competent 9 in terms in paying external debt german courts could refuse to enforce decisions of foreign courts or arbitration bodies when they were contrary to public security in greece the troika will not allow greek courts to invoke public security to suspend payments now as it would happen both the huge social protests and the rise of neo nazi groups are the direct outcome of measures imposed by the troika and by the country s repayment of debts whatever the outcry in brussels the imf and the financial markets the greek government could legitimately invoke the state of necessity and public security to suspend payment of debts and cancel the antisocial measures imposed by the troika 10 in the case of germany the london agreement provided for suspension of payments while conditions were renegotiated in the eventuality of a substantial change that reduced available resources nothing similar is mentioned in the case of greece 11 the agreement on the german external debt explicitly mentioned that the country could produce goods it formerly imported so as to achieve a trade surplus and support local producers but the philosophy behind the agreements forced upon greece and eu rules prohibit such support whether in farming manufacturing or services since this would contravene fair competition with other eu countries greece s main trading partners we could add that after the second world war germany received substantial grants notably as mentioned above through the marshall plan the lies about aid to greece hans werner sinn one of the most influential economists in germany and an advisor to angela merkel s government did not hesitate to lie in a 2012 interview when he stated that greece has already received 460 billion euros through various mechanisms the aid already given to greece represents the equivalent of 214 of its gdp or nearly ten times more than what germany received under the marshall plan berlin has provided nearly one fourth of the aid given to greece 115 billion euros which represents at least ten marshall plans or two and a half times the london agreement his calculation is entirely wrong greece has received no such financing and what it has received cannot seriously be considered as aid quite the reverse hans werner sinn scandalously equates the germany of the end of nazi instigated world war ii and the greece of the 2000s in addition he fails to mention the sums rightly claimed from germany by greece in reparation for the damages caused by the nazi occupation as well as the loan nazi germany forced greece to give it according to the greek parliamentary committee that explored these issues in 2015 germany s debt to greece came to over 270 billion as we learn on the website a l encontre on the basis of research by karl heinz roth a historian of the pillage of europe when it was occupied by nazi germany germany only paid greece one sixtieth 1 67 of the reparations owed to make up for the massive destruction caused by the occupation from1941 to 1944 see also my interview in the french weekly marianne 1 the so called aid plans serve the interests of private banks not those of the greek people the aid plans that have been set up since 2010 have first of all served the interests of private banks in the richest countries in the eurozone mainly the big german and french banks which had considerably increased their loans to both the private sector and public authorities in greece in the 2000s the loans granted to greece by the troika since 2010 have been used to pay back private western banks and have enabled them to minimize their losses as they withdrew from greece 2 the loans granted to greece are profitable outside greece beyond the greek borders the loans granted to greece under the aegis of the troika are remunerated the different countries participating in these loans are making money when the first loan of 110 billion was agreed christine lagarde who was the french finance minister at the time announced that france was lending to greece at 5 while at the same time borrowing at a much lower rate the situation was so scandalous a high interest rate was also applied to ireland from november 2010 and to portugal from may 2011 that the lending governments and the european commission decided in july 2011 that the rate paid by greece must be reduced in the face of greek government protests and the deep popular discontent expressed by strong social mobilizations in greece the lending countries finally agreed to give the country a discount on the income they received from athens on condition that the difference still be used for debt repayments however it should be noted that revenues were refunded at a trickle and most would never be repaid pascal franchet and anouk renaud of the cadtm calculated the profits france made from the so called bail out of greece they reckoned that greece was defrauded of over 3 billion see sauvetage de la grèce une arnaque à plus de 3 milliards d euros for my part i have denounced the judicially odious profits made by the ecb on the back of the greek people see ecb s odious profits on the backs of the greek people 3 the eurozone crisis reduces the cost of debt for germany and the other strong countries that s not the end of the story the dominant eurozone countries profit from the miseries of the periphery greece ireland portugal spain and those countries of the former eastern bloc which are now members of the eu the aggravation of the eurozone crisis due to policies applied by its leaders and not to external phenomena results in capital movements from the periphery towards the centre france germany austria belgium finland luxembourg and the netherlands profit from it in the form of a great reduction in the cost of financing their debts on the 1 january 2010 before the greek and eurozone crises the cost to germany of emitting ten year bonds was 3 4 on the 23 may 2012 the cost had fallen to 1 4 a reduction of 60 in the cost of financing according to the french financial daily les échos a rough calculation shows that the savings on this reduced interest rate amount to 63 billion this is to be compared to the loan of 15 billion of the 110 billion promised by the group of creditors that was effectively lent with interest see above by germany to greece between may 2010 and december 2011 in the context of the first troika aid plan we have mentioned the 6 and 10 year rate for german borrowing if we take the two year rate germany issued bonds for this period on the 23 may 2012 at zero interest at the beginning of the year germany borrowed 3 9 billion at negative interest rates the belgian daily le soir noted on 23 may 2012 investors will receive in six months time a slightly reduced repayment on their loan less 0 0112 if there happened to be a grain of truth in the flow of lies concerning greece spain or portugal we should read that greece enables germany and other strong eurozone countries to make considerable savings to the list of advantages reaped by germany and the other strong european union countries should be added the following elements 4 privatization programmes to the advantage of the strong countries private enterprises the austerity policies imposed on greece contain vast programmes of privatization the big groups particularly french and german have been able to take advantage of the give away prices practised on the sale of public property 5 the sacrifices imposed on the workers enable the containment of protest movements in countries of the centre the social defeats inflicted on greek workers and also on irish portuguese and spanish and more put the austrian belgian dutch french german and other workers on the defensive union organizers are dubious about confrontation they wonder how they can argue for pay increases if in a country like greece a eurozone member wages are being reduced by 20 or more among the north european unions notably in finland we note with consternation that some good is seen in the tscg treaty on stability coordination and governance and austerity policies as they are perceived as reinforcing good state budget management an agreement of the type made in london in 1953 can only be reached after a battle in october 2014 i was interviewed by a major greek daily the editors journal www efsyn gr about the 1953 london agreement the journalist asked me the following question alexis tsipras has called for an international conference for the abolition of the debt of the southern european countries that are affected by the crisis similar to what was done for germany in 1953 when 22 countries including greece cancelled a large part of the german debt is this a realistic possibility today this was my reply this is a legitimate demand unlike nazi germany greece has not caused any conflict on european soil the greek people can strongly insist that the greek debt is illegal or illegitimate and should be cancelled just as the german debt was in 1953 however i don t think that syriza and other european political forces can convince the european institutions to get together around a table to do the same as was done for germany in 1953 although this request is legitimate it will not be possible to bring the governments of the main european economies and the eu institutions to the table on this agenda the experience of the last ten years has shown that unilateral sovereign acts can get results the creditors that reclaim the payment of an illegitimate debt and impose violent measures that attack fundamental human rights including economic and social rights must be refused i think that greece has strong arguments for forming a government that would have popular support for working in this direction such a popular leftist government could establish a debt audit committee that would include a large popular democratic participation this audit committee would unilaterally suspend repayments and finally repudiate the part of the debt that it identifies as illegal and or odious as it turned out alexis tsipras chose to implement a different orientation which ended in disaster conclusion let us not delude ourselves the reasons for which the western powers treated west germany as they did after wwii are in no way relevant to the case of greece or other indebted countries in order to maintain their domination of indebted countries or at least the ability to impose policies in line with creditors interests the major powers and the international financial institutions have no intention of cancelling their debts and enabling true economic development the only realistic way of resolving the ongoing tragedy of debt and austerity would be for powerful social mobilization in indebted countries to give their governments the courage to confront their creditors by imposing unilateral debt cancellation carrying out citizens debt audits plays a

predictions of doom for the us dollar are not new and have so far come to nothing yet while it might not happen tomorrow the risk warnings are there says john stepek here s how to get your portfolio ready ever since the bretton woods agreement in 1944 the us dollar has been the acknowledged top dog of global currencies the reserve currency and for almost as long people have been predicting that it would be toppled from that position as yet of course it hasn t happened but with donald trump running the public finances as imprudently as he managed his own and his opponents talking about printing money to fund pet projects could it be different this time the case against the dollar there are at least two good reasons to fear for the durability of the us currency right now firstly absolutely no one with any power over the dollar has any obvious regard for preserving its value president donald trump is a spender not a saver fiscal hawks politicians who aspire to keep spending roughly in line with or below the tax take are often associated with the republican party but even in their own party they are a minority a package of tax cuts has seen america s deficit its annual overspend balloon under trump as a result the national debt already standing at around 22trn or more than 100 of gdp is set to race higher and as hedge fund billionaire ray dalio of bridgewater associates notes this is before you start talking about unfunded spending on entitlements such as healthcare and pensions the highest ever level for the us was around 119 seen in 1946 just after world war ii subscribe to moneyweek subscribe to moneyweek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely free get 6 issues free sign up to money morning don t miss the latest investment and

with our free twice daily newsletter sign up meanwhile trump s main political opposition the democratic party has no intention of being fiscally responsible either indeed the biggest policy idea firing up the american left right now is a green new deal which would be funded in accordance with the tenets of modern monetary theory mmt in other words it wants to spend a huge amount of money on revamping america s energy infrastructure and it would raise the money not through taxes or through borrowing but simply by getting the government to print it this is the basic idea behind mmt nicknamed magic money tree for obvious reasons finally despite trump s huge tax cutting splurge which should in theory at least stimulate the economy and therefore justify higher interest rates the federal reserve the us central bank and thus de facto guardian of the currency s purchasing power has apparently capitulated to stockmarkets and abandoned the idea of raising interest rates anyfurther this year indeed the fed s next move is to work out when it will end the current quantitative tightening qt the process of reversing quantitative easing programme fed chairman jerome powell has repeatedly warned that the us needs to deal with its debt but unless he forces the issue by jacking up interest rates politicians are not going to pay any attention why bother cutting spending or raising taxes if you can either print the money or get the fed to do it and in any case the fed itself now looks as though it is more worried about recession and more keen to loosen monetary policy than to tighten it which all else being equal is not good news for the dollar either democrats want to print money to spend on green energy as for the other good reason to question the dollar s continued reign one aspect of being the reserve currency is that to use a computer metaphor the dollar effectively acts as the operating system for global finance and trade it s microsoft windows for money if you like what has become increasingly clear in recent years is that the us is both able and willing to lock countries and individuals out of this operating system should it see the need for example as luke gromen of the forest for the trees newsletter points out to real vision s grant williams 2012 was a real watershed moment on this front the us using economic sanctions effectively locked iran out of the global financial system hammering the iranian rial and helping to drive inflation higher russia has also been the target of similar sanctions the problem argues gromen is that it was a penny wise pound foolish decision by the us because it s a weapon you can only use once they did it to iran and they caught russia s attention they caught china s attention anyone else in the world who figured they might be on the wrong side of the us any time in the next five ten years had to start thinking about the fact that the us could within two weeks completely choke out your economy starve your people no one wants to be stuck with an unreliable operating system and it s certainly true that some countries appear to have stepped up their hunt for an alternative to the dollar for example russia sold off almost all of its us government debt holdings last year either in retaliation against us sanctions on prominent businessmen politicians and companies or more likely due to concerns that its dollar assets would become untradeable the case for the dollar against all this of course there are a huge number of factors that remain in the dollar s favour as financial historian and analyst russell napier points out the dollar is backed by what is still the world s most powerful economy safeguarded by strong institutions that underpin property rights and democracy not to mention the world s most powerful military as credit rating agency moody s puts it the transparency of the us financial markets as well as the stability and predictability of us monetary policy reinforces the safe haven legacy that the us dollar holds nowhere else in the world offers that kind of security which is of course one reason why many in the us currently appear to believe that it should be possible for the us government to print as much money as it wants without triggering any sort of upset in global markets and this in short is the problem yes the dollar has its issues particularly right now howard marks the billionaire distressed debt investor and contrarian highlighted the national debt in a conversation with bloomberg warning that there is probably such a thing as too much but at the same time if you want to challenge the dollar as the operating system for global finance then you have to have something to replace it with and options are thin on the ground the second most used currency in the world right now is the euro and indeed one driving force behind the euro s creation was to build a trade bloc that could rival the us in terms of economic if not military clout however the problems with the euro are extremely clear to all but the most blinkered europhile question marks still hang over whether it can survive in the long run and if so what will be the nature of the institutions backing it the idea of a digital currency displacing the dollar is intriguing but unlikely china s currency the yuan is the other obvious candidate given that china is the rising superpower just as the uk saw sterling loseits crown to the us but china is also a long wayfrom having the institutions and financial andpolitical freedoms required to make the yuan aviable reserve currency the idea that cryptocurrency might play some role in the future financial system is more intriguing since the big bitcoin crash of 2018 much of the heat has come out of the digital currency market the current fad is for stablecoins cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another widely accepted asset such as the us dollar or perhaps even gold the idea that stablecoins might eventually become the fast reliable medium of exchange that bitcoin has so far failed to be is interesting but the prospects of such an early stage technology replacing the world s reserve currency any time in the near future seems even less likely than the euro or the yuan taking the top spot what could start the dollar s decline in the immediate term several analysts note that the current trade dispute between the us and china could pave the way for some sort of deal on currencies that kick starts the slow process of the yuan becoming a reserve currency itself some argue that a plaza accord style deal named after a 1985 deal to allow the us dollar to weaken against the japanese yen might be forthcoming whereby the chinese agree to keep the yuan relatively stable against the us dollar in return for no further sanctions gromen argues that if we get a comprehensive trade deal with a strong and fairly obvious foreign exchange component that weakens the dollar institutionally against the yuan and probably other currencies then i think the outlook is quite weak for the dollar louis vincent gave of gavekal agrees that a plaza lite accord of this sort would be a game changer for markets more on what it would mean for investments in the box on page 26 in the longer run it s not the revaluation of the yuan that concerns the bears as far as dalio and others who worry about the debt are concerned the big risk is that the us will be unable to sell us treasuries at an interest rate it can afford to pay we have the privileged position of being able to borrow in our own currency because we have the world s leading reserve currency we are risking that by borrowing too much domestic buyers fears dalio won t have the capacity to soak up the future supply and foreign buyers won t want to thus the fed will have to step in and use printed money to buy up government debt explicitly monetising the deficit that could panic investors dalio argues that you could easily have a 30 depreciation in the dollar through that period the question is what could trigger that sort of reaction the idea that deficits don t matter has gradually taken hold in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis when the crisis first hit huge sovereign debt piles partly the result of countries bailing out their banking systems were still viewed as something tobe feared it seemed only a matter of time beforethe bond vigilantes struck in many countries yet instead bond prices kept rising and yieldskept falling the fed is looking for an excuse to allow inflation to run hot this wasn t all down to central banks buying their own governments debt instead the main driver of sliding yields has been the deflationary backdrop when inflation is low and falling then bonds which offer a fixed income become increasingly appealing you ll be willing to pay more for a fixed payment when prices are rising slowly than when prices are rising fast as a result demand for bonds has been underpinned both by central banks and by high demand from buyers looking for assets that can protect them from the deflation bogeyman as that environment has continued for longer than anyone had expected many notably politicians have started to believe that inflation will never take off regardless of how much money is printed that strikes us as foolhardy it s worth noting that history suggests according to a pretty exhaustive study of past bank crises by economic historians carmen reinhart and ken rogoff that recoveries from bank crises take much longer than recoveries from normal recessions so there is no real justification for believing that it s different this time and indeed as charles gave of gavekal points out there are signs that the us may be entering a period of structural inflation as well as the tight labour market and evidence of rising wages gave notes that when the return on gold is outperforming the return on ten year us treasuries as it is now this tends to indicate that the us economy is transitioning to a different macro environment in this case from a deflationary environment to an inflationary one what if inflation makes a comeback the obvious question is won t the fed step in to prevent inflation from taking off that s certainly what was worrying the market last year yet the fed is now apparently looking at changes in the way it targets inflation to cut a long story short the fed is considering targeting a long term average inflation rate rather than the current specific 2 target however given that inflation has spent more time under the 2 target than above it in recent years this suggests that the fed may use the new framework assuming it changes as an excuse to allow inflation to run hot for some time what does that imply for one it suggests that bonds will no longer be structurally attractive if prices are rising at an ever increasing rate the last thing you want to own is a fixed income asset this suggests that us government bond prices would need to fall potentially quite hard to tempt investors that could spark the sort of buyers strike that might force the fed to monetise the deficit and it would have many other implications too as we examine below how to prepare for a declining dollar the dollar could take a very long time to come to lose its place as the world s most important currency and as we note above before it does we ll probably have to see inflation take off so if you are concerned about the dollar s demise or at least its being dislodged from its perch then prepare your portfolio for inflation first the most obvious asset to invest in if you have concerns about the state of the financial system is gold central banks have been loading up on the yellow metal at a rate that we haven t seen since president richard nixon finally took the us dollar off the gold standard once and for all in 1971 up until then the us dollar had been convertible to gold at a fixed rate of 35 an ounce but fears about heavy spending on the war in vietnam and its impact on america s balance sheet meant that foreign governments were increasingly cashing in their dollars for gold until nixon put a stop to it according to the world gold council central banks in all added more than 650 tonnes to their official gold reserves in 2018 if you don t own any gold you should probably follow them you can buy physical gold in many ways for example sharps pixley sells bullion both online and from its showroom in london while bullionvault offers a straightforward way to buy gold silver or other precious metals online if you re not overly concerned about being able to hold the gold in your hand you can simply buy an exchange traded fund etf one popular london listed option is the etf securities physical gold lse phau another side effect of a more inflationary world is that long duration assets those that have benefited the most from low and falling interest rates will no longer be in vogue this covers everything from long dated bonds to jam tomorrow growth stocks so any shift to a more inflationary environment could be the long awaited trigger for value stocks to finally make a comeback you could look at a contrarian orientated value investment trust such as temple bar lse tmpl as a way to position yourself for any such turnaround meanwhile if the us and china do agree to china revaluing the yuan over a sustained period says louis vincent gave then this would be bullish for asian currencies and bonds as suddenly they would lack natural sellers with a rise in asian currencies and an across the board drop in regional interest rates asian consumers would secure a huge purchasing power fillip asian consumer stocks would surely rocket across the pacific ocean such an outcome would be bad news for us consumers whose purchasing power would diminish there are plenty ofdecent investment trusts to consider if you want to invest in asia several of which we covered in our recent story on the region for smaller companies take a look at the scottish oriental smaller companies trust lse sst currently trading at a discount to net asset value the value of the underlying portfolio of shares of around 12 or the aberdeen standard asia focus lse aas for example on a discount of around 11 or for something more focused on larger caps the schroder asia pacific fund lse sdp which is currently on a discount

to see the environment improve as regulations are clarified and financially weaker and fraudulent firms are gradually weeded out while our top line continued to decrease significantly on a year over year basis our business has begun improving on a sequential basis following the cost cutting initiatives we put in place during the quarter and re shifting our focus from loan transfer services back to new loan products as the market rebuilds our net loss narrowed sequentially as a result recent statistics show that the loan balance for the entire sector decreased 36 as of december 31 2018 when compared with a year ago our loan balance however grew 21 year over year i believe this demonstrates how the strategy we implemented in response to market turbulence over the past two quarters has

that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure centerpoint energy s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share respectively the impact of zens and related securities and mark to market gains or losses resulting from the company s energy

tricky rebalancing act the chinese consumer is the single most important thing in the world economy says jim o neill a former goldman sachs chief economist the next 40 years of global growth might be about the chinese consumer it is very unlikely that any other country could step in to drive global consumption with its housing and industrial sectors mired by overcapacity greater production of consumer goods and services should provide a more sustainable basis for economic growth in china but with investment in new production the cornerstone of the country s development economists expect a more consumption driven economy to be a slower growing one indeed the shift has coincided with a slowdown in chinese growth which last year fell to its lowest rate 6 6 per cent since 1990 beijing faces a tricky rebalancing act therefore as it tries to avoid a hard landing for the economy investment remains critical to growth and slowing it too rapidly could deflate consumption but if consumption remains at its current level still low by international standards then wasted investment and lack of demand will drag down the economy anyway as chinese households become more affluent more of their spending goes on services than goods grainne quinlan advertisement investment is still driving demand that s what creates jobs says keyu jin a professor at the london school of economics you can see clearly that as soon as investment slows down the economy slows down as a recent rattling of global stocks on fears of a slowdown in china showed the challenge reverberates beyond the country to the fortunes of consumer goods groups from carmakers to technology and pharmaceutical companies but beijing could tolerate a short term slowdown for the sake of longer term growth analysts say changing china s growth model or economic rebalancing for short was never aimed at boosting gdp growth but at making growth more sustainable says pieter bottelier of the carnegie endowment s international economics programme domestic demand is key jiang s annual household income of about 90 000 yuan 19 000 is a reminder that most chinese consumers remain poor by developed world standards it puts the family above the median chinese income of 68 000 yuan according to the china household finance survey but at us23 000 32 000 in purchasing power parity terms the figure is well below the us median of us31 000 apple s revenue warning in january prompted by slowing sales in china was a reminder of just how important the country s consumers are to the profits of multinational groups ng han guan advertisement however chinese household income has grown at a much faster pace than in the developed world in recent years median individual disposable income grew more than 9 per cent annually between 2011 and 2017 according to chfs data this growth was aided by the accumulation of capital and technology which has made workers more productive but the rise in household income has outpaced growth over the same period underlying this are the changing employment dynamics which saw the share of labour compensation as a percentage of gdp rise from 46 per cent in 2007 to more than 60 per cent in 2016 by then china s labour pool had begun to decline while labour intensive service industries became the main source of economic output pushing up wages jiang and her husband also a teacher do not work in the private sector which accounts for most of the country s jobs but schools have increased pay and benefits such as healthcare in recent years and beijing hopes zhang and consumers like him pick up the baton of growth with global growth tepid and rising political resistance to trade imbalances china cannot look overseas for demand as it did before the financial crisis so has to look for it at home investment which surged in property and heavy industry sectors such as steel production after the financial crisis is becoming less efficient china needs to start making higher return investments those that successfully anticipate or create demand from the growing middle and upper classes according to analysts at gavekal dragonomics a consultancy the current level of rebalancing has already helped that process services accounted for more than half of fixed asset investment last year a record and as the rise of chinese consumer goods companies especially telecoms groups such as huawei and xiaomi has shown chinese companies are capable of hitting a high level of productivity based on domestic demand advertisement china doesn t need to rely on international trade to the extent its east asian neighbours did says nicholas lardy a fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington its domestic market is big enough that all the economies of scale can be gained through domestic sales consumer caution but just as china needs them most consumers are growing cautious vehicle sales in the world s largest car market fell for the first time since the 1990s last year while retail sales growth slipped to 8 per cent a 15 year low and the smartphone market is shrinking with the us china trade war creating uncertainty despite more emollient noises from the white house and a tightening of credit growth which has led to a curbing of corporate investment and increasing bankruptcies consumers appear to be cutting back on large discretionary purchases such as cars in wuhu the largest employers carmaker chery and anhui conch cement are both trimming investment government infrastructure projects such as the construction of a series of six bridges in the city are also slowing yet closer analysis suggests fears about falling consumption are exaggerated the reasons behind the drop in car sales are often sector specific factors such as tax cuts being reversed advertisement likewise retail sales offer an imperfect picture of household spending the figures include corporate and government purchases while as chinese households become more affluent more of their spending goes on services than goods zhang for instance says 15 per cent of the family s household income is spent on tourism their daughter s education is another big expense we expect consumption growth to ease further this year but to continue to outpace investment and be a key driver of economic growth says tianjie he an analyst at oxford economics in hong kong concerns about china s consumers are largely overdone the recent wobbles in consumer confidence reflect a fundamental fact about the economy growth in worker productivity comes mainly from investment undertaken by companies and local governments and last year fixed asset investment in china recorded its slowest growth since the 1990s while income growth fell below 7 per cent high house prices in theory the share of investment in gdp can fall without slowing growth as long as the investment becomes more efficient it is impossible to efficiently invest 40 per cent or more of gdp just too much gets wasted says lardy increasing consumer focused investment will help with efficiency as consumer focused firms tend to be more privately dominated chinese companies such as tencent and alibaba are investing billions in consumer infrastructure online and offline advertisement but lardy warns that if you continue to invest inefficiently and slow down the investment rate you are going to slow down your growth estimating that increases in gdp could slow to 4 per cent in the next few years if credit allocation does not improve in china that is why you shouldn t dial back the investment ratio quickly there is a danger that the growth in overall consumption could end up being stifled by rising inequality as of 2015 the top 10 per cent of chinese owned more than 65 per cent of household wealth with the bottom 50 per cent owning less than 10 per cent this is partly reflected in china s high household savings rate which peaked at 25 per cent of gdp in 2010 but has since dipped reducing it is essential to ensuring that the rebalancing is sustainable the imf recently warned about the shortfall between household income and consumption saying there was room for growth gdp per capita in ppp terms similar to brazil s consumption per capita in china is only comparable to nigeria the imf wrote in december if chinese households consumed comparably to brazilian households their consumption levels would be more than double economists agree that high house prices are a crucial factor keeping savings by chinese households at 37 per cent of income and putting a brake on consumer spending for years jiang and her husband paid into a scheme to fund a house purchase but buying a property in 2016 with a large downpayment enabled them to increase discretionary spending an expanded social safety net in china including a partial health insurance system and a larger population of pensioners who tend to draw down their savings have also boosted discretionary spending but they are fortunate towards the bottom end of the income scale households borrow heavily to afford housing china s household borrowing has risen to 49 per cent of gdp mostly due to an increase in mortgage debt advertisement made at home with chinese income taxes making up a negligible portion of government revenue and a long awaited property tax delayed most redistribution is happening within families rather than through the fiscal system jiang s daughter zhang siyuan has parents and grandparents willing to transfer some of their savings to a younger generation that is more likely to spend it china s generation z born after 1998 accounts for 15 per cent of all household spending in china compared with 4 per cent in britain and the us according to oc c strategy consultants a new generation of consumers who are low savers are beginning to enter the market says the lse s jin but this is taking time apple s revenue warning in january prompted by slowing sales in china was a reminder of just how important the country s consumers are to the profits of multinational groups gm sells more cars in china than it does in any other market and starbucks has more stores in the country than any other country except the us these companies carry out the vast majority of their production for chinese consumers in china itself meaning the benefits of these sales flow overseas only via remitted profits or higher equity values for the companies chinese consumer imports amounted to just us205 billion in 2015 according to the most recent world bank data or about 12 per cent of total imports and while 23 million passenger vehicles were sold in china last year fewer than 1 million were imported tourism is a notable exception with outbound spending reaching us258 billion in 2017 there are some goods that chinese consumers demand but which cannot be produced domestically at a lower cost or at equal quality most notable are luxury goods imports of dairy products from new zealand and avocado cherries and other fruits from latin america have surged but that does not detract from the fact that china has already become the production site for most consumer goods reducing the need for imports that contrasts with its investment which remains stubbornly reliant on imports of commodities the import intensity of chinese consumption a measure of the percentage of final household consumption directly due to imports is about 10 per cent says diana choyleva of consultancy enodo economics for investment that figure is closer to 20 per cent a consumer led recovery unlike the investment led revivals of the past will be a lesser growth engine for the rest of the world warns choyleva china will be producing more of the manufactured goods it will be consuming financial times

europe real estate plc which was a london stock exchange listed company that we externally managed through a wholly owned subsidiary on october 20 2017 we acquired kwe which is now a wholly owned subsidiary prior to the acquisition we owned approximately 24 and in accordance with u s gaap the results of kwe were consolidated in our financial statements adjusted ebitda represents net income before interest expense our share of interest expense included in income from investments in unconsolidated investments depreciation and amortization our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt and income taxes share based compensation expense for the company and ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests please also see the reconciliation to gaap in the company s supplemental financial information included in this release and also available at www kennedywilson com our management uses adjusted ebitda to analyze our business because it adjusts net income for items we believe do not accurately reflect the nature of our business going forward or that relate to non cash compensation expense or noncontrolling interests such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance additionally we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations however adjusted ebitda is not a recognized measurement under gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use adjusted ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use as it does not remove all non cash items such as acquisition related gains or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amount shown for adjusted ebitda also differs from the amount calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments adjusted fees refers to kennedy wilson s gross investment management property services and research fees adjusted to include kennedy wilson s share of fees eliminated in consolidation kennedy wilson s share of fees in unconsolidated service businesses and performance fees included in unconsolidated investments effective january 1 2018 we adopted new gaap guidance on revenue recognition and implemented a change in accounting principles related to performance allocations which resulted in us now accounting for performance allocations commonly referred to as performance fees or carried interest under the gaap guidance for equity method investments and presenting performance allocations as a component of income from unconsolidated investments our management uses adjusted fees to analyze our investment management and real estate services business because the measure removes required eliminations under gaap for properties in which the company provides services but also has an ownership interest these eliminations understate the economic value of the investment management property services and research fees and makes the company comparable to other real estate companies that provide investment management and real estate services but do not have an ownership interest in the properties they manage our management believes that adjusting gaap fees to reflect these amounts eliminated in consolidation presents a more holistic measure of the scope of our investment management and real estate services business adjusted net income represents net income before depreciation and amortization our share of

nor the level of capital expenditures tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties any of the enumerated items above could have a material effect on the performance of our properties also where specifically noted for properties purchased in 2018 the noi represents estimated year 1 noi from our original underwriting estimated year 1 noi for properties purchased in 2018 may not be indicative of the actual results for those properties estimated annual noi is not an indicator of the actual annual net operating income that the company will or expects to realize in any period please also see the definition of net operating income below the company does not provide a reconciliation for estimated annual noi to its most directly comparable forward looking gaap financial measure because it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate estimation of each of the component reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and or amount of various items that would impact estimated annual noi including for example gains on sales of depreciable real estate and other items that have not yet occurred and are out of the company s control for the same reasons the company is unable to meaningfully address the probable significance of the unavailable information and believes that providing a reconciliation for estimated annual noi would imply a degree of precision as to its forward looking net operating income that would be confusing or misleading to investors estimated forward yield on cost represents the company s estimate of future net operating income assuming it has completed its planned value add asset management initiatives divided by the sum of the purchase price and additional capital expenditure costs that are expected to be incurred in accordance with the company s original underwriting at the time of acquisition this information is not audited or reviewed by independent accountants and may be presented in a manner that is different from similar information included in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap estimated forward return on cost is based on management s current expectations and are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and involve known and unknown risks for example estimated forward return on cost is based in part on data made available to us during the course of our due diligence process in connection with asset acquisitions and assumes the timely and on budget completion of our value add initiatives the timely leasing of all additional capacity and the absence of customer defaults or early lease terminations accordingly

non gaap measure representing the income produced by a property calculated by deducting certain property expenses from property revenues our management uses net operating income to assess and compare the performance of our properties and to estimate their fair value net operating income does not include the effects of depreciation or amortization or gains or losses from the sale of properties

over the corresponding 2017 quarter for the year ended december 31 2018 cash settled share based payments were three times higher than in the 2017 year the fluctuations in cash settled share based

as at december 31 2018 the credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the corporation s assets cash requirements for capital expenditures historically the corporation has financed its capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash flows from operating activities debt and from time to time the issuance of equity the 2019 capital budget has been set at 15 0 million subject to quarterly review of the board these planned expenditures are expected to be financed primarily by funds from operations however if a sustained period of market and commodity price uncertainty and financial market volatility persists in 2019 the corporation s activity levels cash flows and access to credit may be negatively impacted in which event the proceeds from borrowing may be required to fund operations and the expenditure level would be reduced accordingly conversely if future growth opportunities present themselves the corporation might consider expanding this planned capital expenditure amount outlook the 2018 year produced many positive results for the corporation including the highest adjusted ebitda and highest consolidated activity levels since 2014 phx energy has been strategically focused on growth in the us market and expanding its product offering to include disruptive high margin technologies these initiatives fueled the achievements in the 2018 year with the us segment generating strong financial and operational performance and its fleet of high performance technologies contributing to increased revenue and improved profitability as expected in the fourth quarter and throughout 2018 the us division remained the largest area of opportunity for the corporation phx energy is generating operational and financial results in the us that are some of the highest achievements in its history in the 2018 year phx energy s us growth outpaced the industry and the division increased its market share which can be partially attributed to the atlas high performance motor and velocity fleet the division s profitability was also positively impacted by the acquisition of powerdrive orbit rss systems in the fourth quarter of the year the majority of the corporation s services and assets were deployed to the us market where the industry remains favorable and phx energy will continue this focus in 2019 the us market is subject to the current commodity price volatility and some short term take away constraints and this is anticipated to temper industry activity in 2019 phx energy remains optimistic that its unique suite of high performance technology will allow its strong performance and momentum in the us to continue through 2019 in contrast 2018 was a challenging year for the canadian industry and as a result also for phx energy s canadian operations commodity price volatility limited access to market and overall uncertainty surrounding the entire energy industry hampered opportunity in this market phx energy remains committed to the canadian market and its new technologies have aided its ability to maintain its strong position looking forward into 2019 activity levels in canada are forecasted to decline as the challenges the industry faces persist through this phx energy will continue to diligently monitor its cost controls and strive to support its clients and the industry by delivering reliable innovative and cost effective solutions phx energy s international operations saw a slight decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter as well as in the 2018 year in russia the corporation was adversely impacted by a key operators lower activity and the division is focused on diversifying its client base as it continues to target both the mwd rental and full service sides of the business in albania additional rigs were added in the latter part of 2018 which offset declines in russia however the albania operations are sensitive to the volatility in commodity prices and phx energy remains focused on providing exceptional service to our clients technology update the corporation has been strategically focused on setting itself apart as a leader in high performance technology and as a result of its technology initiatives has become one of the top competitors in the north american land based drilling market in 2018 the atlas high performance motor fleet delivered the expected results being recognized as a robust and powerful motor and consequently generated additional revenue and higher margins phx energy had a small fleet of these motors in 2018 and has dedicated a large portion of the 2018 and 2019 capital expenditure programs to grow its capacity with the success of the initial atlas motor design phx energy is expanding its fleet to include additional configurations for a greater variety of drilling applications these configurations as well as the additional capacity within the current fleet is anticipated to further aide profitability in the latter part of 2019 as the new assets are expected to arrive in the first half of the year during the fourth quarter of 2018 phx energy entered into a purchase agreement with schlumberger to purchase an initial fleet of powerdrive orbit rss systems and an accompanying license to operate this system in the us there is a high demand for rss services and this capability adds another high margin technology to phx energy s product offering in the 2018 fourth quarter rss services contributed to the higher revenue per day and profitability achieved in the us segment the powerdrive rss technology adds to the suite of differentiating technology phx energy has been developing and when these technologies are operated in conjunction with each other provides phx energy with a proprietary drilling solution to offer the market phx energy looks to further build upon the platform it has developed with atlas high performance motors velocity and powerdrive rss and has dedicated engineering efforts to additional new technology initiatives there were many financial operational and technological achievements in 2018 for phx energy and the corporation intends to build upon this momentum where possible that being said the outlook for the north american industry remains divided and fragile the fourth quarter saw commodity prices fall losing the gains achieved in the first part of the year and although they have subtlety recovered this has led to uncertainty in the industry and 2019 may retract slightly when compared to the 2018 year phx energy has built a strong financial position with a low level of debt and improved margins and it will strive to continue this with its diligent cost management and deployment and development of high performance technologies through the 2019 year michael buker president

before commenting on the results i would like to highlight the fact that cascades is delivering record annual performance in terms of adjusted oibd and health safety i also would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees customers business partners and stakeholders for their ongoing contribution and support containerboard packaging results point to continued solid fundamentals in the fourth quarter with sequential performance reflecting customary seasonal changes in sales mix and volumes in the last three months of the year in addition to scheduled downtime for maintenance and to complete capital projects european boxboard via our equity position in reno de medici s p a generated good results during the period driven by a higher average selling price lower raw material prices and the acquisition of barcelona cartonboard sau at the end of october the specialty products segment generated lower results in the last three months of the year reflecting a lower contribution from the recovery sub segment as previously disclosed fourth quarter performance of the tissue operations were well below expectations the results of this segment were negatively impacted by the continued challenging industry and operational conditions in addition to several non recurring events that led to higher logistics costs within the platform and higher gas costs for operations on the west coast operational difficulties at the st helens tissue mill in oregon also negatively affected performance during the last three months of the year with these issues leading to inefficiencies at the scappoose converting facility that it supplies the corporation reviewed the recoverable value of its assets and recorded an impairment charge of 75 million on certain u s assets management has developed an action plan that it is implementing to successfully redress profitability in this group on the strategic front we completed several important investments during the fourth quarter in late october the european boxboard segment finalized the acquisition of barcelona cartonboard sau subsequently in late november we communicated details about an important investment in the wagram n c tissue converting facility as part of our capital expenditure plan the project involves the installation of new state of the art converting lines and the modernization of several existing lines with commissioning expected to begin in the second quarter of 2019 and finalized in the first half of 2020 in early december we announced the acquisition of u s moulded pulp assets which will double production capacity of ecological packaging manufactured in moulded pulp in the specialty products segment and support the ongoing development of the consumer products sub segment strategically this acquisition improves our positioning in the fresh protein and food service packaging markets and given that these products are recycled recyclable compostable and biodegradable it is fully aligned with our circular economy market approach finally the company increased its authorized credit facility to incorporate a seven year term loan at the end of december the facility increases

period last year sales of 1 196 million increased by 114 million or 11 compared to the same period last year this was driven by a 13 increase in the tissue segment reflecting volume improvements and a more favourable sales mix exchange rate and average selling price during the period a 7 increase in the containerboard packaging group similarly benefited sales and was driven by higher selling prices and the acquisition of converting facilities in ontario at the end of 2017 sales generated by the european boxboard segment were up by 16 compared to the prior year reflecting higher shipments acquisitions in the last twelve months and a more favourable canadian dollar euro exchange rate finally fourth quarter sales in the specialty products segment improved 7 from prior year levels as the benefits of the recent acquisition and slight improvements in selling price and sales mix were slightly offset by lower sales in recovery activities following the year over year decrease in brown recycled fibres prices the corporation generated an operating income before depreciation and amortization oibd of 37 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this compared to the 104 million generated in the comparable period last year in addition to the 75 million impairment charge recorded in the tissue segment during the period the variance reflects higher production costs in all segments higher energy costs in european boxboard and tissue slightly lower volume in both containerboard and boxboard europe excluding acquisitions and a lower contribution from recovery operations within the specialty products segment related to changes in raw material pricing these were offset by improvements generated from higher selling prices and more favourable sales mix in all business segments and business acquisitions in the last twelve months operating income before depreciation and amortization similarly benefited from favourable raw material prices on a net basis as the beneficial impact of lower occ pricing on containerboard results outweighed the significant consequence of higher year over year white recycled fibre and pulp pricing on tissue segment results on an adjusted basis1 fourth

supplemental information on non ifrs measures section near term and strategic outlook commenting short term expectations mr plourde commented we expect stable near term performance from the containerboard segment with lower raw material pricing providing some counterbalance to seasonally softer demand levels and a slight decrease in medium selling prices given the sound economic metrics in north america our near term outlook for this segment remains positive the outlook for tissue is not as robust in the near term while recent decreases in raw material pricing and the continued implementation of announced price increases in some product sub segments are positive for this business any resulting benefits are being counterbalanced by difficult industry wide market dynamics and operational challenges at our st helens mill in oregon as such we expect financial performance will remain under pressure management is focused on the resolution of these issues and is currently implementing the actions required in addition to the modernization efforts already underway to successfully realign the tissue segment s operational performance with targeted profitability levels in europe in addition to acquisitions completed in 2018 macro economic and political factors support a moderately positive near term outlook specifically demand softness is expected to be counterbalanced by favourable raw material pricing expectations of slightly lower energy costs and the implementation of price increases in virgin boxboard offset by pricing pressure in the recycled boxboard business

china s authorities are committed to advancing the shift toward a market driven economy with a fully flexible exchange rate regime that means that while it can credibly commit not to keep the value of the renminbi artificially low it must reject us demands to keep the exchange rate stable against the dollar beijing the united states is reportedly pushing china to agree to keep the value of the renminbi stable as part of a deal to end the trade war between the world s two largest economies it is a demand that china must think twice about before accepting the renminbi was undoubtedly undervalued for many years including through a peg to the us dollar that was established in 1998 a undervalued renminbi was an important contributing factor to the trade surplus that china has run consistently since 1993 when its per capita income stood at just 400 in other words even when china was a very poor country it was exporting capital to the rest of the world especially the us though running a trade surplus benefits some sectors of the economy for some period of time it is unclear that it benefits the economy as a whole in the long run still two decades of maintaining a current account surplus which includes trade together with a capital account surplus fueled by large inflows of foreign direct investment enabled china to accumulate huge foreign exchange reserves and a large stock of fdi as a result though china is one of the world s largest creditors it has run an investment income deficit for more than a decade but over the last 15 years or so china has been working to correct its trade imbalances since 2005 when the renminbi s dollar peg was eliminated it has appreciated steadily by the end of 2013 its exchange against the dollar had strengthened by 35 in the same year china s current account surplus fell to just 2 of gdp from its 2007 peak of 10 1 moreover since 2014 when looser capital controls left china s capital account more responsive to broader changes in the global economy the country has started to run significant capital account deficits from time to time sometimes those deficits are large enough to put the entire balance of payments in deficit despite the trade surplus on august 11 2015 china took a major step to boost exchange rate flexibility instead of setting a daily midpoint for the renminbi independently the people s bank of china began basing the midpoint on the previous day s closing prices initially there was only slight downward pressure on the renminbi in the foreign exchange market but the poorly timed move ended up fueling expectations of currency devaluation spurring a surge in capital outflows that drove down the renminbi s value further subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps

including former us federal reserve chair janet yellen in a recent interview have suggested that china devalued its currency that summer in order to offset the effects of an appreciating dollar on the economy s international competitiveness the truth is that china precisely because it feared that a depreciation would trigger even stronger expectations of further devaluation ultimately endangering china s financial stability abruptly canceled the reform just days after it was initiated and began to intervene heavily in the foreign exchange market to arrest the currency s decline when those interventions slowed in 2016 the renminbi began to depreciate again spurring the pboc to resume intervention the pboc spent some 1 trillion of china s foreign exchange reserves in less than two years to stem downward pressure on the exchange rate in 2017 thanks to the tightening of capital controls and a fall in the dollar index the renminbi exchange rate finally stabilized there is no evidence that china has intervened to weaken the renminbi since not even to offset the impact of higher us tariffs on chinese exports even as the exchange rate has fluctuated in response to fears about the trade war the chinese government knows that it is not in its best interests to manipulate its exchange rate and given china s financial vulnerabilities devaluation is particularly unappealing so while the trump administration s fear that china is manipulating its exchange rate to gain a trade advantage is not irrational it is unfounded still china cannot commit to keep the renminbi stable against the us dollar china s economic cycles are not synchronized with those of the us the federal reserve may raise the federal funds rate at a time when the pboc needs to cut its interest rate which would spur capital outflows and drive down the renminbi s value it is a country s sovereign right to decide its exchange rate policy and the us cannot expect to dictate china s so even as it listens humbly to america s complaints china must retain full authority over its approach to the renminbi and be able to loosen monetary policy when economic conditions dictate regardless of whether that causes the renminbi to depreciate the us would disapprove but what other choice would china have it cannot forfeit its monetary independence and it is not in china s interest to block capital outflows to offset depreciation pressure nor can it continue to use its hard earned and limited foreign exchange reserves to prop up the renminbi s value how can china be sure the balance is enough to maintain exchange rate stability indefinitely complicating matters further the relationship between the renminbi s value and the us dollar is not just bilateral china has already committed to cut its trade surplus with the us which comprises the majority of china s overall trade surplus if the us dollar rises in this context china s current account is likely to swing into deficit again is china supposed to cut its imports from the rest of the world by whatever means necessary or sacrifice its foreign exchange reserves this is not a purely bilateral issue exchange rate misalignments often require international coordination to resolve china s authorities are committed to advancing the shift toward a market driven economy with a fully flexible exchange rate regime so in the current trade negotiations with the us it can credibly commit not to keep the value of the renminbi artificially low but under no circumstances should it promise to keep the exchange rate stable against the dollar
by lucia mutikani washington reuters the u s economy fell short of the trump administration s 3 percent annual growth target in 2018 despite 1 5 trillion in tax cuts and a government spending blitz and economists say growth will only slow from here a better than expected performance in the fourth quarter pushed gross domestic product up 2 9 percent for the year just shy of the goal commerce department data showed on thursday president donald trump has touted the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his term and declared last july that his administration had accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions on the campaign trail trump boasted that he could boost annual economic growth to 4 percent a goal that analysts always said was unachievable we are moving back to a sustainable growth pace that we experienced during most of the obama years said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania with the tax cut impacts largely done with it is hard to see how growth can accelerate sharply gross domestic product increased at a 2 6 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter after advancing at a 3 4 percent pace in the july september period economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp rising at a 2 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter growth in 2018 was the strongest since 2015 and better than the 2 2 percent logged in 2017 the expansion will be the longest on record in july the stronger than expected fourth quarter performance which reflected solid consumer and business spending was despite many headwinds including financial market volatility and the united states trade war with china raising optimism that an anticipated slowdown this year would not be abrupt the fiscal stimulus is believed to have peaked sometime in the fourth quarter december economic data such as retail sales exports homebuilding and business spending on equipment weakened sharply in addition most manufacturing measures softened in january and february and motor vehicle demand has eased the labor market is also exhibiting signs of cooling with a report from the labor department on thursday showing the number of americans receiving unemployment benefits rising to a 10 month high in the week ended feb 16 the first quarter won t be this good said paul ashworth chief economist at capital economics in toronto as the stimulus fades and the lagged impact of past monetary tightening continues to feed through we expect gdp growth to slow to 2 2 percent this year slowing growth together with weakening global demand and uncertainty over britain s departure from the european union support the federal reserve s patient stance towards raising interest rates further this year fed chairman jerome powell reaffirmed the u s central bank s position in his testimonies before lawmakers on tuesday and wednesday inflation was largely muted in the fourth quarter the dollar trimmed losses against a basket of currencies on the gdp data and was last trading little changed u s treasury prices fell while stocks on wall street were lower following weak earnings from a handful of companies solid consumer spending the fourth quarter gdp report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the government that ended on jan 25 which affected the collection and processing of economic data the commerce department said it could not quantify the full effects of the shutdown on fourth quarter gdp growth economists expect the longest shutdown in history will hurt growth in the first quarter growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity increased at a still strong 2 8 percent rate in the fourth quarter consumer spending grew at a robust 3 5 percent rate in the third quarter consumption continues to be underpinned by a strong labor market with inflation adjusted income at the disposal of households jumping at a 4 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter compared to a 2 6 percent pace in the prior period a moderation in spending is however likely amid reports 2018 tax refunds have been smaller than in the previous years business spending on equipment accelerated in the fourth quarter from the prior period growing at a 6 7 percent rate after losing speed since the first quarter of 2018 the trade deficit widened further as a combination of the u s china trade dispute strong dollar and weakening global demand restrained export growth the trade tensions also led businesses to hoard imports the trade shortfall subtracted 0 22 percentage point from fourth quarter gdp growth after slicing off 2 percentage points in the july september period with consumer spending slowing some of the imports ended up in warehouses accelerating the pace of inventory accumulation while that offset some of the drag on gdp growth from the trade deficit the piling up of stock is bad news for first quarter growth inventories increased at a 97 1 billion rate in the fourth quarter after rising at an 89 8 billion pace in the july september quarter inventory investment added 0 13 percentage point to gdp growth last quarter after contributing 2 33 percentage points in the prior period there was a rapid buildup of inventories in the fourth quarter so inventories likely will be a headwind for growth in the future said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york residential construction contracted at a 3 5 percent rate marking the fourth straight quarterly decline homebuilding has been weighed down by higher mortgage rates land and labor shortages as well a tariffs on imported lumber government investment increased at a 0 4 percent rate the slowest since the third quarter of 2017 nondefense investment contracted at a 5 6 percent rate the biggest decline in five years likely reflecting the effects of the five week government shutdown reporting by lucia mutikani editing by tomasz janowski and andrea ricci
briefing highlights foreign investors sour on canada current account deficit swells stocks loonie oil at a glance cibc raises dividend as profit slips td raises dividend too as profit dips u s economic growth slows the snc lavalin controversy encana swings to quarterly profit blackberry sues twitter from today s globe and mail sentiment turns foreign investors are souring on canada so much so that last year marked the slowest in 11 for net investment in canadian securities among foreigners not only that december alone saw non residents divest holdings of canadian bonds by what statistics canada said was an unprecedented 24 8 billion all of this is important for several reasons including what it could mean for the canadian dollar and the country s current account deficit the latest numbers for which we ll see today canada s current account deficit means a persistent need for foreign financing so it is always watching appetite for canadian assets said elsa lignos royal bank of canada s head of foreign exchange strategy in london all of this is important for several reasons including what it could mean for the canadian dollar and the country s current account deficit and we got the latest reading for that this morning the current account deficit swelled by 5 4 billion in the fourth quarter to 15 5 billion which was fatter than some economists had expected statistics canada said today this increase reflected a higher trade in goods and services deficit which was moderated by a lower investment income deficit the federal agency said the goods and services shortfall expanded by 6 1 billion with exports falling 7 3 billion largely because of lower energy prices most of that widening was due to the fall in energy prices something that has partially rebounded so far in 2019 said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes oil prices alone won t likely be able to reverse all of the widening seen in the latest report he added the persistent current account deficit is one of the key reasons we see the need for the canadian dollar to be even weaker in the years ahead for all of 2018 the deficit actually narrowed by 1 4 billion to 58 7 billion which was the lowest in four years as for foreign investors there was a net outflow from canadian securities of 18 5 billion in december for all of 2018 there was a net inflow of 11 4 billion a marked drop from 2017 s 104 5 billion and the slowest pace in 11 years the exodus from bonds came in both government and corporate paper the latter largely because they were maturing the entire year saw a net inflow of just 42 billion into canadian debt securities down from 132 6 billion in 2017 and the slowest pace in five years that was largely on weaker external demand for canadian

cents against the u s dollar on the other side of the ledger though non residents bought canadian stocks at the fastest rate since may 2017 with an inflow of 6 7 billion over the course of 2018 such stock purchases amounted to 27 5 billion down from 2017 which was a record year helping drive the turnaround in sentiment to canadian bonds is the fact that with its triple a rating canada had been an attractive market not only that but the u s and european central banks had been buying domestic bonds to force down their yields and help juice their economies meaning investors had to look elsewhere said cibc senior economist andrew grantham but demand for canadian assets is now waning because of more supply in the u s and because interest rates are higher there when you put it all together there s a clearer path for cad to reach something closer to its modelled fair value which is around usdcad 1 40 mr grantham said he was referring to the u s and canadian dollars by their symbols and that 1 40 translates to a loonie worth just shy of 71 5 us cents at some point rbc s ms lignos isn t particularly worried about the currency at this point while non residents were shedding canadian bonds they were net buyers of canadian equities offsetting around a third of their net bond sales ms lignos said canadian investors kept their holdings of foreign equities roughly flat so there was a net equity inflow she added citing other reasons as well nonetheless there could still be trouble for the loonie down the road ms lignos said it highlights canada s vulnerability to a global slowdown canada s deficit is both less likely to be self correcting in the long term and more tenuously financed than some of its g10 peers she said if that doesn t change before the next downturn cad will be more at risk national bank senior economist krishen rangasamy agreed financing of the external deficit has come courtesy of short term foreign capital which has potential to quickly disappear he said

in both physics and monetary policy common sense is not always a perfect guide the idea that time passes at different rates depending on your velocity as albert einstein s theory of relativity tells us is hard to grasp intuitively that light emitted from the front of an accelerating object still travels a constant speed seems absurd and when new concepts such as modern monetary theory mmt the idea governments which control their own money have little need for fiscal austerity come along it seems normal that the first intuitive reaction will be nonsense that is certainly how u s federal reserve chair jerome powell responded when asked about mmt at congressional hearings earlier this week just wrong the idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency i think is just wrong said powell u s debt is fairly high to the level of gdp and much more importantly it s growing faster than gdp really significantly faster we are going to have to spend less or raise more revenue intuitively that sounds right just as with our household accounts once we are deeply in debt the only way out is to spend less or earn more at some point lenders will stop lending and interest payments will become prohibitive the only alternative to austerity is bankruptcy and perhaps poverty but just as special relativity does not apply when we are rushing to an appointment no matter how fast it is an absolute fact that government finances and the ability of central banks to create money has very little to do with the way you manage your personal budget u s federal reserve chair jerome powell does not think much of modern monetary theory jim young reuters in some ways einstein s special relativity discussed with various levels of exactitude in popular science fiction is more accessible than the principles of monetary theory as a popular genre monetary theory fiction does not exist not only that but monetary theory like economics as a whole may also be harder to tie down and examine whereas the vast majority of scientists guided by theory and experiment based on a common data set have the same basic idea of how relativity works any two economists are likely to disagree as noam chomsky reminded us complex unfamiliar concepts do not lend themselves to capsule explanation but in essence mmt is the idea that a government s debt to gdp ratio even when it rises to 200 per cent need not create inflation in an economy that controls its own currency keep on spending mmt s idea is instead that governments should keep on spending until such time as every person is employed and inflation finally kicks in the government then can take action of some kind raising taxes for instance to arrest that inflation for most of us a new brilliant and complex way of understanding economics or science is impossible to distinguish from bafflegab but in a clear and excellent piece on the financial times site alphaville brendan greeley writes that mmt is neither marxist nor is it bullshit to the horror of proponents of small government mmt appears to give the u s congress as well as countries like canada and the u k with their own currency carte blanche for spending on programs like the green new deal but the theory s critics do not just include traditional anti tax think tanks and republicans centre left economist paul krugman writing in the new york times has been a vociferous opponent of mmt prompting counter arguments from the current high profile proponent of the idea stephanie kelton a professor of public policy and economics at stony brook university in new york stephanie kelton an economics professor at stony brook university is currently the best known proponent of modern monetary theory stony brook university the debate will clearly not be resolved here but for those who are interested there has been plenty of ink spilled and breath expended on the subject including this long interview with kelton on the podcast left out basing her argument on the writings of illustrious economic thinkers such as john maynard keynes and adam smith and using the example of the u s funding of the second world war and japan s current economy kelton says people like powell and krugman are trapped in old conventional thinking radically new ideas in economics as in science are almost universally opposed at first by the old guard and there is logic in that response an untried idea that didn t work could bring an entire economy crashing down but even ideas that turned out to be successful were attacked when they were proposed exchanging the gold standard for the u s dollar in 1944 and then the ending of the convertibility of dollars for gold in 1971 both led to predictions of doom i ve spoken to scholars who feel the danger isn t yet over in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown plans for central banks to inject money imagined into existence with quantitative easing and other schemes to cut interest rates below zero or to distribute cash to the public using helicopter money all had traditionalists twisting their shirt tails with worry it is no wonder that the idea of changing the conventional rules about spending inflation government bonds and interest rates as it seems mmt would leave those of us who have long considered those things to be real and solid facts baffled and a little lost but that doesn t prove it wouldn t work follow don on twitter don_pittis
wednesday the state of maine took america one giant step closer to ending the antidemocratic grip the gop s had on our presidential elections even though george w bush lost the 2000 election by a half million votes nationally and donald trump lost in 2016 by 3 million votes both ended up in the white house because of the electoral college the problem with getting rid of the electoral college is that it s written into the constitution amending that document takes two thirds of the house and senate and three quarters of the states and that isn t happening any day soon read a criminologist explains why keeping trump from the white house is all that matters but because the constitution also says that individual states can determine on their own how to assign their electoral votes there s a way to get around the electoral college altogether right now all but two states give 100 of their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who won the most votes in the state maine and nebraska split their states in two but assign all electoral votes to whoever won the most popular votes in each region but they don t have to a state under the constitution can assign their electoral votes to any candidate they want when it looked like al gore was going to win florida in 2000 for example the speaker of the florida house prepared legislation authorizing the governor jeb bush to give the state s electoral votes and thus the presidency to his brother george w bush regardless of who the recount determined won the popular vote in that state so some smart political and constitutional minds got together and came up with a system whereby states representing 270 electoral votes the amount to become president pledge to commit all of their electoral votes regardless of who won in their individual state to whichever candidate won the national popular vote to accomplish this they organized what they call the national popular vote interstate compact npvic and states have been signing up for several decades with maine they re at 209 electoral college votes and michigan with 16 electoral college votes will be the next state to join as the national popular vote legislation is working its way through their legislature now by about two to one 65 of americans favor this change so the person who wins the country also wins the white house as you can imagine republicans hate the idea and are threatening litigation under an ancient and anachronistic law if it passes by this system we would have had president al gore and president hillary clinton the supreme court would today have a pronounced progressive tilt a half million americans would not have died of covid and the country wouldn t have lost two decades in the fight against global warming all because that s what the majority of americans actually voted for democracy after all yesterday maine s legislature passed with votes of both democrats and republicans a bill joining the compact bringing the total number of electoral votes now held by compact states to 209 with michigan we ll be at 225 most americans are rightly confused by the entire process and only a small percentage could even accurately describe what the electoral college is or why it s in the constitution the history is fascinating america s founders and framers thought they could use the electoral college to prevent somebody like donald trump from ever becoming president seriously unfortunately they were wrong and now we re paying the price it s often said that the electoral college was brought into being to perpetuate or protect the institution of slavery and indeed during the first half century of america it gave the slave states several presidents who wouldn t have been otherwise elected this is because there s one elector in the college for every member of the house and senate and three for the district of columbia when the three fifths compromise was in effect until just after the civil war slave states had more members in the house of representatives than the size of their voting public deserved it s now true of red states and the senate where republicans represent only 145 million americans and democrats represent 186 million americans but republicans hold fully 50 of the vote this explains in part why when madison proposed the electoral college the framers seized on it as a compromise solution after weeks of drawn out and often angry debate on how to select a president most amazing according to the framers of the constitution themselves the real reason for the electoral college was to prevent a foreign power like russia from placing their stooge in the white house today we re horrified by the idea that donald trump may actually be putting first the interests of russia and china and that money and other efforts from multiple foreign entities may have helped him get elected it s shocking something we never even really took seriously when for example the movie manchurian candidate came out back in the day what a cute idea for a movie we thought that could never happen here but this was actually a big deal for the founding generation one of the first questions about any candidate for president during that era was is he beholden in any way to any other government at the time of the declaration of independence it s estimated that nearly two thirds of all citizens of the american colonies favored remaining a british colony jimmy carter s novel the hornet s nest is a great resource there were spies and british loyalists everywhere and spain had staked out their claim to the region around florida while the french were colonizing what is now canada and louisiana foreign powers had us boxed in in 1775 the year the revolutionary war unofficially started virtually all of the colonists had familial friendship or business acquaintances with people whose loyalty was suspect or who were openly opposed to american independence it was even rumored that ben franklin was working as a spy for british intelligence and it turns out evidence shows he was only against france when he lived in paris conservative federalists in particular were wary of franklin s internationalist sentiments jefferson was living in france when the constitution was being written and his political enemies were even then it got much louder around the election of 1800 whispering that he had at best mixed loyalties in response he felt the need to protest to elbridge gerry that the first object of my heart is my own country in that is embarked my family my fortune and my own existence when john adams famously defended british soldiers who during an anti british riot on march 5 1770 shot and killed crispus attucks and four others he was widely condemned for being too pro british an issue that recurred in 1798 when as president adams pushed the alien and sedition laws through congress over vice president thomas jefferson s loud objections british spy gilbert barkley wrote to his spymasters in london that quakers and many other americans considered adams an enemy to his country and after the revolutionary war the nation was abuzz about one of that war s most decorated soldiers benedict arnold once considered a shoo in for high elected office selling out to the british in exchange for money and a title so it fell to a fatherless man born in nevins to explain to americans that the main purpose of the electoral college was to make sure that no agent of a foreign government would ever become president back then america was so spread out it would be difficult for most citizen voters to get to know a presidential candidate well enough to spot a spy or traitor alexander hamilton explained in federalist 68 therefore the electors having no other governmental duty obligation or responsibility would be sure to catch one if it was tried the most deadly adversaries of america hamilton wrote would probably make their approaches from more than one quarter chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils influencing public opinion or owning a senator was nothing compared to having their man in the white house as hamilton wrote how could they better gratify this than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the union but hamilton wrote the framers of the constitution have guarded against all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious attention the system they set up to protect the white house from being occupied by an agent of a foreign government was straightforward hamilton bragged the choice of president would not depend on any preexisting bodies of men who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes instead the electoral college would be made up of persons for the temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment the electors would be apolitical because it would be illegal for a senator or house member to become one hamilton wrote and they have excluded from eligibility to this trust all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in office no senator representative or other person holding a place of trust or profit under the united states can be of the numbers of the electors this hamilton was certain would eliminate any sinister bias excluding members of congress who may be subject to bribery or foreign influences the electors would select a man for president who was brave of heart and pure of soul the process of election affords a moral certainty hamilton wrote that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications indeed while a knave or rogue or traitor may fool enough people to even ascend to the office of mayor of a major city or governor of a state hamilton believed the electoral college would ferret out such a traitor he wrote talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single state but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the men in the electoral college who would select him as president of the whole union hamilton s pride in the system that he himself had helped build was hard for him to suppress he added in federalist 68 it will not be too strong to say that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters preeminent for ability and virtue unfortunately as donald trump proves things haven t worked out that way because the three fifths compromise gave more electors to the slave states than their voting population would indicate the electoral college handed the white house to four virginia slaveholders among our first five presidents since that compromise has been eliminated the electoral college continues to wreak mischief in putting george w bush and donald trump into office hamilton never envisioned a day when a man so entangled in financial affairs with foreign governments as is donald trump could even be seriously considered because in his mind the electors would carefully investigate the candidate that hasn t happened in over a century so by his standards the electors totally failed in their job in the 2000 and 2016 elections the electoral college was a compromise designed to keep the president above political considerations it was sold to the public as a way to prevent an agent witting or unwitting of a foreign power from becoming president it has failed on both counts through the arc of time since her founding america has constantly albeit in fits and starts expanded democracy from expanding the vote to include racial minorities and women to amending the constitution to allow for citizens to vote for u s senators rather than having them appointed by often corrupted state legislatures average citizens of all races and genders have been brought into the decisions around who will lead us but in the past two decades the electoral college has brought us two presidents who were rejected by a majority of americans this is fundamentally undemocratic the national popular vote interstate compact can fix this if the supreme court doesn t intervene in response to a gop lawsuit check out your state on their website if democrats can flip a few more red states blue this november and with abortion on the ballot that s a real possibility we might be able to get this done in time for the 2028 election now read how donald trump is spreading a dangerous mental illness to his supporters

income was 53 1 million or 0 46 per diluted share compared to 46 6 million or 0 40 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 the year over year increase of 6 5 million or 14 0 percent was primarily driven by improved operating results and lower interest expense adjusted ebitda fourth quarter adjusted ebitda grew 28 1 million to 125 0 million compared to 96 9 million in the period a year ago an increase of 29 0 percent the year over year improvement was largely driven by the increase in sales particularly in the value added product categories and the company s expanded gross margin percentage as a result adjusted ebitda improved to 6 9 percent of sales in the fourth quarter from 5 4 percent in the same period a year ago full year december 31 2018 financial information net sales net sales for the full year 2018 were 7 7 billion a 9 8 percent increase over the prior year comprised of an estimated sales unit volume growth of 3 2 percent and approximately 6 6 percent of commodity price inflation single family and repair and remodel other end market sales unit volume growth in 2018 was partially offset by expected declines in the multi family end markets additionally value added products grew by 10 5 percent gross margin gross margin increased for the full year 2018 by 195 5 million to 1 922 9 million gross margin percentage increased to 24 9 percent from 24 6 percent in 2017 a 30 basis point increase the pressure experienced on gross margin percentage during the first half of 2018 due to rising commodity costs relative to our customer pricing commitments was more than offset by the sharp decline in commodity costs during the second half of the year rapid commodity inflation or deflation can cause short term gross margin percentage fluctuations whereas higher or lower sustained commodity prices will over time increase or decrease respectively the company s sales gross margin and adjusted ebitda dollars interest expense interest expense was 108 2 million in 2018 a decrease of 85 0 million from 2017 this decrease which is largely attributable to the capital management strategy executed in both 2018 and 2017 was partially offset by increased interest expense due to increased market interest rates on our floating rate debt instruments interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018 included a 3 2 million gain on debt extinguishment excluding the one time charges of 58 7 million related to the debt transactions executed in 2017 interest expense decreased by 26 3 million net income net income for the full year 2018 was 205 2 million or 1 76 per diluted share compared to 38 8 million or 0 34 per diluted share in 2017 an increase of 1 42 per diluted share driven by improved operating results for the full year 2018 and the one time costs related to the refinancing transactions in the prior year adjusted net income for the full year 2018 was 221 2 million or 1 90 per diluted share compared to 147 2 million or 1 27 per diluted share for the full year 2017 an increase of 0 63 per diluted share the year over year increase of 74 0 million or 50 3 percent was primarily driven by the company s sales growth improved margin and lower interest expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda for the full year 2018 grew 82 6 million to 501 6 million or 6 5 percent of sales compared to 419 0 million or 6 0 percent of sales for the prior year the year over year improvement was attributable to cost leverage and the growth in higher margin value added products partially offset by an increase in variable costs including sales commissions and incentives related to the profitable growth in 2018 capital structure leverage and liquidity information net debt as of december 31 2018 declined by 179 million to 1 567 million as compared to the prior year end the company decreased its leverage ratio versus december 31 2017 by 1 1x to 3 1x net debt adjusted ebitda achieving a goal announced in 2015 to manage the balance sheet leverage ratio between 2 5x and 3 5x due to the substantial conversion of working capital during the fourth quarter net cash generated in operations and investing was 186 2 million for the full

during the quarter compared to 0 1 million last year net loss included 8 1 million of charges 7 2 million non cash related to the closure of the burkina faso operations net cash increased 5 3 million during the quarter to 20 2 million recipient of the pdac safe day everyday gold award for the second consecutive year our third quarter results reflect a normal part of our operational pattern as mining and exploration companies shut down operations in some cases for extended periods over the holiday season additionally the company typically schedules substantial overhaul and maintenance work on its equipment during this slower period said denis larocque president and ceo of major drilling group international inc as expected january had a slow start as we were still waiting on customer plans for calendar 2019 and many of our rigs only restarted between late january and mid february despite this seasonal slowdown the company generated 2 8 million of ebitda and the company s net cash position net of debt improved by 5 3 million over the last three months to end the quarter at 20 2 million capital expenditures were 6 3 million this quarter as we added seven rigs that fit both our specialized and diversification strategies during the quarter we sold four rigs to local contractors in burkina faso and disposed of eighteen older inefficient underground rigs in line with our strategy of improving our underground fleet and services this brings the fleet total to 610 rigs added mr larocque we are continuing to make investments in innovation directed towards increased productivity safety and meeting customers demands we keep growing our fleet of computerized rigs as well as retrofitting some of our newer rigs with computerized consoles this falls in line with the enhancement of our recruiting and training systems as we bring in a new generation of employees while strengthening our customer service said mr larocque as we look forward the fundamentals driving the business continue to be encouraging for the coming quarter and into fiscal 2020 gold prices have increased recently and mineral reserves for gold and base metals continue to be depleted many industry experts expect that most base metals will face a significant deficit position in the next few years due to the continued production and high grading of mines combined with the lack of exploration work conducted to replace reserves given this situation most of our senior and intermediate customers have increased their exploration budgets for calendar 2019 and the demand for drilling services continues to increase during the quarter the company made the decision to close its operations in burkina faso and as such took a total charge of 8 1 million after tax this decision was based on the fact that this branch required significant additional investment to reach an acceptable return on investment at a time when political and security risks are increasing in that country the company recorded 6 9 million in restructuring charges consisting of a non cash write down of assets of 6 0 million related to vat receivable write off and impairment charges relating to property plant and equipment and inventory as well as net cash charges of 0 9 million for severance moving costs and lease termination also the company wrote down 1 2 million in deferred tax assets recorded in its deferred tax expense related to burkina faso the burkina faso operations represented approximately 2 of the total company revenue year to date finally we are pleased to be the recipient of the pdac

worked more than 5 000 000 hours over four and a half years without a single lost time injury said denis larocque the safety and well being of our crews is our first and highest responsibility on every project said ben graham vice president hr safety we work hard to earn the trust and support of our crews and we are pleased to see their success recognized by a group of our clients and peers

unaudited in thousands of canadian dollars except per share information 1 nature of activities major drilling group international inc the company is incorporated under the canada business corporations act and has its head office at 111 st george street suite 100 moncton nb canada the company s common shares are listed on the toronto stock exchange tsx the principal source of revenue consists of contract drilling for companies primarily involved in mining and mineral exploration the company has operations in canada the united states mexico south america asia africa and europe 2 basis of presentation statement of compliance these interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ias 34 interim financial reporting ias 34 as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb and using the accounting policies as outlined in the company s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended april 30 2018 except as noted in note 4 on february 28 2019 the board of directors authorized the financial statements for issue basis of consolidation these interim condensed consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company control is achieved when the company is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate intra group transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation where appropriate basis of preparation these interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value using the same accounting policies and methods of computation as presented in the company s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended april 30 2018 except as noted in note 4 3 application of new and revised ifrs the following iasb standards adopted as of may 1 2018 have had no significant impact on the company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements ifrs 2 share based payment ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers the company has not applied the following iasb standard that has been issued but is not yet effective ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 ifrs 16 issued in january 2016 replaces ias 17 leases ifrs 16 specifies how to recognize measure present and disclose leases the standard provides a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged as they continue to classify leases as operating or finance ifrs 16 is effective for periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 the company has undertaken and completed a detailed review of existing contracts against the ifrs 16 criteria and has completed the calculation of lease liabilities for contracts that have been identified as containing right of use assets it is expected that a lease liability of approximately 3 million will be recognized on transition at may 1 2019 the company has elected to apply the modified transition approach whereby no restatement of comparative periods is required right of use assets will be recognized at the amount of the liability on transition leases with terms that end within 12 months of the mandatory transition date will be accounted for by the company as short term leases with payments made under the lease recognized as operating expenses it is expected that the transition to ifrs 16 will result in increases to assets and liabilities of approximately 3 million as well as increases of approximately 0 8 million to depreciation expense and 0 2 million to finance costs and a reduction of operating costs of approximately 1 million 4 changes in significant accounting policies ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 9 replacing ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement ias 39 includes finalized guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities impairment and hedge accounting the company adopted the new requirements on may 1 2018 by applying the requirements for classification and measurement including impairment retrospectively with no restatement of comparative periods financial instruments under ifrs 9 financial assets are classified and measured at amortized cost fair value through other comprehensive income fvtoci or fair value through profit or loss fvtpl and financial liabilities are classified and measured as amortized cost or fvtpl depending on the business model in which they are held and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows all of the company s financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortized cost impairment ifrs 9 replaces the incurred loss model in ias 39 with a forward looking expected credit loss ecl model since the company s trade receivables have a maturity of less than one year the company utilized a practical expedient available under the standard and estimated lifetime ecl using historical credit loss experiences resulting in a minimal impact on the company s financial statements hedge accounting as it was under ias 39 hedge accounting remains optional under ifrs 9 under ifrs 9 the effectiveness test has been replaced with the principle of an economic relationship retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is also no longer required the company s interest rate swap and share forward transaction hedges continue to qualify for hedge accounting under ifrs 9 and as a result the adoption of ifrs 9 did not have a significant impact on its interim condensed consolidated financial statements with respect to hedge accounting the three types of hedges cash flow fair value and net investment remain the same under ifrs 9 all of the company s hedges continue to be classified as fvtoci 5 key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with international financial reporting standards ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources which affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the useful lives of property plant and equipment for depreciation purposes property plant and equipment and inventory valuation determination of income and other taxes assumptions used in the compilation of share based payments fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment testing of goodwill

todayâ s episode with george selgin was taped in front of a live audience on january 15 2019 since this time there has been an important development on the topic of our conversationâ the fedâ s operating system so stick around at the end for an update david beckworth today is a special macro musings episode we are in front of a live audience at the cato institute to chat with george selgin about his new book titled floored how a misguided fed experiment deepened and prolonged the great recession george is the director of the cato instituteâ s and monetary and financial alternatives and as a previous guest on the podcast in fact george i believe you hold the record for the number of appearances on the show number four now is that right george selgin that s right david i m determined to be a number one in at least this david beckworth okay alright we re glad to have you on again and today we re here to talk about your book this is floored and of course george wants you to stop by and get one on the way out if you don t have one already and this book deals with the fedâ s operating system it switched in 2008 from a corridor to a floor system and george i want to begin by asking you when did you first start thinking about this transition and implications for the economy george selgin that s a good question david i know i was thinking about it before i came here to cato which was in the fall of 2014 i had been struck by the fed s decision in 2008 to start paying interest on bank reserves i thought that was a very strange thing for them to be doing at such a time but it wasn t until i was asked to testify on this subject before congress in 2017 that i really began on the path that took me to writing this book because i ended up writing a 22 000 word testimony which i then had to summarize in five minutes before congress but ultimately i chose to do the opposite by expanding that testimony into a book so it was that call to congress i think that really got me on the road to writing an entire book on the subject david beckworth that was a great catalyst because it provided for a nice timing your book just came out and as we know the fomc the federal reserve is now talking about this very issue so the last two fomc meetings the minutes have come out they ve shown us that this has been a big topic they re considering we know in june they re going to have a conference now this conference may or may not touch on this issue but it seems like there s a lot of conversation going on right now about a number of questions facing the fed so this is a well time book george selgin i hope so it isn t clear to what extent the fed is really seriously considering alternatives to the current system including switching to a corridor system we ll talk about what the differences are later i m sure it s not clear just how open they are but the point of the book is to try and make them open to serious discussion of these alternatives instead of allowing sheer momentum to turn this post crisis arrangement into the fedâ s arrangement for all time and i think that that discussion is extremely necessary david beckworth well i d like to think that the discussions we were reading about somewhere in there they have seen or heard some of your arguments on this issue but why don t we go ahead and define what a corridor system is and what a floor system is and maybe even the distinction between the type of corridor system that existed before 2008 and what you would actually envision the fed going to if they did go to a corridor system george selgin sure both a corridor system and a floor system they re both ways of of setting interest rates of having the fed regulate interest rates and by doing so set the stance of monetary policy under a corridor system a version of which is what the fed used before 2008 the fed regulates the federal funds rate which is a market rate that is the rate at which banks lend reserves to one another overnight it s an unsecured overnight market interest rate and the way the fed tried to regulate it was first by setting a desired target level for that federal funds rate a level that had thought would be consistent with having a policy stance that wouldn t be too inflationary or it wouldn t cause unemployment then if the actual rate at which banks were lending to each other differed from that target they would create reserves or reduce the supply of reserves to move the federal funds rate toward the target george selgin so if they wanted to raise the actual federal funds rate because the target was above its current level they would sell bonds in the open market off of their portfolio which amounted to buying reserves back from the banking system that would make reserves more scarce and the federal funds rate would rise towards its target in the opposite situation where they felt that the fed funds rate was higher than where they wanted it to be monetary policy was too tight they would do the opposite they would buy bonds by creating fresh reserves and that would make reserves more plentiful so that was the corridor system and we had a version of that before 2008 in the floor system the fed controls interest rate by interest rates by paying banks a certain rate of interest on reserves and the interest rate it pays banks on reserves indirectly through arbitrage type mechanisms also will govern interest rates on various short term markets george selgin and in that kind of so called floor system the fed first floods the system with reserves and then pays banks to hold on to reserves that s what interests on reserves does and as a result of that there is no scarcity of reserves so it s not just the case that the fed is regulating interest rates without changing the supply of reserves because it can do so by changing the rate of interest it pays banks to hold reserves it s also true that changing the supply of reserves doesn t actually make much of a difference that s how you could have quantitative easing for example where they created trillions of dollars of reserves but because they were operating a floor system that didn t really obviously affect the stance of monetary policy or at least not by changing interest rates the interest rates stayed at 25 basis points where the interest rate on reserves had been set and it stayed there for many years george selgin so those are the basically the two systems one has scarce reserves and no interest on reserves or at least interest rate on reserves isn t regulating this stance of policy the other has plentiful reserves and the stance of policy is set through changing the interest rate on reserves david beckworth okay now there ve been many arguments made for the floor system there are maybe the original arguments some academic arguments made for them in the past there s been some newer arguments made by fed officials so why don t you run down the arguments for a floor system kind of the old and the new george selgin one of the arguments for floor systemâ well let me step back a bit and say if you have a corridor system like we used to have sometimes there ll be situations where that system has to turn into a floor system and i actually believe that a floor system is a good idea when you have no choice but to have such a system when does that happen it happens when the market interest rates fall so low that they fall below to the level where the fed can t make its own policy rate any lower traditionally that was assumed to be zero so if you get a situation where interest rates fall to zero the federal funds rate falls to zero in corridor system it turns into a floor system because at that point of course there s nothing to play with george selgin increasing the supply of reserves doesn t make any difference because the interest rate isn t going to go any lower so in a sense you get a floor system in extremis because there s nothing else you can do so in that circumstance it s crazy to argue against a floor system because you re stuck at the floor no matter what david beckworth youâ re almost forced into one right george selgin yeah and it s a material floor because you can t go any lower so you have a floor system because you can t go any lower but we have had a floor system where you could go lower but the interest rate on reserves is set above zero and the system is flooded with reserves at that above zero rate okay the argument thatâ s made for that kind of floor system is that having plentiful reserves is desirable in itself that it s great to have a banking system that s sitting not on a few 100 billion of reserves which is what was the case before 2008 but on trillions of dollars of reserves because there s all that liquidity and banks don t have to worry about being short of liquidity and therefore they re safer and so on that s one of the key arguments they make is plentiful liquidity and therefore safer banks george selgin the other argument is there s no muss or fuss in adjusting interest rates because it s just a matter of changing the interest rate paid on reserves that s a very easy thing for the fed to do under the old system in contrast the fed had to figure out how to change the supply of reserves in order to move interest rates on the market by doing that and that involved a lot of estimates about the demand for reserves and the elasticity of demand and all that so the folks at the new york fed had to do a lot of homework in order to regulate interest rates and set the stance of monetary policy that homework is no longer necessary that effort s no longer necessary those i think are the two main arguments so not the only ones but theyâ re too david beckworth so just to maybe phrase that last one a little bit differently the federal reserve with the floor system can adjust its target rate set it there and not worry about what itâ s doing with its balance sheet is that fair george selgin that s right david beckworth it can expand the balance sheet put lots of liquidity into the banking system so if there s a banking panic it doesn t have to worry it has extra levers extra hands free to move around and that s one of the big appeals the original appeal my understanding was that this extra lever for monetary policy george selgin yes they d like to say that with interest on reserves the floor system they had two things they could play with separately and they weren t tied together one was they could set the interest rate through the interest on reserves and the other was they could just change the balance sheet but they weren t linked together i make an analogy in the book where let s say we re talking about driving a car in an ordinary car the steering and the accelerator or the gas there s a sense in which they re not completely independent that is the faster you go the more careful you have to be about where you steer and you certainly don t want to try to take a really really sharp turn while going 80 miles an hour say so there was a connection between these two settings and they weren t quite independent and what the fed people are saying essentially is well we ve under this floor system we ve got a situation where we can steer the interest rate as much as we want but we can stomp on the reserve creation gas as much as we want george selgin but those things how much we do of one doesn t affect what we can do with the other one and they see this as great because they can control liquidity in the banking system any way they want to but it doesn t affect controlling the stance of monetary policy which is set independently and they see this as a big virtue i see it as a big problem and i also extend the analogy to explain exactly what i mean by that david beckworth okay what about the argument that a floor system improves interest rate control i mean as you mentioned the interest on excess reserves as an administrative rates so they set it it stays there arbitrage tends to push the other short term rates toward it as opposed to a corridor system is there any merit in that argument george selgin well there is in the sense that you can influence interest rates that way and so certainly if we speak about the fed funds rate is the target you could say that setting the interest rate on reserves is one way to influence the fed funds rate but actually it can be very deceitful this is one of those places where the fed story is a little bit deceitful and that s because this gets a little subtle but in the old system right the fed funds market is very active because the reserves are scarce some banks have to borrow them and others don t so we have a lot of trading in the federal funds market you typically had like 200 billion a day traded in federal funds market and the interest rate in that market was definitely a meaningful interest rate george selgin so changing the supply of reserves could move that interest rate around in a meaningful way and that s how the old system worked in the floor system there s a sense in which the interest rate on reserves perfectly controls the fed funds rate but it s in a trivial sense because in a perfect floor system where all banks have plenty of reserves there s no need for any activity in the federal funds market there is actually no effective federal funds rate interbank rate what you see today is not an interbank grade on the fed funds market it s how much banks are lending to non banks on that market for and that s a side story we don t need to go into so in a pure floor system you have no activity in the fed funds market so there is no fed funds rate so the central bank can say they re kind of perfectly controlling a rate that doesn t actually do anything where there s a market that s not active george selgin and so what really matters is whether setting the interest rate on reserves influences active market rates and it does it does influence other short term market rates not particularly well see it s when we gauge it that way we can ask whether it works better than the old system and i think the answer is no it doesn t work any better than the old system it might work as well for regulating interest rates it s problems have to do with its consequences for other things not for whether it can set interest rates that way or not david beckworth well i raise this question because at the last fomc meeting where the minutes have come out they bring up this issue of interest rate control some of them apparently are worried that if we go to a corridor system we ll have far less control over short term interest rates and i think this speaks to maybe a misunderstanding and i hope you can speak to on the difference between the corridor system we had pre 2008 what a symmetric corridor system would be george selgin so first of all the old system they control the interest rates quite successfully for decades with that old system we know that it worked it wasn t a so called symmetrical corridor i should explain that the reason a corridor system is called a corridor is because you have a target interest rate which is the fed funds rate then you have below it some lower bound which could be zero and was before 2008 and above you have the federal reserve s emergency lending rate or discount rate and the idea was that in principle the actual effective federal funds rate could bounce around between those upper and lower levels but could never exceed them but if the fed open market people were doing their job it didn t deviate very much from the target and that s what all those open market operations are doing is trying to keep those deviations small george selgin and they did a good job of that in the old days now in a symmetrical corridor you can pay interest on reserves and if it s symmetrical the interest rate on reserves is the same distance from the target rate as the emergency lending rate the discount rate whatever you want to call it and so that s the meaning of a symmetrical range now you can set that range as narrowly or as broadly as you like that is the authorities could have a narrow corridor or broader corridor a floor system is kind of an extreme case but if you have a corridor where it s narrow enough there s no way the interest rate can move outside of the confines of that corridor because it s either going to turn into a floor system and it hits the interest rate on reserves or the banks are going to go to the discount window in theory before they borrow for anything above that rate george selgin so that s one point the second point is i don t think it s any harder for the open market operations to manage keeping rates near the target it s not going to be any harder than was before the fed officials claim otherwise because they say well if you look at the volatility of factors that might cause the fed funds rate to move they re very high now but that s because things have changed because we don t have a corridor system if you look at the history as soon as they put this new system in place you had a lot more volatility and reserve demand but that s a consequence of having a different system you go back to the old system you won t have that volatility again there s no reason we can t reverse all the changes that we ve seen though we can also still choose to have a different kind of corridor system instead of the old system david beckworth okay so those are the arguments for a floor system what are the arguments against it george selgin okay this is where we can start talking about the important thing david beckworth in you book yes george selgin yeah because these are all so far we re just talking about technical issues about interest rate control and they re not that interesting because yeah technically these things can all work more or less equally well but there s big more political economy issues that go with the floor system and some of them are more political some of them are there more economy the first thing about a floor system is it necessitates a bigger balance sheet all that liquidity now the fed people say that s wonderful they treat it like a free lunch and in the book i say well there s no such thing as a free lunch there s is no such thing as a free liquidity lunch and that s certainly true today we have the balance sheet of upwards of 4 trillion and reserves proportionately higher and what that means is that s all part of the floor system apparatus george selgin that means that we have the public diverting putting money in banks but the banks are putting a lot of that money in the fed before this new system went into place if you looked at bank deposits and bank loans of all kinds they were approximately 100 percent of bank deposits approximately 100 percent they were a little less most of the time because banks held some reserves including excess reserves with very small amounts relatively speaking and that was true for long long period of time those two values moved almost in lockstep since 2008 since this new system bank loans or 80 percent of bank deposits and reserves are about 20 percent now it s true that means banks are a lot more liquid but it also means there s fewer savings going into loans of all kinds bank loans of all kinds george selgin instead those savings are being shunted into mortgage backed securities and long term treasury bills which was the stuff the fed has been buying so that s an important change in the allocation of resources and the fed likes to not talk about what it used to say about this if you go back as recently as 2002 you find fed statements about how proud they are that among the central banks in the world they have one of the leanest balance sheets that is our monetary system operated with a relatively small central bank balance sheet precisely designed to make sure the fed wasn t soaking up immense amounts of private savings and the fed people said this is a good thing because we want to leave resource allocation the allocation of savings to the private sector why is that good well the presumption is that bank lending uses savings more productively banks could also buy government bonds but they presumably are looking for the most productive uses the greatest returns and that ultimately contributes to economic growth george selgin now the fed doesn t talk about that anymore they don t talk about lean balance sheets they talk about how liquid the banking system is david beckworth let me ask a question george selgin that s one of the several problems david beckworth let s come back to this but i m going to ask a question on that first critique some advocates would say you re right there s a bigger financial footprint they ll look at the federal reserve s earnings it s huge think of all the money it s sending to the federal government it s helping bring down the deficit why not why not have the fed operate as a huge large fixed income hedge fund george selgin well first of all the fedâ s remittances are not increased much by the policy of paying interest on excess reserves in fact on the contrary as a result of that new policy two things are true first interest is being paid on required reserves and since banks would have held those anyway that difference between paying interest on required reserves and not paying interest on required reserves is a net interest loss to the treasury that s a net interest loss as for excess reserves well the banks are getting the interest for the most part that s being generated by the extra assets that the fed has well then the question arises how come we had some very substantial remittances to the treasury which we did we had exceptionally large of course other things equal if the fed is earning any net interest at all it s going to earn a lot more with a 4 5 trillion balance sheet than it would be earning with an approximately 1 trillion balance sheet which is what it had before george selgin so yes you re bound to have some more remittances but most of the increases in remittances that people are talking about is just associated with a very temporary boost in remittances because the fed bought all these long term relatively high yielding treasury and mortgage back securities whereas before it bought lower yielding treasury bills and it didn t increase its interest payments on reserves to the bank s proportionately the interest rate on reserves was not as high as the interest yield on these long term securities however there s another side to that as interest rates have been rising of course the fed has had to take capital losses and now all those interest payments are going way down and they re going to keep going down the interest remittances to the treasury so that was just a rollercoaster ride that s not a long term increase and to the extent that it is a long term increase it s just because of a shift in the duration of the fed s balance sheet that s what s doing it and so we should not think this is a great windfall for the treasurys david beckworth it was a combination of the floor system with the large scale asset purchases going towards long term treasurys george selgin longer term treasurys with high relatively high yields and the fed not having to risk adjust its remittances to the treasury the treasury gets it all and then when the risk hits when the interest rates rise the treasury is going to get less david beckworth let s go back to the other critiques you have of the floor system george selgin well one of the other critiques has to do with the point i made earlier that it whereas in a corridor system banks are actively lending to each other overnight in this unsecured federal funds market in a floor system you ve shut that down now that actually matters a lot according to quite a few economists including at least one nobel prize winner who believe that the presence of this unsecured market the banks participate in all the time is extremely important for eliminating contagion risk that is the risk that that bank failures will spread throughout the system and the way it does that is banks that know they re going to participate in that market routinely have a strong incentive to do homework to decide which other banks they want to deal with so they have an incentive to learn which other banks are safe and which ones aren t and to keep their eye on the situation so that if anything develops anywhere in the banking system they re not gonna make any more loans overnight to any troubled bank george selgin so the overnight unsecured market is like the canary in the coal mine of bank insolvency problems anything that happens there any troubled bank will be shut out and that s from that fact information can flow to everybody about which banks are in trouble and what that does in practice is to really limit the spread of panic because if a bank is if you know that banks are lending to some other bank in the interbank market you know that bank is safe that s where the first sign of trouble will happen so you don t have to run on that bank or pull your money out of that bank other banks would if they do it then you ll want to do it but otherwise they re doing the homework to know who s naughty who s nice and all that when you shut that down there s no information now nobody s monitoring other banks who has a strong incentive to do so and that can create problems george selgin it s interesting that in all the other countries that have flirted with floor systems they have all with a prominent exception of the us and the uk they have all worried about this issue and most have abandoned floor systems and gone back to a corridor type systems of some sort because they did not want to have killed their interbank markets the fed is the only central bank that hasn t even discussed this they act like it s not an issue david beckworth so let me ask a follow up question related to this lack of price discovery or this information that s missing now that was formerly brought to us by the interbank market what is a substitute for what is the fed doing in place of that so we don t have that signal is there any kind of recourse in the floor system to kind of get around that problem george selgin i think the fed would say that part of the answer is well banks are sitting on so much liquidity that now we don t have to worry but of course that s not right for two reasons first the liquidity isn t evenly distributed most of the excess reserves that have flooded the system are being held in a handful of new york banks and branches of foreign banks other banks are sitting on extra reserves too because they can t borrow in the interbank market but they re not sitting on huge amounts their liquidity ratios haven t gone up sky high but even putting that aside liquidity isn t the same as solvency banks can still fail we ve heard that citibank is having problems again for example who knows with their track record but i wouldn t count on the presence of a bunch of excess reserves to solve the problem of bank failures and therefore to solve the risk of contagion effects and i fear that those effects are going to be multiplied now that we don t have banks at least keeping an eye on each other and they don t have the incentive to do it that they used to have david beckworth so what you re saying is we re substituting some notion of comfort in having large amounts of reserves but also regulators filling the role of the market here they are going in and inspecting bank balance sheets and we re trusting them george selgin oh well yes if you believe that that s a good substitute i have a bridge to sell you but no it s really not a good idea to remove incentives for bankers to keep well informed we ve already remember we ve removed the incentives for ordinary depositors to worry about which banks are safe and which ones aren t that we did with deposit insurance which now covers the vast majority of depositors so if banks aren t monitoring each other s riskiness nobody is and in order for them to have an incentive to do that they have to be dealing with other banks in markets where their dealings are not perfectly secured also and the fed funds market was the prime example of an unsecured interbank market and it is essentially moribund right now and has been for some years david beckworth now another critique you ve brought up in the past i ve heard you ve talked about is another political economy consideration and that is it creates a temptation for congress to rob the piggy bank george selgin oh yeah david beckworth tell us about that george selgin this one actually scares me more than the others do and they scare me plenty so in the old days the good old day tempted to say because there was a connection between the size of the fed s balance sheet on one hand and the stance of monetary policy on the other the fed couldn t monetize government deficits or buy securities from government and agencies willy nilly without promoting ultimately triggering inflation therefore the fed being an independent agency charged with dual mandate that includes limiting inflation had a powerful answer to special interests including the treasury to presidents who would say why don t you buy more of our debt and that answer was we can t we have a responsibility to avoid inflation and acquiring a large amount of your debt will ultimately trigger more inflation than we re supposed to allow and that was the answer very very good answer george selgin well they can t say it anymore because and we ve of course had a very good historical illustration of this the last few years but this continues to be good even at full employment now reserve creation doesn t change the stance of monetary policy therefore buying assets doesn t change the stance of policy that depends on the interest rate the fed pays on reserves the balance sheet can grow and grow and grow and there s no necessary inflationary consequence and that means that it s a free parameter it means the fed cannot say the size of the balance sheet is going to affect our monetary policy stance and then the question arises well then okay what determines how big your balance sheet should be who should decide and i believe the answer is all kinds of people are going to want to decide and that s not good george selgin and that means all kinds of special interest in government and out are going to want to try to influence the fed s decisions about the balance sheet and of course many of them seeking to sell securities are going to want the influence to be positive david beckworth but this is not just a theoretical concern you re alluding to some actual developments within the past few years where congress has tapped into the fed s balance sheet george selgin well yes and no congress tapped into the dividends that the fed pays its member banks david beckworth okay george selgin and that was a portent i think of the kind of thing that congress david beckworth could do george selgin is willing to try to do and now i see the balance sheet as a bit of a loose cannon up there where it is something that as soon as people understand that the fed no longer has any inflationary motive for fighting attempts to get it to buy this and that it s going to have a hard time resisting and knowing that people are going to put more pressure on it david beckworth but just to make this concrete i m thinking of examples for example maybe the state of illinois says hey we need a bail out i mean that would be a great example wouldn t it george selgin oh well i can give you a better example in a sense so we have donald trump complaining that the fed should not be raising interest rates partly perhaps mainly because that affects the terms in which the treasury is able to finance debt but he might just as well be moaning not about prices but about quantities he might be saying why don t you buy a lot more debt at the existing rate of interest and that would be a better tactic because the first complaint the fedâ s answer is no we re responsible for the stance of monetary policy so we have to set interest rates in order to meet our targets george selgin the second complaint it s have the well balanced sheet there is no answer there s no clear simple answer to the effect that buying more of the fedâ s the treasury securities will violate any of the fedâ s responsibilities the fed might not like it the fed may not want to do it though i m not even sure about that bureaucrats like big balance sheets but it would not have a clear it wouldn t contradict its mandate in a clear fashion for it to load up on more treasury securities and go from four trillion to six trillion or eight trillion of course it would have macroeconomic consequences at least if we believe the theories behind quantitative easing but we know that the inflation consequences could be very very muted david beckworth well let me bring up one last objection we ll move on to another part of this discussion but that is the bad optics it creates so the new chairwoman of the house financial services committee has said that she is really bothered by the interest on excess reserve payments to banks and in theory if those were equal to treasury rates it wouldn t really be a subsidy but at least it creates the image or perception of one do you see this being just another way of stirring up the hornet s nest i mean is it something that fed should be mindful of moving forward george selgin i think it is though the optics are bad not just because we now have banks earning interest for just sitting on reserves but because most of the banks that are earning that interest are six or seven new york banks and a handful of foreign bank branches and that doesn t look good to a lot of people but it must be said that this isn t really a subsidy those banks are financing the fedâ s big balance sheet that is the basis for the interest it s earning and then paying to them so they re like other savers in that sense the fed is saying if you put a we ll pay you interest you keep you hold on to our reserves that will allow us to finance a bigger balance sheet create and finance a bigger balance sheet so it s a sort of indian giving situation george selgin the fed creates reserves and pays the banks to hold on to them which is to say to lend that much back to the fed so the banks are not really in a sense they re not getting something for nothing nevertheless it does look bad and the optics are not very good i don t want to hang my criticism of the floor system on merely optical phenomenon that is illusions i want to hone in on what i think are the genuine and very serious flaws of the system but i think the optics are certainly something the fed officials would be unwise not to consider david beckworth all right so let s look to the future now there was a survey that was conducted of the senior financial officers in banking systems and they suggest that they would be willing to depart with enough reserves till they got to an aggregate number near 900 billion and i m extrapolating it s actually 600 million but if you extrapolate to all the banks you 900 so close to a george selgin or 1 2 actually david beckworth well close let s say it s a rounded trillion around number right now the reserves are around 1 6 1 7 so at the rate that the fed is shrinking its balance sheet we could be there pretty soon if we assume that number is the amount that they re going to hold them at or what we could find overnight market rates jump above interest rates its reserves it could be a few years if the fed decides to go even lower than that it d be longer but do you see the fed just continuing on autopilot with this balance sheet shrinking down down down until by default they trigger a corridor system george selgin well that s a little tricky because no they won t trigger a corridor system they won t go to that extent i don t believe that ll happen my personal guess for some time now is that the balance sheet we ll never get below 3 trillion and may not get much below 3 5 trillion which is not still david beckworth how about the overall balance sheet or the reserve george selgin the overall balance sheet david beckworth okay george selgin now i m not sure i have to think about how many i think that that translates into about a 1 5 trillion of reserves or 1 2 something like that david beckworth not much more reduction than in the balance sheet george selgin no but it won t be because they ve triggered a floor system it will be because there s certain pressures in the money markets and some banks may be a little shorter reserves and they ll use that as a reason to stop the balance sheet reduction well before anything cataclysmic or gigantic happens i don t think they want it to be that small to begin with and they re just anxious to have an excuse to stop the unwind prematurely but i don t think that what the bankers say is the limited amount how low they d be happy to see the system go you can t go by those survey numbers because of problems of a fallacy of composition right each individual bank says well i would be unhappy to hold less than this et cetera but it all depends on what other banks are doing and if all banks are aiming for the same thing first of all there are many cases where they canâ t all have it and then there are situations where what the banks want will depend on the fed s policy reactions george selgin clearly if we have a corridor system if you said to banks how many reserves would you want if you could readily borrow in the overnight market without any difficulty they would answer differently than they do when they know that that market is constrained so the survey doesn t really tell us anything it tells us about some of the bankers beliefs and those beliefs are all perfectly reasonable by the way they agree with my priors but it doesn t give the fed its marching orders on what its ultimate goal for reducing system reserve should be the fed cannot draw any meaningful conclusion about that optimal value job by polling bankers david beckworth well i would mention this survey does also say near the end a different scenario how low would overnight market rates have to go relative excuse me how high would they have to go relative to the interest and excess reserves so if the fed allowed market rates to go above ioer and banks in that situation begin to change their story a little bit they re willing to part with more george selgin that s right all the answers in the survey makes sense they re all reasonable answers if i were a banker i think i would have answered similarly but the fed has to it has to be careful what policy conclusions it draws on the basis of those answers and the public has to be careful not to necessarily swallow the fedâ s arguments when it points to the surveys or reason for doing this that or the other thing david beckworth what about international experience you ve alluded to them already but we ve got a neighbor to the north who tried the floor system for a brief period and they went back to a corridor what can we learn from these other countries using these systems george selgin a general rule regarding canada is that we should try to do more things the way they do them we should have done it in the 19th century and now we should try to do it today canada floored with a floor system during the crisis but it was for a very short period of time they went to a floor and then they went back to a corridor which as i said earlier something that in a corridor system you occasionally might have crises where you do that that s fine that s part of our corridor system works but they never pumped up preserves on such fast to scale as we did in the united states even proportionately speaking they usually operated with very few reserves the canadian central bank was actually a leaner meaner central bank than the fed in that regard and now they ve gone back to being lean george selgin and it was it was a good example of using a floor temporarily in the middle of a crisis but not sticking to it whereas in the us our story of how we got to the floor system is absolutely incredible if you don t want to read about the floor system for any other reason you should read about how and why the fed turned to it in october 2008 but it was all about tightening monetary policy or not wanting to loosen policy and this was at a time when the us economy was circling the bowl so to speak and they started paying banks to hoard reserves because they didn t want interest rates to fall any lower of course that was a futile effort but they were trying to prop them up and this only made the this is the point about saying that it deepened the recession implementing a floor system deepened the recession was a wrong policy at the wrong time david beckworth what about other central banks like the european central bank what are they doing and any lessons from them george selgin we can t learn much from the european central bank they have resorted to negative interest rates so i have several other central banks and there s some something to be said for negative rates if you can do it but we can learn i think from new zealand and the bank of japan what a lot of countries have done actually that s interesting i m not saying this is a good policy but it s a good answer to that liquidity requirement they have so called tier systems where they said okay we ll pay banks to hold reserves up to a certain fixed amount but any reserves that the excess reserves they have beyond that we re not going to make it attractive for them to hold it in that way they can have a certain extra cushion of liquidity and reserves that they introduced banks to hold but at the margin if the central bank creates more reserves the banks don t have any incentive to hoard them and that means that interest rates can still be controlled the old fashion way in those systems even though you have this extra liquidity george selgin i don t think we need to do that i think we ve already got reserved requirements now there s a new basel liquidity coverage ratio that we enforce there s no reason to have any further devices for encouraging banks to sit on reserves we already have a suspender and a belt we certainly don t need anything more david beckworth can you speak briefly to the liquidity coverage ratio you just mentioned how does it complicate any transition away from the floor system george selgin so this is a new basel innovation that resembles other basel regulatory innovations in at least one respect which is that it s stupid but what it is a new so called liquidity coverage ratio that s based on a complicated formula but it basically says that banks have to hold a certain percentage of so called high quality liquid assets and there are two different tiers or types of liquid assets and they have to hold certain amounts of each based on their liquidity needs which are measured by outflows and how much what kinds of assets they have and the volatility and it s very very complicated but for our purposes there s one essential thing that has to be made clear about this people have said well we might as well stick to a floor system because under the new liquidity coverage ratio requirements banks have to hold a lot of reserves which are high quality liquid assets and they couldn t dispense with them even if we didn t pay interest on reserves because of this new requirement george selgin so they re essentially arguing that there s no going back to a corridor type system with or without interest on reserves given these new requirements well that s just wrong because treasury securities among other things also are high quality liquid assets now what these commentators have said is yes but look the banks seem to be lately preferring reserves they d rather have reserves reserves are better but that s not true in fact it s becoming obviously untrue lately but banks had been preferring to hold reserves to meet their liquidity coverage ratios but that s because the interest rate on reserves was being kept above the rate of return on short term treasury securities in a corridor system that wouldn t be so so they would prefer a treasury security george selgin well there s a twist to this i wrote about this the other day because apparently federal reserve officials have told their supervisors to tell the banks that they want them to hold some definite amount of reserves use a definite amount of reserves to meet liquidity coverage requirements even though the requirements themselves don t call for that so it seems that the fed is using their supervisory its supervisory powers to create an artificial demand for reserves that would make going back to a corridor hard but that s purely an arbitrary regulatory discretionary action that has nothing to do with any official existing regulation and this is sort of thing fed people do all the time they tell their regulators you tell this bank to do this or to not do that and it doesn t matter if there s a law or not the bankers are going to do what their supervisors tell them to do unless they re big new york banks then they tell the supervisors what to do david beckworth well in that very cynical note i want to step back because this whole discussion is very much in the weeds it s very technical i want to step back pull back and ask maybe more general question so this system you ve argued in the book and elsewhere it leads to kind of a low inflationary environment it kind of throttles back with the creation of money assets it has an effect on the level of inflation nominal spending in the economy and so my question is is this turned to a floor system a symptom more than a cause is this more of an epiphenomenon is it reflecting the fedâ s desire for low inflation environment notice the fed is so committed to low inflation that it by default had it turned to something like a floor system in 2008 and if the answer s yes isn t the real issue the monetary regime versus getting caught up in the operating system itself george selgin well no there are two different issues one issue was the stance of monetary policy that always matters and you can get that wrong in a floor system or a corridor system you have that money too tight or too loose in either system so we all agree and we should have monetary policy just right is anybody against that no okay see how easy monetary policyâ so that s a question of the stance of monetary policy of where you set as it where the interest rate that you re controlling that s standing for the monetary policy stands now the problem in 2008 for example is it was really that the monetary policy stance was too tight but the introduction of a floor system and interest on reserves was the device by which they implemented this overly tight policy which weren t able to do otherwise and been for interest on reserves george selgin the fed was creating a lot of reserves through emergency lending et cetera before quantitative easing and that would have naturally loosened monetary policy turns out that would ve been a good thing in retrospect in retrospect we know what spending was collapsing then now and the fed use this turned to a floor system to put a stop to it so it didn t have to in principle in a floor system there s always an interest rate that s the right interest rate it just so happens that that fed policy back then was dedicated to keeping interest rates higher than they should have been and used the floor system to do it now the problem to me that s distinct the problems that are distinct to a floor system are separate from the problems of getting monetary policy right george selgin and they have to do with killing the interbank market bank monitoring they have to do with a gigantic instead of lean balance sheet and the inefficient use of savings that results from that they have to do with the political economy of a balance sheet that s not obviously the business of the size of which is not obviously a matter of monetary policy and so must be a matter of something and with optics of the sort you mentioned those those i think are the real issues with the floor system it may be that there are some technical respects in which a floor system makes it harder to pursue monetary goals and i think there s something to that and i ll give you an example of it throw out an example of it but i don t think those are the main issues george selgin the sense in which i think a floor system does pose challenges for monetary policy because it relies only on interest rates on prices rather than quantities in the old system right if you wanted to ease monetary policy just talk about that you throw more reserves in the system the banks have reserves that are excess they don t want to hold on to them and interest rates are going to fall because the banks are going to then turn around and place those reserves in short term markets including the fed funds market but notice here that the easing of monetary policy involves not just changes in interest rates but essentially involves spending lending and ultimately growth of broader monetary aggregates in the new regime the interest rates are changed but quantities aren t changed and some people believe that it makes a difference for what ultimately happens for whether inflation goes up for whether spending goes up for what happens to other kinds of economic activity george selgin and i think that i think they re on to something so i do think there s a problem with this mechanism for monetary control quite apart from the other issues i ve raised nevertheless i think we should be clear about what are problems unique to a floor system and what are problems that are related to having a bad monetary policy stance david beckworth all right well thank you george we will now turn to the audience and i ll take questions for george and just a few guidelines in terms of asking questions please wait to be called on wait for the microphone identify yourself and please stick to a question not a speech or a statement i ll start up here first i think i ve got a question in the front norbert michel norbert michel heritage foundation george do you see any sort of catalyst any sort of event that would be served as a catalyst to changing this system at all and if so what would be needed to change that system do we need this in other words is legislation going to be needed to change to revert back to a corridor system or do you see the fed just doing this on their own after being pressured or am i just way off here because i m thinking of this as a fed with an administration that is interested in an infrastructure sort of a program for lack of a better term and i m just wondering where this might go george selgin well i think there are two ways in which we might end up going back to a corridor system one is by persuading important people at the fed that that s something they should be considering and i do think there are people at the fed who are open minded though i think they re not enough of them and there s a lot of persuading yet to be done so the optimistic view is we just keep talking about this and get the fed to talk about it and maybe they ll see things they ll see things the way i see them that would be nice on the other hand i do think there s a role for legislation but it s really a rather minor role because if you read the current statute on interest on reserves it really doesn t allow a floor system or it barely allows a floor system george selgin if you go by the spirit of the thing yet the fed has used it has interpreted in a way that that allows it to use it to support a floor system what i mean is the original 2006 law that grants the fed the ability to pay interest on reserves and was put into early effect in 2008 by a separate piece of legislation specifically says that the interest rate on reserves is not to exceed the general level of short term interest rates now in a floor system the interest rate on reserves is generally and in our system has almost always been above many short term rates including the federal funds rate which is an overnight rate and but it s been over for most of the history not very recently but for most of the history of the floor system it s even been higher than one year treasury bill rates so and which are not a really short term george selgin so what the fed did in 2015 taking advantage of the wonderful notion of chevron deference the details of which are not worth going into especially before dinner but basically they got to write up the rules about how the statute would be implemented and for that purpose they said the short term interest rates will be defined as and then they included in the rates as consisting of rates like and then they included a bunch of longer term rates term rates instead of overnight rates but the kicker was they said and the fedâ s primary credit rate now the primary credit rate is the official rate name for what we call the discount rate and the federal reserve as a matter of policy sets the primary credit rate way above and you can read this in the federal reserve boardâ s publications the primary rate is set above the general level of short term interest rates george selgin now if you re following all this what this means is that the fed can abide according to its own interpretation of the statute it can set the interest rate on reserves at a level that doesn t exceed the general level of short term interest rates by setting it below an interest rate it also administers that s always way above the general level of short term interest rates got it so if i were to recommend congress provide a nudge to get the fed to consider going back to the floor system i would have it do so by simply saying no you can t interpret the statute that way let us tell you exactly what we meant and that would force the fed to either abandon the floor system or do some more illegal fancy footwork david beckworth all right i believe this gentleman here was next doug carr hi i m doug carr with r street isn t one of the big issues with the balance sheet that goes with the floor system the changes in it have such a destabilizing impact on the financial markets during the crisis they actually sold 600 billion from their portfolio in a short period of time coincided exactly with the stock market fall and with the drying up of repo money then they go into qe and we all know what happened with stocks and qe now we ve got qt net the central banks are taking more money out than they re putting in and obviously it s been tough sledding since that happened george selgin yeah you re referring to the taper tantrum right and that first example doug carr recently the powellâ george selgin yes yeah and that one too it s true that that any big change in the fed s balance sheet is going to be destabilizing that of course would also have been true under the old system the difference is the scale of potential changes of potential asset sales now or purchases is much vaster and so the potential for the fed to do mischief by messing around with its balance sheet is very great so that is a problem with the huge balance sheet and indirectly you could say a problem with the floor system though it must be said that if anything right now the fed officials are too timid about selling assets or unwinding their balance sheet i wrote an article called â operation snail â criticizing there balance sheet reduction plan i think at the time they hadn t started yet but snail stood for â stall now and inch along later â i think they could have been more aggressive than that but you re right that it can be very bad if they are too aggressive in reducing their assets david beckworth all right we had a question in the front row gary towns george great book gary towns and just a person david beckworth we like people it s good to have one or two gary towns now bernanke was famous for dismissing any policy practical problem that came out of the policy is idiosyncratic and i m just curious whether you ve looked at what happened to interbank lending abroad particularly in the libor markets with the crisis these fell apart they then morphed into banks really we re required to continue to be able to provide an interbank rate even if the marks weren t good this then translated into allegations at least they had mispriced and that then became suits and it became large monetary results and i m just curious whether you ve looked at that as well george selgin well there s issues wrapped up in that question gary one is what the libor scandal itself really was what was involved in it and the other is what exactly was going on in these interbank markets during the crisis as for the first i think you alluded to the reality that the bankers involved in this scandal well the real scandal isn t that they manipulated libor the real scandal is that they were told to do what they did by government officials who then went got to all ethical on them but it really was the bankers who were told during the crisis we don t want markets to panic we need to be quote rates blah blah blah blah blah and that s really the story behind the story of the libor thing george selgin for us the more fundamental question is was what was going on in 2008 and what was happening to activity on these markets i can talk with more authority about the fed funds market than i can about libor but in doing so will allow me to address a criticism that s been made of my points of my arguments it has been said that the reason interbank lending crashed in 2008 was not because of interest on reserves but because of panic that suddenly banks didn t trust each other and that s why they pulled out and there s some truth to that but it s a small part of the true story of course there was a panic and for a while and you could detect this with something called the ted spread and but that subsided very quickly for a couple of reasons but one of which the lesser well known is that the government stepped in and said we re going to guarantee all these interbank loans george selgin so whether you like that policy or not counterparty risk was no longer after that step which lasted for a year or so it was no longer driving activity or determining activity in the fed funds market which nevertheless never recovered so if you want to know why that activity never recovered you can t appeal to the risk it had to be something else that something else was the fed s interest payments on reserves and so it isn t the case that we can t restore an active interbank market just by not paying so much interest on bank reserves as there s no evidence for that gary towns we referred what you do here as the great recession of 2008 and nine you also have in your book good discussion of 1893 and 1907 why wasn t this described and why isn t it typically as it appears to me to have been a panic george selgin oh i don t know you re referring to my other book money free and unfree and by the way this one s different and i don t think i mentioned those other i think you could call a 2008 a panic it was certainly a panic on certain markets who knows how these names some people do call david beckworth i think some people do call it the great financial crisis and others call the great recession george selgin great financial crisis panic maybe seems to have a little bit of an old fashioned sound to it somehow i don t know but strictly speaking i don t know why you couldn t call it a panic it was certainly a panic the central bankers were panicking among other people david beckworth well i ll be old fashioned here myself and call the time i think we re out of time however we have a reception afterwards for all the unanswered questions george is dying to hear them and eager to engage you so let s give a hand for george george selgin thank you all and if it got too weedy the book is perhaps clearer than i am i hope so david beckworth okay listeners here is a quick update on january 19 just a few days after the recording the fedâ s federal open market committee or fomc decided they would stick with their floor system the fomc had been discussing the future of its operating system during the past few meetings and the tone of these discussions was decidedly pro floor system so it was not a surprise to see them make a decision in favor of the floor system david beckworth this decision though not surprising is debatable first as george selgin mentioned in the show this decision makes the fedâ s balance sheet an attractive temptation for congress and the president the fedâ s balance sheet now amounts to a piggy bank that can be tapped without worries that it will create inflation after all the whole point of a floor system is to separate the size of the central bankâ s balance sheet from the stance of monetary policy david beckworth second one of the big motivations behind the fomcâ s decision was its belief that the floor system creates better interest rate control however the bank of canada shows that a symmetric interest rate corridor operating system provides great interest rate control in fact in terms of overnight repo rates the bank of canada has actually done a better job keeping rates on target with its corridor system than the fed with its floor system david beckworth third and finally as peter stella explained on last weekâ s episode the large stock of excess reserves amounts to a poor form of debt management by the u s government excess reserves are very similar to treasury bills except that only banks and few other financial firms can use them everyone can use treasury bills the fed has effectively taken on part of the treasuryâ s role as u s public debt manager and done so in a relatively inefficient manner i suspect this decision will not be the end of this debate david beckworth macro musings is produced by the mercatus

use of non gaap financial measures by centerpoint energy in providing guidance in addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap including presentation of income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share centerpoint energy also provides guidance based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure centerpoint energy s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share respectively the impact of zens and related securities and mark to market gains or losses resulting from the company s energy services business centerpoint energy s guidance for 2019 also does not reflect certain impacts associated with the vectren merger which are integration and transaction related fees and expenses including severance and other costs to achieve anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger and merger financing impacts in january prior to the completion of the merger due to the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund the merger that resulted in higher net interest expense and higher common stock share count centerpoint energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of zens and related securities and mark to market gains or losses resulting from the company s energy services business are not estimable as they are highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management s control these excluded items along with the excluded impacts associated with the merger could have a material impact on gaap reported results for the applicable guidance period management evaluates the company s financial performance in part based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share management believes that presenting these non gaap financial measures enhances an investor s understanding of centerpoint energy s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods the adjustments made in these non gaap financial measures exclude items that management believes does not most accurately reflect the company s fundamental business performance these excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release where applicable centerpoint energy s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share non gaap financial measures should be considered as a supplement to and not as a substitute for or superior to income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share which respectively are the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures

28 02 2019 listen a report by the bank of ghana bog that assesses the impact of external shocks on ghana s economy has revealed the cedi s depreciation against the us is expected to continue throughout the year as global events show more external threats ahead the report titled the effect of external conditions on the economy of ghana is authored by philip abradu otoo and bernard jagre walley of the bog s research department it says an expected slowdown in the u s and chinese economies alongside policy rate hikes in the u s strengthening of the and higher crude oil prices will all impact ghana s economy negatively leading to a significant deterioration in the exchange rate the slow down of the world s two biggest economies will dampen growth in emerging and developing economies including ghana which will result in capital outflows whereas policy rate hikes in the us will attract investors also triggering capital outflows from ghana to the u s and resulting in high demand for the dollar while a surge in oil prices will although stabilising growth further increase inflation which will also culminate in a sharp depreciation of the cedi the results show that a simultaneous slowdown in the world s two largest economies will dampen gdp growth in ghana induce a significant deterioration in the exchange rate and induce a marginal increase in the domestic inflation rate and a sharp rise in interest rates it further says a surge in oil prices leads to a relatively stable gdp growth inflation declines initially but picks up marginally after three quarters while the exchange rate depreciates sharply the report states commenting on the report financial analyst dr richmond atuahene told the b ft that the local currency s future looks gloomy if you look at the currency depreciation it doesn t look good it may depreciate more than 15 per cent this year and once the interest rate in america goes up people will disinvest their bonds and rather go and invest in the u s and this will definitely put pressure on the cedi so all the report is saying is that it doesn t look good from the currency point of view he said the report further shows that about 40 per cent of the variation in ghana s real gdp growth is accounted for by external influences what this essentially means is that any activity be it positive or negative which happens with ghana s trading partner countries can affect economic growth by 40 per cent an economist at the university of cape coast professor john gatsi said this shows how integrated the country s economy is with other economies and should not be a cause for worry when situations are favourable the activities in those economies will help you also develop because when they are doing well they will invest in other countries but when something negative is happening to them it will affect you for example we are supposed to receive some us 2billion from china if the economic situation does not support their ability to give you that us 2billion it will not come so it is explaining our linkage with some economies he said the report recommends that policymakers should implement measures that can absorb some of the external shocks to mitigate their effect on the local economy the results thus imply that external factors play an important role in the ghanaian economy domestic fundamentals may either act to amplify or dampen the impact of these external developments on the ghanaian economy policymakers should therefore continue to improve the macro fundamentals to dampen the effects of external shocks on the ghanaian economy it proposes measures like fiscal discipline reduction in external debt building forex buffers continuing with the ongoing disinflation process and appropriate monetary policy measures to stabilise the economy in the long term promoting exports would help to reduce the pressure on the cedi the report states source b ft

represents a 241 million increase versus prior year driven by reduced interest expense improved capital efficiency and higher operating margins outlook for fiscal 2019 the guidance for full year 2019 includes the impact from the implementation of accounting standards codification asc 842 leases which became effective january 1 2019 under this new standard the balance sheet will be grossed up to show a right of use asset and correlated right of use liability for operating leases the impact to our income statement is expected to be approximately 13 million of additional rent expense in 2019 related to certain build to suit arrangements that are currently treated as capital leases on our books but will be classified as operating leases upon implementation of asc 842 conversely the approximately 75 million of debt recorded for those leases will be eliminated based on the current foreign exchange spot rates2 laureate currently expects its pro forma performance for full year 2019 to be as follows continuing operations total enrollments to be approximately 890 000 growth of roughly 2 revenues to be in the range of 3 350 to 3 385 million growth of 2 3 on an organic constant currency basis adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 645 to 655 million growth of 7 8 on an organic constant currency basis and prior to the impact from implementation of asc 842 which will cause a 2 year over year unfavorable impact on growth and throughout 2019 as our announced asset sales are completed we expect that we will continue to reduce g a costs we expect those cost reductions to be completed by the end of 2019 thus we anticipate adjusted ebitda for year end 2019 to be between 670 680 million on a run rate basis consolidated operations capital expenditures at approximately 6 of revenue free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures expected to be approximately 145 million for 2019 and with the expected g a cost reduction we expect free cash flow to be approximately 170 million for 2019 on a run rate basis and we expect to end 2019 with approximately 800 million in net debt factoring in 1 5 billion net proceeds anticipated from asset sales in 2019 2 based on actual fx rates for january february 2019 and current spot fx rates local currency per us dollar of mxn 19 39 brl 3 76 clp 666 00 pen 3 34 for march december 2019 fx impact may change

expectations beliefs plans objectives assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are or may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws which involve risks and uncertainties laureate s actual results may vary significantly from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements you can identify forward looking statements because they contain words such as believes expects may will should seeks approximately intends plans estimates or anticipates or similar expressions that concern our strategy plans or intentions all statements we make relating to i guidance including but not limited to total enrollments revenues adjusted ebitda costs capital expenditures cash interest expense free cash flow and reported earnings per share ii the impact from the implementation of asc 842 and iii our planned divestitures are forward looking statements in addition we through our senior management from time to time make forward looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments all of these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time and therefore our actual results may differ materially from those we expected we derive most of our forward looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts which are based upon many detailed assumptions while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and of course it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in our annual report on form 10 k filed with the sec on february 28 2019 these forward looking statements speak only as of the time of this release and we do not undertake to publicly update or revise them whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law presentation of non gaap measures in addition to the results provided in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap throughout this press release laureate provides the non gaap measurements of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we have included these non gaap measurements because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long term operational plans adjusted ebitda consists of income loss from continuing operations adjusted for the items included in the accompanying reconciliation the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for period to period comparisons of our core business additionally adjusted ebitda is a key input into the formula used by the compensation committee of our board of directors and our chief executive officer in connection with the payment of incentive compensation to our executive officers and other members of our management team accordingly we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors free cash flow consists of operating cash flow minus capital expenditures free cash flow provides a useful indicator about laureate s ability to fund its operations and repay its debts laureate s calculations of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are not necessarily comparable to calculations performed by other companies and reported as similarly titled measures these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results each of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow is reconciled from the respective measures under gaap in the attached table non gaap reconciliations about laureate education inc laureate education inc is the largest international network of

segment now let s pivot our review to the fourth quarter segment performance our teams managed well through challenging pricing markets trade disruptions and a slow recovery from our extended downtime at diamond green diesel during the third quarter the feed segment benefited from robust raw material supplies globally but battled stagnant and deflationary finished pricing for fats and proteins as compared to 2017 clearly our extended shut down at diamond green diesel and ample palm oil supplies weighed on the fat markets proteins continue to feel the trade disruptions related to china and the record slaughter volumes global pricing is improving across the fats and protein markets and we feel quite confident that our future results will portray this fact our specialty ingredients business embedded in the feed segment continues to perform well reporting strong margins and record volumes our acquisition of triple t wet pet a specialty pet food operation in springdale arkansas added to our footprint and our market share in this growing market also we are excited about the progress of enviroflight our joint venture with intrexon this is the largest black soldier fly protein facility in the us and phase one production commenced in the fourth quarter and during the quarter we also acquired a new organic fertilizer production facility in turlock california which will enable us to grow our production of nature safe organic fertilizer now our food segment anchored by our global collagen business rebounded nicely and posted a solid quarter both rousselot south america and china reported a strong year and 2019 looks to be off to a very good start peptan our specialty collagen product is rising to meet global demand and achieved record production levels with further expansion within our operations in brazil and france expected to come online during the first half of this year our fuel segment which is a combination of our green energy businesses delivered consistent earnings on strong volumes across europe ecoson our european bioenergy business capitalized on higher volumes from phase one expansion of the digester in denderleeuw belgium and the return of our netherlands facility to full capacity after being curtailed for most of 2017 rendac our european disposal rendering business also had a solid quarter generating strong volumes and earnings growth in the netherlands and belgium despite the absence of the blender s tax credit our biodiesel businesses remain steady compared to last year and they were benefiting from the lower fat prices in the fourth quarter diamond green diesel displayed its true potential the facility resumed production and quickly ramped up to its boilerplate capacity of 275 million gallons per year for the quarter we produced 73 million gallons of renewable diesel delivering a record 110 million of ebitda on 66 million gallons of sales operating margins were a 1 67 a gallon for the quarter and averaged a 1 19 for the full year for 2019 we anticipate operate at or above nameplate capacity and we expect full year margins to be in the 1 25 to 1 40 per gallon range diamond green diesel continues to capitalize on the premium lcfs markets and the jv generated partner dividends of 40 million each in the quarter construction on our phase three super diamond expansion is already under way and when complete it will produce an additional 400 million gallons of renewable diesel and 50 to 60 gallons of renewable naphtha the estimated cost of the facility is around 1 1 billion and we anticipate start up in the latter half of 2021 on monday i visited the facility and one slide 10 of our earnings call presentation you will see the progress as we prepare the sight permits are pending and we are anxiously awaiting the start of construction now with respect to the btc we remain optimistic congress will provide a legislative vehicle to renew and extend the btc during 2019 as you may or may not know the btc is part of 28 extenders that congress has not renewed from all of our visits to the hill we can report that bipartisan discussions are under way to move this issue forward now before i turn the call over to brad i d like to revisit a point on the valero fourth quarter earnings conference call during that call the credit suisse analyst asked the value of darling ingredients and valero maintaining the diamond green diesel partnership martin parrish valero s senior vice president of alternative fuels did a great job in answering that question when he explained how integral darling is to the partnership i d like to paraphrase his answer because i think it s valuable for our shareholders and analysts to keep top of mind martin states darling is one of the largest processors of animals fats and used cooking oil in the world in fact darling processes over 10 of the world s meat industry by products annually in doing so we have created a raw materials supply chain to support diamond green diesel that will be very hard and very expensive to recreate and it would be complicated to maintain a stand alone supply network without the balance of our food and feed businesses working in concert with the supply chain darling has unique expertise in pretreating the fats and oil feedstocks to optimize the refining process which valero has immense expertise in valero brings their unrivaled skill in engineering and operating a state of the art renewable diesel refinery as well as marketing operations that ensure the partnership maximizes its unique position to the lcfs markets around the world martin and i both agree that diamond green diesel is truly more valuable with both companies involved due to our combined innovation and expertise so with that i d like to turn it over to brad to give you a few financial highlights brad phillips executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thanks randy for the fourth quarter 2018 we reported consolidated net sales of 853 1 million compared 952 5 million for the comparable 2017 period for fiscal 2018 net sales were 3 4 billion compared to 3 7 billion for fiscal 2017 these declines were primarily a factor of lower finished fat product pricing the closing of the company s hurlingham argentina facility the deconsolidation of the company s besthides subsidiary during 2018 reclassed billed freight recorded in cost of sales in 2018 as compared to net sales in 2017 and the divestiture of our industrial residuals business earlier this year we posted net income in q4 of 40 6 million or 0 24 per diluted share compared to net income of 105 7 million or 0 63 per diluted share for the 2017 fourth quarter fiscal 2018 net income was 101 5 million or 0 60 per diluted share compared to 128 5 million or 0 77 per diluted share for fiscal 2017 the declines of net income were primarily driven by an income tax expense of 8 million and 12 million in the fourth quarter of 18 and fiscal 18 respectively compared to income tax benefits of 85 million and 69 2 million in the 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 respectively due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities per the us tax cuts and jobs act and benefits from european tax reform additionally in fiscal 2018 we had debt extinguishment costs argentina restructuring costs and a loss on the sale of the industrial residual sector substantially offsetting these declines as reflected in our substantial increase in income before income taxes for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 was a significant increase in out equity and net income of our unconsolidated subsidiary diamond green diesel which was partially due to recording the 2017 blender s tax credit in 2018 sg a was 76 4 million and 309 3 million for the 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively compared to 89 9 million and 343 5 million for the 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively the decrease was primarily due to lower wages and benefits which were partially due to the closure of the argentina collagen facility and the sale of the industrial residual sector both in the second quarter of 2018 interest expense declined 2 5 million year over year primarily due to a lower interest rate on the company s 515 million senior notes resulting from the may 2018 refinancing of the notes from 5 75 to 3 625 i want to briefly mention taxes the company reported income tax expense of 12 million for fiscal year 2018 the effective tax rate is 10 2 which differs from the statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the biofuel tax incentive for 2017 recorded in 2018 tax law changes in the netherlands and changes in valuation allowances primarily related to losses that provided no tax benefit the biofuel tax incentive expired as of the end of fiscal 17 excluding the impact of the 2017 biofuel tax incentive and tax law changes the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 is 34 4 cash tax payments were 33 2 million in 2018 compared to 26 3 million in 2017 we are projecting the fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate to be 35 excluding the biofuel tax incentive if the tax incentive is reenacted retroactively for fiscal year 2018 the effective tax rate is projected to be 20 finally we are projecting cash taxes of approximately 40 million for fiscal 2019 now as for the balance sheet working capital improved by 10 5 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and capital expenditures for 2018 totaled 322 million compared to 274 2 million in 2017 we received 65 million in cash dividends from diamond green diesel during 2018 and our total debt to ebitda ratio per the bank covenants improved to 3 13 from 3 47 at the end of 17 our liquidity remains strong with approximately 929 8 million available under our revolving credit facility with that i ll turn it back over to you randy randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer hey thanks brad overall we are pleased with the achievements for the quarter and the year we took several strategic actions to mitigate global macro challenges and continued to focus on opportunities to optimize our platform strengthen our financial position and leverage and grow our scale to capture opportunities and deliver on our world of growth strategy our strong free cash flow allowed us to deploy 322 million of maintenance and growth capital with an additional 108 million of strategic acquisitions to build upon our sustainable portfolio of value added and specialty ingredients in 2019 we expect to invest approximately 300 million in maintenance and growth capital for several strategic projects noted in our slide deck while maintaining capital discipline across the company additionally we continue to take pride in our on going corporate social responsibility disclosure making significant achievements that demonstrate our commitment to drive meaningful progress toward a cleaner safer and sustainable environment towards this end we are showing specific updates on our website such as our latest video animation highlighting our biofuel stories at diamond green diesel if you haven t already watched the video i encourage you to do so also we continue to strengthen our corporate governance with the recent appointment of nicole ringenberg as a director nicole s appointment aligns well without governance strategy and after a 32 year career with monsanto she brings unique and strategic insights related to sustainable agricultural solutions global operations and with a strong emphasis on asia corporate finance and advancing diversity across our workforce we look forward to providing more updates on our on going environment social and governance effort across the company with that in summary we re excited about the strength of our business our future market position and our near term and long term growth opportunities so with that let s go ahead and open it up to questions please questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press then 1 on your touchtone phone if you re using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your questions please press then 2 our first question comes from heather jones of vertical group please go ahead heather jones vertical group analyst good morning everyone randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer good morning heather brad phillips executive vice president and chief financial officer morning heather jones vertical group analyst i have just a couple of questions randy you mentioned that global fat pricing has started to improve and i just was wondering if you could take us through how you view the cadence of the year because as you know there s a number of mandate increases around the world but palm oil production remains strong and all so how are you thinking about what that price curve looks throughout the year randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer we ve had a lot of discussion around the table on that coming out of december into january it felt pretty weak throughout the world we saw some pretty big softening happen in europe which is usually pretty steady but now here in january and into february we ve seen europe start to bounce back the us was a main driver here we just kinda had a hangover from that extended downtime at diamond green diesel and then the slaughter here has been around record levels and we expect it to remain record levels and with cheaper feed grains and inputs you tend to put more weight on the animals so at the end of the day there s ample supplies here but we re starting to see them move up for the first time we re seeing some strength on the west coast in our fats now we re also starting to see europe come back europe will be much stronger i believe in second quarter than first so i think it s a pretty strong bell curve here if you follow the palm oil kinda reports and predictions they re at the peak of their production and then it starts to scale down as you go forward here and at the end of the day i think you re gonna produce less fat in china this year than you have in the past and so i think the s d and the global balance sheet would continue to tighten as we go forward and we ll just see what happens so right now we re pretty bullish the back end of the year here heather jones vertical group analyst okay thank you been thinking about the blender s tax credit so you expressed confidence that it gets reinstated let s consider a scenario where it doesn t and given the higher advance mandate and the boho spread is not nearly as favorable as it was last year where do you think rend need to go to stimulate the kind of production we would need for those mandates john bullock executive vice president and chief strategy officer yeah heather this is john overall if we don t see the blender s tax credit come back then you would anticipate that we would see higher end prices develop as we go through the course of the year how quickly that ll happen who knows but it certainly looks like it needs to move to a higher level to be able to set the type of production that there is demand for out there now heather jones vertical group analyst okay thank you so much operator our next question comes from ken zaslow of bank of montreal please go ahead kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst hey good morning everyone randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken brad phillips executive vice president and chief financial officer morning kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst with the accent or for the time being the btc how should we think about the near term profitability of the feed segment yellow grease prices used cooking oil how do you think about that randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer i m gonna talk sequentially ken we saw a small our tonnage between q3 and q4 was bigger in q4 and pricing on the fats was even lower proteins were pretty stagnant if you will out there the west coast proteins continue to be pretty weak and european proteins backed off quite a bit during the quarter we re starting to see that all turn around and i don t know that i would tie any of that to the btc we re seeing the animal fats move up a little bit here in the us and clearly there s a spread used cooking oil s a pretty substantial premium to yellow grease or animal fats in the us i think the world s ramping up again on biofuels around there and i think we ll see some pretty good strength coming on here as we go forward so my anticipation is that the feed segment will start to show some improvement here in q1 and more in q2 and gonna get much stronger in q3 q4 for us kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst and can you just go through your capex projects and the returns that you expect to have in 2019 and 2020 how do we think about the incremental because it sounds like you have a lot of projects going on and just what s the incremental profitability that we should associate randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer right in our k we released around i wanna say the maintenance and capex environmental sustaining capex in the company now with the size that we are is around 200 and there s about 100 million of growth or efficiency type of capex going in there as always we won t breakdown by project for competitive reasons but we will tell you that all those projects return in the 15 to 20 return from our perspective we expect to see anywhere from 15 million layered on incremental ebitda coming forward kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst and you re a ceo who tends to really focus on returns and it s also about shareholder value my question and this is kind of out the sky would you ever think about separating the companies given the different divergence of profitability ddg on a different path maybe than the other and is there a value somewhere in that and i know that s a random question but just a thought randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer no it s always a very very fair question clearly obviously in my comments we wanna make sure people understand the value of the supply chain and that s really integral to the heart of this and as we ve gone forward when the plant started at 137 million gallons we all had our expectation of how much of our internally produced fat went in there it ended up being a little bit less than we thought but now at 275 it s ending up being a little more as we value add what i m gonna call the lower value animal fat that we produce in our system that work well down there and given the ci scores remember each facility that we have has a ci score that supports diamond green diesel so it s critical to control not only the supply chain the origination the logistics and the ci side that s what makes diamond green s performance so valuable now all that said obviously in the original documents with valero that are out there there is notes that said that really we ve got a marriage here for a lot of years and so any type of discussion of breaking it off is probably premature for me to ever talk about but at the same time i m always open minded to ways of creating shareholder value and trust me i believe that the value of diamond green is starting to show and that our share price will start to recognize the value of it ken kenneth zaslow bank of montreal analyst i appreciate it thanks operator our next question comes from adam samuelson of goldman sachs please go ahead scott bernstein goldman sachs analyst yeah hi this is scott bernstein on for adam samuelson i just had a question on what you re seeing on the impact from asf in china on the different businesses if you fought any in the second half of 2018 and any expectations for 2019 randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer this is randy again i ll give you a two second view on asf in china really we continue to monitor it very closely there are very very diverse opinions on what the impact is in china today i think it s safe to say we have seen the there s ample frozen supplies of pork meat as they increase their slaughter in the near term in china and at the same time we got a shrinking hog herd over there right now as we know in our plasma our blood processing plants there s just less animals and less blood available right now there s a strong move toward alternative meats right now the borders continue to be somewhat challenging for moving hogs around and also for bringing in what i d say non chinese meat into the country so as i started the comment saying we don t know what we don t in china today my gut says it s a bigger issue that s gonna take a longer time to work through than most people understand today but yet the pricing of pork in china doesn t support that theory today there is a thesis out there that says as we know operating a food business in china if you damage consumer confidence in your product it is a long term rebuilding of that demand and so there is some move away from pork even though it was the preferred meat for many many years and the largest pork consumer in the world so at the end of the day it feels like they continue to try to tell us when i say they being the chinese government it s under control but every day you see three more cases we ve heard numbers that range from the heard down 100 thousand head to 100 million head and all i can tell you is is for the plasma side of the business the supply it s probably 15 to 20 lower right now than it was a year ago so time will tell i think more concerning is the spread of the disease as it is over in vietnam now it s a very difficult disease to maintain europe has dealt with it for many many years and has biosecurity measures to manage it quite effectively but at the end of the day china has a very very challenging problem ahead in their meat sector scott bernstein goldman sachs analyst got it thank you very helpful and my only other question would be on the food segment i know you guys talked about collagen casings and edible fats on the slides and i just wanted to hear if you guys have some more comments on rousselot and if you could talk about the generally for the food business in 2019 randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think i ll give you three comments rousselot you see rousselot clearly makes up the largest part of that segment today the gelatin and collagen industry or collagen s referred to it seems to add a lot of head capacity in big chunks and over the course of 2015 16 it added quite a bit of capacity along the way and it just had to grow into it and work through that capacity so we ve seen margins improve around the world we ve had supply disruptions around the world with the amount of pigskin available hide available beef bone the margins seem to have normalized in that business and then we ve also continued to grow one of our specialty product lines and that s our factory that s coming on in amparo brazil today and angouleme france later this year and then ghent belgium the following year and then a second plant in brazil later on next year too so at the end of the day we feel pretty bullish about where our food segment s going if you look at it on a performance basis it would be down just a little bit year over year part of that s fx related if you normalize that but the casings business has softened quite a bit out there that s the natural casings business and that s related to a lot of the chinese discussion we already had the number of hogs being processed into the marketplace and then also we have an edible fats business and fat prices are down about 20 while that s a spread business you do take a little bit of ebitda hit there as those prices go down so overall rousselot s carrying its weight it feels pretty darn good going into 19 right now and i think we re very proud that the food segment will have an improved performance in 2019 scott bernstein goldman sachs analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from tom palmer of jpmorgan please go ahead thomas palmer jpmorgan analyst good morning thanks for the question randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer hey tom thomas palmer jpmorgan analyst you said at an industry conference that spot ebitda margins for renewable diesel were running around 1 40 a gallon stronger for the fourth quarter and i appreciate that diesel had declined a good amount over the course of the quarter but also wondered if there were any unique expense related items that contributed to ebitda this quarter so any hedging gains to call out was there an abnormally high mix of yellow grease because of the unexpected downtime in the prior quarter around that and then get a sense of what it s running at today randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer yeah no no great questions really are and obviously we wanted to articulate that so i appreciate the question obviously we have a pretty long supply chain to support the facility at 275 gallons and you do put on a lot of heating oil futures in that sense to hedge the supply chain and as we know today we don t get hedge accounting at that facility today so you get a mark to market so as we talked in the third quarter we had hedging losses then we have a return and had some hedging gains in q4 and that ll ebb and flow up and down as far as one supply versus another supply not really pretty constant obviously we try to originate to the right ci mass balance that we can do down there to meet our customers needs the plant has been running just excellent at capacity and above capacity and i guess the way we don t want to break it down any more than to say we anticipate margins for the full year of 2019 to be between 1 25 and 1 40 and you kinda nailed it down so there is some gains there in q4 for sure from the hedging side and occasionally you give those back but we ll reiterate our outlook for the full year thomas palmer jpmorgan analyst okay thanks for the color there also wanted to follow up on your expectations on the longer term outlook we have seen a few announcements regarding either construction or expansion of other renewable diesel facilities has your enthusiasm for the longer term profit potential changed at all and when you were considering the expansion for diamond green diesel had you assumed that there would be increased competition coming randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think i m gonna kinda refer everybody back to our investor day that we had last summer where we tried to lay out kind of the global low carbon fuel demand around the world that we see happening over the next three to five years i think we continue to believe that we understand that and that that s real once again we continue to you can monitor the carb website and see what kinda demand comes out of there at the end of the day i think it s as good a decision today as it was then if not better today we continue to feel very very optimistic about its role in fulfilling low carbon fuel demand both here and abroad and the performance of diamond green as we ve said coming into last year we thought we would average about a 1 25 a gallon without the blender s tax credit we ended up at 1 19 not a bad thing for an extended 45 days down in higher costs and we re giving you the same view today without the blender s tax credit as for the competition out there as john bullock reminds me it s pretty easy to put out an announcement on paper it takes a lot of money and time and effort to build a plant and we ve got what i consider to be a first mover s advantage it s pretty significant out there right now now all said i believe someone that if the margins are attractive and honey will attract flies here and eventually someone will commit the capital and the resources to do it but of the four or five projects have been announce out there i m not sure we know that any of those are what we would call real at this time they may be but not at least from our eyesight thomas palmer jpmorgan analyst all right thank you operator our next question comes from craig irwin of roth capital partners please go ahead craig irwin roth capital partners analyst hi good morning and thanks for taking my question so randy this quarter your production at diamond green showed a really nice jump as expected right p more than 50 above peak production looking backwards historically you ve talked about the importance of a thesis of buying more of your fats and the experience that you believe that there s a few pennies in fats prices that you ve seen as a benefit sort of the uplift of consuming your own product 0 03 to 0 05 with this 50 plus jump in production for diamond green in the quarter do you expect that uplift to maybe increase is there anything that you would point to us as external observers of the market that would maybe help us have a way to quantify this increase john bullock executive vice president and chief strategy officer this is john i think the way to look at that is obviously the increased demand that comes from diamond green diesel is going to ultimately have an impact on the price of the low ci fats and it ll have more of an impact as we get bigger and bigger and bigger in that segment it s hard for me to tell you that that s gonna happen in any 30 or 60 period of time but the trend is pretty obvious here and i think to answer your question the answer is pretty obvious of course it is and when it does it will impact in a positive way our core businesses randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer yeah and craig this is randy and i ll just augment what john says at the end of the day we ve only been running diamond green at the new rate now for 100 120 days and we basically had fat parked everywhere in the country because the extended downtime so at the end of the day we re starting to see from a low ci perspective there s a 0 03 to 0 04 a pound differential between the different feedstocks that we can support down there right now or that we process so it is going to have an impact on our core business and that s when we get really excited about super diamond and not only do we believe the margins can be sustained because of the global s d in demand also when you think about the waste cooking oil the animal fat and the distiller s corn oil business today from the ethanol administered we ve always said that number s around 13 14 billion pounds annually in this country and diamond green gonna take between 6 and 7 billion of that so it s kinda as john said in a sense it s kinda obvious we re gonna have a pretty good impact as we start to roll forward to the bigger plant here a few years out craig irwin roth capital partners analyst great thank you for that my second question s for brad so working capital in 2018 was the sixth year where this is a positive contribution for cash flow how do you see the potential for continuing to squeeze the balance sheet for cash in 19 is there anything you would call and then should we see a similar cadence to working capital to last year where you may be consumed a little bit in the first quarter and then got it back plus some by the end of the year brad phillips executive vice president and chief financial officer craig yeah you kinda nailed it there we re gonna be targeting and working toward similar to what we achieved this past year you re right we ve got a good five year tail here of improvement there and there was a lot to improve on and there are still some areas but we ll still see a bit and you re right i think you can expect it s probably a little bit more back half of the year where those stronger improvements come in randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer right and craig this is randy i ll build on that with brad because i think while this year we showed a little bit of improvement at the end of the day our volumes keep growing around the world so our capacity is growing pretty rapidly our opportunities still exist in our food segment to take some pretty significant working capital out of there and that comes to identifying the customer demands and the products we should be making there and i ll tell you what i think we re getting better each year in that area we ve been able to bring our inventories down pretty significantly in the rousselot area and we ll continue to do more and more of that as we go forward so i m even a little more optimistic than brad is coming into 19 here but it s also being offset by the higher volumes that we re processing around the world brad phillips executive vice president and chief financial officer great thank you for that and congratulations on the strong performance operator our next question comes from andrew goffe of overbrook management corporation please go ahead andrew goffe overbrook management analyst hi guys i was wondering how you re thinking about how the company will capitalize on the growing demand for renewable diesel in europe and kind of how you see how much demand could be coming from europe within the next couple of years randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer yeah and i ll take a shot then john can help me out here a little bit on this obviously we ve got a very very strong and we ve articulated our view and strategy on the usa and with our double downer 675 700 million gallon facility in the us and you think about it our usa production within the darling system s about a million tons of fat we have about half of that in europe today and so at the end of the day we re trying to figure out the correct way to value add that and that could take a whole bunch of various forms from building a facility in europe to shipping fat to the us to make diesel out of it to just only value adding a portion of our fat stream over there and at the end of the day we see that about half of the world s demand for low carbon fuels will be on the north american continent and probably about another half will around the world and so ultimately as we diamond green diesel to have the kind of the most efficient supply chain and logistical sight in the world we re kinda doing that same evaluation as we look forward and we ll be monitoring those markets to make sure that everybody has kinda the same commitment to reduction of greenhouse gases that seem to be articulated today john you got anything you wanna add to that john bullock executive vice president and chief strategy officer no i think you said it perfectly andrew goffe overbrook management analyst thanks operator our next question comes from bill baldwin of baldwin anthony securities please go ahead bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst good morning randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer morning bill brad phillips executive vice president and chief financial officer hey bill bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst just a housekeeping item here i was gonna ask is there anything in the revenue side of diamond green diesel on the rend hat was unusual or affected the revenues in the fourth quarter or was rend accounting pretty straight forward john bullock executive vice president and chief strategy officer this is john no there was nothing unusual bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst nothing unusual no ok i didn t know you banked any or randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer no there was no stockpiling of rend john bullock executive vice president and chief strategy officer no bill baldwin baldwin anthony securities analyst no stockpiling of rend no ok thank you very much john bullock executive vice president and chief strategy officer thanks operator our next question is a follow up from heather jones of vertical group please go ahead heather jones vertical group analyst yes thanks for taking this follow up first i just wanted to go back to europe so i know that a number of the countries there won t bring in renewable diesel from the us but you have a situation there where their double counting rules that s accelerating demand is accelerating and yet there s an issue of finding suitable feedstocks given the move away from palm etc so wondering if either a do you think there will be a big increase in imports of fats from the us into europe to feed these big plants that are coming online or will we see maybe a loosing of their standards the regulations as far as importing renewable diesel from the us john bullock executive vice president and chief strategy officer heather this is john they can import biofuel into the eu there s just a tariff associated with it that increases the cost of that your question on generally i think what we see in this there are several markets around the world where there re very good green premiums that are being paid for renewable fuel and one way or another the renewable diesel is gonna find its way to the markets what we re focused on is trying to make sure to develop the most efficient supply chains to service those markets and in the process utilize the fat that we produce out of our core business to maximize its value and we continue to look at that constantly obviously there are parts of europe that are gonna be extremely attractive markets for renewable diesel i think the general movement in europe is away from palm oil that doesn t mean that they will totally eliminate the use of palm oil but that speaks very favorably for the low ci feedstocks that we produce the used cooking oils and the animal fats and it s just a question of matching up the supply to the places that pay the really good green premiums heather jones vertical group analyst okay thank you my final question is could you speak to what do you see as the implications if there s a favorable resolution of us china trade dispute if we get a deal what are the implications for darlings business randall stuewe chairman and chief executive officer what we see when i refer to trade disruptions in the feed segment it s more industry related right now we were shipping a lot of poultry meals out of the processors in the us to china and to a degree those had backed up the potential tariffs that were on there so at the end of the day i think it helps strengthen our poultry processing side of our business i think china obviously has an animal herd their gonna have to rebuild and that ll take some time and so at the end of the day to me i think it should strengthen the overall green and soybean complex going forward here and at the end of the day that kind of spills over in various ways and helps us out heather jones vertical group analyst okay perfect thank you so much operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like

while an early end to a u s north korean summit in vietnam and weak economic data out of china also hit sentiment the japanese yen and the swiss franc both safe haven currencies gained after the united states and north korea failed to reach an agreement on denuclearisation of the korean peninsula after two days of meetings u s president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un had

hit on a lack of progress on trade issues between china and the u s and data showing factory activity contracting to a three year low in china the shanghai composite index fell 0 7 percent the data also showed export orders fell at their fastest pace since the global financial crisis adding to worries about the nearly year long trade dispute between china and the u s u s issues with china are too serious to be resolved with promises from beijing to purchase more u s goods and any deal between the two countries must include a way to ensure commitments are met u s trade representative robert lighthizer told u s lawmakers on wednesday advertisement advertisement lighthizer said the office of the united states trade representative ustr was taking legal steps to implement trump s decision on sunday to delay a tariff increase on more than 200 billion worth of chinese goods that had been scheduled for friday but ustr later clarified in a statement that it was not abandoning the threat of increasing the tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent story continues this is likely to be the sort of trade deal that comes through enough of a deal or delays of further taxes to enable equities to stay supported while still allowing enough room for u s president trump to criticize china on the campaign trail next year said paul donovan chief global economist at ubs wealth management in many ways this indefinite delay in the consequences are reminiscent of the deal agreed between trump and one of the many eu presidents juncker last year pulling back global equities scaled a four month high earlier this week helped by upbeat expectations towards u s china trade talks before pulling back after lighthizer spoke advertisement advertisement one suspects trade headlines will continue to throw around sentiment for a while yet the issues are complex the trade offs real and opinions divided anz strategists said in a note msci s all country world index was 0 2 percent lower on the day

based on us generally accepted accounting principles gaap non gaap financial information is provided to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial performance but none of these non gaap financial measures are recognized terms under gaap and non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap reconciliations of the most directly comparable gaap measures to non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews include adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share additionally we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates for example our ability to meet capital expenditures and working capital requirements and otherwise meet our obligations as they become due investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary information forward looking non gaap financial information is based on numerous assumptions including assumptions with respect to general business economic market regulatory and financial conditions and various other factors all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to cision many of which present non gaap measures when reporting their results these measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of gaap financial disclosures however non gaap measures have limitations as an analytical tool non gaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies they are not presentations made in accordance with gaap are not measures of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period determined in accordance with gaap or operating cash flows determined in accordance

revenue reduction from purchase accounting gains losses related to divested businesses or assets sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted ebitda are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding depreciation and amortization from ebitda users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their

income taxes adjusted net income loss before income taxes is then taxed at an assumed long term corporate tax rate of 33 for 2017 and periods prior and 26 for 2018 and beyond pursuant to our preliminary analysis with respect to recent u s tax law changes to determine adjusted net income the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017 resulted in a provisional net one time tax of 11 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects primarily from a tax on accumulated foreign earnings the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and new limitations on the deductibility of interest our calculation of adjusted net income excludes this provisional net one time tax we continue to finalize the analysis of the tax reform provisions in 2018 all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted net income are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding the amortization related to acquired intangibles users can compare operating performance without regard to highly variable amortization expenses related to our acquisitions in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 4 cision defines adjusted net income per diluted share as

announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended december 31 2018 with full year sales of 866 2 million and earnings per diluted share of 1 85 adjusted eps was 1 99 for 2018 considering adjustments related to changes in the fair value of the earn outs related to the pst and orlaco transactions certain business realignment costs and adjustments related to the impact of us tax reform jon degaynor president and chief executive officer commented in 2018 we continued our transformation of the company while delivering consistent financial performance throughout the year we outpaced our underlying markets growing revenue by 5 despite macroeconomic challenges in brazil and china as well as the continued and anticipated ramp down of our legacy shift by wire programs we expanded our ebitda margin which drove ebitda improvement of 8 year over year translating to adjusted earnings per share growth of 27 compare with 2017 we have positioned stoneridge to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth and we reiterate our expectations to eclipse both 1 billion in revenue and a 15 5 ebitda margin in 2021 for the full year 2018 stoneridge reported gross profit of 256 6 million 29 6 of sales and adjusted gross profit of 257 5 million 29 7 of sales operating income was 67 0 million 7 7 of sales and adjusted operating income was 71 2 million 8 2 of sales adjusted ebitda was 103 3 million 11 9 of sales full year in review control devices segment sales decreased by 0 6 primarily as a result of decreased sales volume in the north american automotive market as a result of certain program volume reductions partially offset by increased sales volume in china and our commercial vehicle markets control devices gross margin decreased slightly due to lower sales and higher direct material costs as a percentage of sales and the adverse impact of additional tariffs of approximately 2 4 million which were partially offset by lower overhead costs from a reduction in warranty costs the segment s adjusted operating income decreased by 8 6 electronics segment sales increased by 18 6 primarily due to an increase in european and north american commercial vehicle and off highway product sales electronics gross margin increased due to higher sales and favorable product mix partially offset by the adverse effect of u s denominated material purchases at non u s based operations the segment s adjusted operating income increased primarily due to the higher sales and lower sg a expenses resulting in adjusted operating margin for the segment of 9 0 compared with 7 4 in 2017 pst segment sales decreased by 15 7 primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation of 11 9 million or 12 6 as well as lower volumes for audio products and the argentina aftermarket channel pst gross margin improved slightly due to a favorable sales mix related to the lower volume of audio products that resulted in lower direct material costs as a percentage of sales pst adjusted operating margin increased from 5 5 in 2017 to 6 7 in 2018 primarily due to lower sg a costs as a percentage of sales degaynor added each of our segments contributed to our overall success in 2018 driving sales growth and margin expansion control devices continued to deliver growth throughout our product portfolio excluding the continued ramp down of our legacy shift by wire products electronics increased revenue by 18 6 with adjusted operating margin expansion of 160 basis points finally despite challenging macroeconomic conditions pst ended the year with a 120 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin cash and debt balances as of december 31 2018 stoneridge had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling 81 1 million total debt as of december 31 2018 was 98 5 million total debt less cash and cash equivalents yields a current net debt to trailing twelve month adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 0 2x 2019 outlook the company announced 2019 sales guidance of 855 875 million compared with 2018 sales of 866 2 million bob krakowiak chief financial officer commented we expect revenue to remain relatively flat as compared to 2018 with midpoint revenue guidance of 865 million as we have discussed previously 2019 will materially conclude the ramp down of our legacy shift by wire programs creating a revenue headwind of approximately 35 million relative to last year the ramp down of shift by wire in the second half of the year should be offset by new product launches including the rollout of our mirroreye retrofit program with respect to adjusted earnings per share we expect incremental net tariff expenses of 1 2 million in the first half of the year and incremental design and development investment of approximately 5 million in 2019 we expect that favorable product mix structural cost initiatives and operational improvements will approximately offset these additional costs in 2019 leading to flat operating income further the company announced guidance for 2019 adjusted gross margin of 29 5 31 0 midpoint improvement of 55 basis points adjusted operating margin of 7 75 8 75 and adjusted ebitda margin of 11 75 12 75 midpoint improvement of 35 basis points the company announced adjusted earnings per share guidance of 1 70 1 90 and an effective tax rate of 20 0 25 0 krakowiak continued we expect an increased tax rate relative to 2018 we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2019 to be in line with our previously provided guidance of 20 to 25 we expect a 0 15 to 0 20 reduction to adjusted eps relative to 2018 primarily driven by the increased tax rate expected in 2019 resulting in midpoint adjusted eps guidance of 1 80 conference call on the web a live internet broadcast of stoneridge s conference call

transitioned to a new wind blade model during the period 2018 was a challenging but successful year for tpi as we delivered strong operational and financial performance despite a significant number of startups and transitions said steven lockard tpi composites president and chief executive officer we achieved a number of strategic milestones over the past year and have continued that momentum thus far in 2019 in early 2018 we continued our global growth with vestas announcing a new manufacturing facility in yangzhou china and then early this year we announced another new manufacturing hub near chennai india that will initially serve vestas as well we also added enercon as a customer in may of last year further diversifying our customer base and got back on the growth path with ge by announcing two new lines and the extension of our agreement with them in mexico in addition to our growth into new geographies and diversifying our customer base we continue to strengthen our relationships with our existing customers during 2018 with the new agreements and amendments we increased our lines under long term supply agreements to 54 and increased our potential revenue under contract by a net of 2 4 billion we are now at a record 6 8 billion in potential contract value from a business development standpoint during 2018 we signed multiyear supply agreements for 16 new manufacturing lines including the four lines for vestas in india which went under contract in late december representing total contract revenue of up to 3 4 billion including amendments and our prioritized pipeline of lines that we plan to convert by the end of 2020 now stands at 19 lines as it relates to non wind business development in early 2018 we announced that we entered into an agreement with navistar to design and develop a class 8 truck comprised of composite tractor and frame rails an important step in continuing our diversification efforts and exploring our opportunities in the transportation space our customers continue to invest with tpi through the addition of new outsourced blade capacity as well as transitions to longer blades both of which have impacted our near term profitability but we believe position us very well for long term growth we believe the investments we made in 2018 and the additional investments that we expect to make in 2019 position us well for our goal of doubling our wind related sales by 2021 however revenue growth of over 50 doesn t come without challenges including the execution of multiple startups and transitions labor unrest in matamoros mexico that is currently creating production challenges as well as concerns about senvion given their recent announcement of their undertaking of a transformation program to stabilize the company s operations and strengthen its financial basis we remain focused on growing our wind business improving our operational effectiveness driving improved profitability and continuing to drive down the levelized cost of energy while continuing to develop and explore opportunities in other strategic markets we are pleased to see the continued growth of wind energy as a cost effective and reliable source of clean electricity as we and the industry continue to drive down lcoe and as consumers and corporate customers demand it we see the future of global electricity growth as cost effective and reliable wind solar storage and transmission concluded mr lockard fourth quarter 2018 financial results net sales for the quarter increased by 36 6 million or 14 4 to 290 1 million compared to 253 5 million in the same period in 2017 total billings increased by 62 1 million or 25 6 to 304 8 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to 242 7 million in the same period in 2017 net sales of wind blades were 257 8 million for the quarter as compared to 231 0 million in the same period in 2017 the increase was primarily driven by a 3 increase in the number of wind blades produced and higher average sales prices due to the mix of wind blade models produced year over year these increases were partially offset by adjustments recorded in 2018 under asc 606 based upon changes in estimates of future revenue cost of sales and operating income as well as by foreign currency fluctuations the impact of the fluctuating u s dollar against the euro at our turkey operations and the chinese renminbi at our china operations on consolidated net sales and total billings for the three months ended december 31 2018 was a net decrease of 1 4 and 1 3 respectively as compared to the same period in 2017 total cost of goods sold for the quarter was 277 5 million and included 20 5 million related to startup costs in our new plants in turkey mexico iowa and china the startup costs related to a new customer in taicang china and transition costs of 0 7 million related to the four lines in transition during the quarter this compares to total cost of goods sold of 223 2 million for the same period in 2017 which included 11 6 million related to startup costs in our new plants in turkey and mexico and no transition costs cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased by nearly eight percentage points during the three months ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 largely driven by the increase in startup and transition costs partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of savings in raw material costs the impact of the fluctuating u s dollar against the euro turkish lira chinese renminbi and mexican peso decreased consolidated cost of goods sold by 4 6 for the quarter as compared to the same period in 2017 our corporate overhead costs included within general and administrative expenses for the three months ended december 31 2018 totaled 11 6 million down slightly from 12 0 million for the same period in 2017 as a percentage of net sales corporate overhead costs were 4 0 for the three months ended december 31 2018 down from 4 7 in the same period in 2017 the 4 6 million of remaining general and administrative expenses during the three months ended december 31 2018 primarily related to discounts on the sale of certain receivables on a non recourse basis to financial institutions pursuant to supply chain financing agreements provided by certain of our customers the net loss for the quarter was 8 8 million as compared to net income of 2 2 million in the same period in 2017 the decrease was primarily due to higher startup and transition costs and the asc 606 adjustments discussed above diluted loss per share was 0 26 compared to diluted earnings per share of 0 06 for the 2017 period ebitda for the quarter decreased to 3 8 million compared to 24 2 million during the same period in 2017 ebitda margin decreased to 1 3 compared to 9 5 in the same period in 2017 adjusted ebitda for the quarter decreased to 9 8 million compared to 28 4 million during the same period in 2017 adjusted ebitda margin decreased to 3 4 compared to 11 2 during the same period in 2017 the decline was driven primarily by the increase in startup and transition activity and the resultant lost contribution margin from blade volume lost during the transitions capital expenditures were 2 1 million for the quarter compared to 9 5 million during the same period in 2017 our capital expenditures have been primarily related to machinery and equipment for new facilities or facility expansions we ended the quarter with 85 3 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt was 53 2 million as compared to net cash of 24 6 million at december 31 2017 and we had negative free cash flow during the quarter of 22 5 million 2019 guidance we have included the 2019 guidance we provided during our third quarter earnings call we do want to offer some caution about two matters which may put pressure on these guidance ranges first is the labor unrest at our manufacturing facility in matamoros mexico while we are actively working to resolve this situation any prolonged downtime from this situation will adversely affect our adjusted ebitda and net sales for 2019 in addition the ultimate outcome of the labor negotiations may require us to increase our labor rates in matamoros beyond what we have forecasted which could further reduce our adjusted ebitda secondly the financial difficulties our customer senvion announced that they are experiencing could also ultimately impact our 2019 net sales and adjusted ebitda at this point it is still too early to tell if these two situations offset by other upside opportunities we have will have a material impact or not on our 2019 adjusted ebitda and net sales guidance with that being said we expect net sales and total billings of between 1 5 billion and 1 6 billion and adjusted ebitda of between 120 million and 130 million and fully diluted earnings per share of between 1 34 and 1 45 and sets invoiced of between 3 300 and 3 500 average sales price per blade of between 135 000 and 140 000 and estimated megawatts of sets delivered of approximately 9 800 to 10 400 dedicated manufacturing lines at year end to be

year to be approximately 10 line utilization based on 50 lines under contract of approximately 85 startup costs of between 30 million and 33 million and transition costs of between 22 million and 25

he has written on the monetary policy implications of the low inflation period created by the 2008 financial crisis he also introduced in 2014 the concept of a new neutral for fed monetary policy which predicted a substantial decline in r the interest rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation whereas before the crisis r was thought to be above 4 percent clarida wrote in 2014 that r was now closer to 2 percent than to 4 percent speaking at a monetary policy conference sponsored by the university of chicago booth school of business clarida contrasted what amounts to the current strategy treating persistent shortfalls of inflation from the 2 target as bygones to makeup strategies where the fed could target average inflation over a multiyear period or target price levels another question clarida says the fed is seeking to answer is whether to expand its tool kit for instance he said the fed could take a page from the bank of japan s playbook and establish a temporary ceiling for treasury yields at longer maturities by standing ready to purchase them david stockman was director of the office of management and budget under president ronald reagan after leaving the white house stockman had a 20 year career on wall street by david stockmanas we indicated in part 1 central banking essentially ceased to be about money and monetary policy in october 1987 when greenspan panicked on black monday and pulled out the monetary and institutional stops to rescue wall street thereafter it was ostensibly about economy but not really economy was the pretext for coddling propping and pleasuring wall street pursuant to a de novo theory of wealth effects management which in turn was supposed to soup up the gdp needless to say the quantitative model clutching phds and do gooder apparatchiks who thereafter populated the eccles building were playing with fire as they drifted further and further away from traditional tenets about money and backstopping the commercial banking system it was possible to concoct virtually any cockamamie theory of economy that could justify plenary intrusion into the price setting process of the money and capital markets of wall street moreover the content free indefinitely rubbery statutory remit known as humphrey hawkins gave high minded sounding cover to the utter nonsense which ensued for instance there is no way to know what maximum employment is in an open global economy functioning during an internet based day and age when what was historically known as a job is no longer a meaningful or even plausible unit of account scheduling hundreds of thousands of cashiers by 15 minute intervals at walmart and its ilk or deploying 60 000 free lancers by the gig on task rabbit cannot possibly be captured by the bls primitive archaic metrics nevertheless in its january minutes the fed implied that currently its proximate maximum employment target is 4 3 on the bls u 3 unemployment measure but that s patently ridiculous the us economy is not even remotely close to full employment because massive welfare state and regulatory policies militate against it for instance there are 40 50 billion annual hours sequestered in studentdom and supported outside of the bls measured labor force by upwards of 2 trillion of student grants and loans since 2007 alone but changes in policy and circumstances can cause billions of these hours to ebb and flow in and out of the bls measured labor force for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the fed s policy rate target or any of its other heavy handed intrusions in the money and capital markets likewise at the turn of the century when the u 3 rate was last at under 4 0 there were about 10 billion labor hours sequestered in social security disability but that number has since soared to more than 20 billion hours owing to a major relaxation of administrative procedures and case law standards for eligibility crucially however there is nothing firm and fixed over time about the disability sequester of labor hours billions of these hours can drift in an out of the money economy and the black market off the books economy for reasons that have nothing to do with the machinations of the fomc indeed the 12 members of the fomc might as well be standing out on independence avenue waving their arms in order to keep marauding elephants from over running the eccles building that s about how useful u 3 is as a measure of labor market or macroeconomic conditions and it s a reminder that maximum employment is just an economy cover story for what the fed really does manipulate financial asset prices and kow tow to the wall street gamblers whenever they have a hissy fit in the real world by contrast it is self evident that the potential labor supply from both domestic and off shore sources is virtually limitless accordingly the only thing needed to mobilize more employed hours is the labor pricing system not the monetary politburo s fomc machinations in the financial markets at a high enough wage rate you will get housewives out of the kitchen students off their duffs more volunteers for over time and if need be more peasants out of the chinese or vietnamese rice paddies in today s globally networked traded and welfare enabled world there will never be a physical shortage of labor hours just the right price to bring latent hours into monetized production to be sure the latent hours now sequestered in federally subsidized basket weaving classes or playing shuffle board on early retirement or disability do raise market clearing wage levels at the margin but you can solve that problem but cutting welfare benefits not giving the fed an economy mandate that is nothing more than an excuse to randomly and destructively fiddle with interest rates and financial asset prices after all the point of over riding what used to be the free market on wall street in pre greenspanian times is to falsify them by the lights of 12 people who can t possibly know what they are doing and have no effective tools to manage the real economy anyway see below stated differently falsifying the price of money bonds and equities only fosters increasingly destructive gambling bubbles and malinvestments in the financial system not higher production employment and prosperity on main street the truth of the matter of course is that there is no need for central bankers at all when it comes to economic growth jobs incomes and prosperity that s because say s law is as valid today as it has always been work effort production and enterprise are what create both current income and future growth demand flows from supply and spending flows from income capitalism doesn t need any u 3 obsessed central bankers to make it all happen likewise the labor pricing system in a 20 trillion economy has it hands down over the 12 phds bankers and washington apparatchiks who sit on the fomc if the market is heavy with latent labor hours real wage rates will come down and if it s light real wage rates will rise sufficiently to attract the needed hours in fact now that most of the monopoly industrial unions have been broken or defanged even the old keynesian saw about sticky wages is self evidently inoperative the truth is there is nothing about the contemporary labor market that requires the helping hand of the federal reserve at all moreover there is no even theoretical possibility of runaway wage inflation of the type that industrial unions led by the uaw and steelworkers were able to generate in the late 1960s that because virtually every manner of goods produced in the us economy and a growing portion of services can now be supplied from off shore and often at far lower wage rates even adjusted for productivity and transportation than paid by domestic suppliers accordingly we think there is a far more insightful and accurate way to look at labor utilization and to assess whether or not the fed s heavy handed intrusions in the money and capital markets have accomplished anything at all spoiler alert the 4 0 trillion of asset purchases by the fed between the year 2000 when its balance sheet was about 500 billion and the recent peak when it hit 4 5 trillion accomplished exactly nothing on the maximum employment node of the economy front that is to say back in the year 2000 the last time u 3 hit 3 7 what we consider to be the comprehensive unemployment rate was 34 6 today it stands at 40 0 to be sure many factors drive whether potential labor hours get sequestered outside of the monetized economy in housework studentdom on the welfare rolls in the black market drug trade or in mom s basement but the interest rate on overnight fed funds is surely the least of them nor self evidently was the fed s massive fraudulent monetization of 4 trillion of us treasury and related debt in the interim thus in december 2000 there were 175 5 million adults aged 20 69 in the us meaning that the implied potential labor force amounted to 351 billion labor hour per annum assuming all adults are theoretically capable of a standard work year of 2000 hours during that same month however the bls measured just 229 5 billion hours actually employed in the non farm economy at an annual rate accordingly comprehensive unemployment amounted to 121 5 billion hours or 34 6 of the potential available hours by contrast the adult population 20 69 years of age is now 212 3 million and available hours total 424 6 billion per annum against that the bls most recent measure shows 255 6 billion hours actually employed implying 169 billion unemployed labor hours and a 40 0 comprehensive unemployment rate stated differently between the two 3 7 4 0 anchor points on the u 3 unemployment metric during the last 18 years the level of unemployed us labor has increased by nearly 48 billion hours per annum and the rate has risen commensurately we dwell on the fed s ludicrous pretension that it can and has achieved full employment because today we had another fed head gumming about the second economy target inflation that is even more far fetched in fact this blithering fool even suggested that to insure american workers savers and retirees are punished with sufficient inflation the fed should consider adopting japan s insane policy of pegging its 10 year bond rate with an open ended promise to buy any all offers at that target yield we are referring here to relatively new fed head richard clarida and for those under the mistaken impression that barrack obama was the sole source of america s economic mess and that donald trump can maga it should be remembered that this whack job was appointed by the donald not barry worse still he is the former chairman of the columbia university economics department high ranking treasury official in the george w bush administration and global strategic advisor to the world s largest bond fund pimco that is to say the keynesian group think has become nearly universal not surprisingly clarida s academic specialty centered on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling dsge which is the true incarnation of voodoo economics in the present world also not surprisingly he apparently passed muster with the low interest man in the oval office because his research made exactly that case as summarized in his wikipedia page you could call that discovery prescient even if it does amount to statistical and analytical hogwash during the 11 years before the pre crisis peak in q4 2007 for example the fed s favorite sawed off inflation measure the pce deflator rose at a 2 04 annualized rate by contrast during the 11 years since then the cagr posted at 1 54 per annum meaning that there has been a mere 50 bps basis points downshift from the pre crisis to the post crisis trend not a radical change in the inflation regime as implied in clarida s purported discovery about an invisible ether called r it s actually just noise and rounding errors especially given the arbitrary weightings and inherent imprecision of statistical baskets consisting of thousands of individual prices yet among another of the economy obsessed phds who have taken over the central bank the above essentially meaningless difference is enough to support a 50 reduction in the fed s so called neutral interest rate bogey and the pure absurdity which flows therefrom to wit clarida like central bankers everywhere today treats the 2 00 inflation target as virtually sacred scripture although there is no empirical or logical basis for it at all indeed the idea that low inflation or deflation will cause consumers to withhold spending was massively disproved by the plunging prices of the computer age long ago nevertheless clarida also contends as per the above that the neutral money rate is also 2 00 which means apparently that the money market should be cost free in real terms forever and that savers who want to stay liquid deserve to rot in zero return purgatory for just as long nor do we exaggerate when it comes to the idiotic idea of too little inflation here is what the man said today and also what the fed should do about it as to the inflation shortfall and price level targeting point here is the pce deflator indexed to 100 in the year 2000 the chart shows that at its current reading of 138 3 that the compound rise in the pce deflator has clocked in at 1 82 since 2000 and that to achieve clarida s full monte 2 00 under the price level targeting solution it would currently need to post at 142 3 so there you have it can anyone in their right mind believe that the us economy would have behaved any differently over the last 18 years or be any more prosperous today if the pce deflator stood at 142 3 last fall rather than the 138 3 actually recorded the truth is this is puzzle palace obscurantism unfortunately it rules the day among central bankers and is the basis for their next big assault on honest price discovery on wall street and sustainable prosperity on main street we are referring to price level targeting and bond rate pegging as if the massive interest rate repression that we have already experienced has not done enough damage stated differently the federal government is lurching into a massive crisis of national solvency and the corporate and household sectors have already buried themselves under 15 trillion of debt each owing to the fed s false price signal that rising debt scan be rolled over perpetually at lower and lower rates now this clown actually wants to emulate the sheer insanity of the boj which has pushed nearly all of the government of japan s monumental debt into negative nominal yields still for the want of doubt part 3 will detail exactly how this greenspan bernanke yellen powell clarida style of ostensibly economy based central banking is fueling massive speculation on wall street and why the resulting doom loop will eventually take down what remains of main street prosperity

image desiree caplas adobe stock aud cedes further ground on weak chinese data china manufacturing sector contracted in february data takes shine off aud capex number q4 gdp report ahead the pound to australian dollar exchange rate was seen hovering near a four month high at 1 8688 at the turn of the new month on the back of a combination of falling brexit risks in the uk and aussie negative newsflow out of asia the australian dollar complex weakened on thursday in response to signs of a further contraction in the chinese manufacturing sector during february which has helped the pound to aussie rate to a fresh four month high due to fears that china s economic problems will also impact upon the domestic economy china federation of logistics and purchasing pmi data pointed toward a further contraction of manufacturing output this month with the index falling from 49 5 to 49 2 when markets had anticipated an unchanged reading that number is consistent with an ongoing recession in the sector this is a problem for the australian dollar because the currency is substantially underwritten by a large bilateral commodity trade with chin which has given the aussie a strong positive correlation with the renmimbi presumably most of the minerals and resources sold to china are used by the manufacturing sector we think that chinese stimulus is ramping up to gradually offset the downside momentum but for now we still expect some further disappointments in chinese data in coming months says ebrahim rahbari head of fx strategy at citi the pound to australian dollar exchange rate is quoted at 1 8688 in the wake of the numbers having been as high as 1 8695 in the previous 12 hours a level that represents a near four month high pmi surveys measure changes in industry activity by asking respondents to rate conditions for employment production new orders prices deliveries and inventories a number above the 50 0 level indicates industry expansion while a number below is consistent with contraction the chinese figures dented the aussie but came hard on the heels of final quarter business capital expenditure data which showed australian companies increasing their investment spending sharply during the period while also revealing plans for a big pick up in investment next year above pound to australian dollar rate shown at daily intervals capital expenditure rose by 2 in the final quarter of 2018 when markets had looked for only a 0 8 increase which has provided an offset to the dire construction output data released wednesday this is good news because of what it might mean for reserve bank of australia rba interest rate policy in the second half of 2018 at least some of the weakness in gdp is coming from soft investment spending yet at the same time state governments are ramping up infrastructure spending and the private capex survey is telling us that firms investment plans are increasing this inconsistency suggests supply side factors may be contributing to the softness in gdp says david plank an economist at australia new zealand banking group anz the rba said this month that president donald trump s trade war was threatening to see business investment decisions delayed and that investment is likely to be a key pillar of aussie economic growth over the coming years it forecast that a pick up in business investment will support stronger demand within the economy and faster wage growth which are what it hopes will enable the rba inflation target to be met without first having to cut its interest rate however the bank also said that it would cut its interest rate if the economy slows further and the labour market produces a sustained increase in the unemployment rate before noting that the risks of a rate cut being delivered over the coming quarters are finely balanced with the odds of a hike coming our labour market indicator points to a period of stability for the unemployment rate rather than a sharp jump higher if this is right we think the rba will look through weak gdp prints though it will be an uncomfortable time says plank the rba has held its interest rate at a record low of 1 5 for more than two years now citing below target inflation as well as an economic outlook that means wage pressures are unlikely to be sufficient enough to lift the consumer price index to within the 2 to 3 target band thursday s capex data is important not only because of the rba narrative but also because it is among the final pieces in the fourth quarter gdp growth puzzle gdp data will be released on wednesday 06 march and the rba is looking for growth of 0 5 but economists are sceptical of that forecast gdp growth was just 0 3 on a quarterly basis during the three months to the end of september and if anything data covering the final quarter has pointed to the economy losing even further momentum into year end above aud usd rate shown at daily intervals given the weak state of the chinese economy and doubts over the durability of the trade war truce between china and the u s a poor gdp number could see the australian dollar succumb to a cocktail of negative sentiment next week president trump said tariffs on some chinese exports to the u s will no longer rise to 25 on march 01 as had been planned because negotiators are making progress in talks to end china s unfair trade practices but analysts are sceptical of the idea that a deal will actually be reached and that it would last even if one were to be struck i am cutting my long aud view it seems like we are caught in the domestic bad global good stalemate still says brent donnelly a spot currency trader at hsbc in new york the market is treating the us china thing as a done deal it is not a done deal that could have positive implications for the pound to australian dollar rate which has been lifted to a four month high this week by a mixture of antipodean weakness and market hopes that the uk s departure from the eu will eventually be delayed if not abandoned altogether by mps in parliament the pound to australian dollar rate was quoted 0 03 higher at 1 8632 thursday and is now up by 2 97 for the year to date while the aud usd rate was 0 12 lower at 0 7140 but has risen 1 25 in 2019

president and ceo and ben schlater group vice president and chief financial officer the earnings release and conference call presentation deck are available in the investors section of our website i d like to remind everyone that some of the comments we are making today are forward looking statements and are based on our view of conditions and circumstances as we see them today however these views may change as conditions and circumstances change please refer to the forward looking statements disclosure in the earnings release and the earnings presentation also today s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis descriptions of these non gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release and the presentation deck we encourage you to view that information in conjunction with today s discussion it is now my pleasure to pass the call over to peter peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer thanks kevin and good morning everyone ferro reported another strong year of growth in 2018 revenue increased 15 adjusted eps increased 16 and adjusted ebitda increased 5 ferro generated strong cash flow with free cash flow conversion of more than 51 in addition as of the end of 2018 we delivered our 10th consecutive quarter of organic growth to the ferro team around the world i extend my congratulation on these excellent results ferro s year over year improvement in financial performance demonstrates that we now have a portfolio of businesses substantially stronger than we had several years ago when we implemented our value creation strategy we have elevated the quality of our portfolio by divesting non core assets and making acquisitions that expand our leadership in higher growth higher margin niche markets now in the dynamic innovation and optimization phase of our strategy we are investing in these enhanced technology platforms within our portfolio to drive new product development and fuel organic growth at the same time we are advancing optimization initiatives to improve productivity and efficiency such as the america s manufacturing consolidation project we announced in june we are pleased with the innovation and optimization objectives achieved to date and excited about the opportunities ahead you can see the positive results produced so far and the favorable trajectory that has developed in the charts included on the first page of our earnings release we believe ferro is positioned for long term sustainable value creation for 2019 we expect to continue to generate growth in revenue and profitability that compares favorably with our industry our peers are reporting softening in some markets and we will not be immune to such conditions however ferro will continue to bring new products to market as we expand into new markets and we will continue to optimize our operations we remain confident that ferro will continue to grow revenue and profitability in 2019 even if at a somewhat slower pace than in 2018 with all the talk about uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions let s focus a minute on the optimization side of our strategy optimization initiatives are designed to enable ferro to lift profitability even when we encounter softness in market conditions we see significant optimization opportunities within our business today and we are moving forward with initiatives so that we can drive profitability even if broader market conditions soften the america s manufacturing optimization initiative that we announced last month is one such opportunity this initiative is expected to contribute 8 million to adjusted ebitda in 2019 and approximately 30 million by the end of 2020 now taking a global perspective on our optimization initiatives over the past two years we have consolidated six manufacturing sites and other facilities and by early 2020 we expect to consolidate an additional seven manufacturing sites including those affected by the america s manufacturing optimization initiative in other words we are working hard on optimization now so that even if market conditions weaken in the future we can still deliver market leading improvements in profitability now let me say a word about the fourth quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter along with the raw material cost headwinds that we encountered during much of the year we also experienced mix in customer order patterns that negatively impacted margins as we previously reported seasonal destocking and inventory repositioning were higher than usual particularly by customers of our higher end tile products previously these customers were carrying approximately six to eight months of finished goods but with the destocking in the fourth quarter this was reduced to about three to four months as a result we experienced a negative impact to margins due to the decline in high end volume and a relative increase in middle market volume and as we previously reported orders for performance colors and glass products were pushed into 2019 due to capacity utilization footprint optimization initiatives while we were disappointed with the circumstances at the end of 2018 we are pleased at the way our business model is delivering strong year over year growth in revenue and profitability we also were pleased with the cash flow generated by the business in 2018 which gives us flexibility to invest in acquisitions buy back shares and pay down debt as appropriate now i ll turn to the performance of our three business segments for the fourth quarter and full year in the presentation deck you can see some of these on slides six and seven our fourth quarter and full year performance for our three main business segments let s begin with performance coatings in the fourth quarter performance coatings volumes increased 7 7 while net sales on a constant currency basis increased 12 8 organic sales increased 3 8 adjusted gross profit declined slightly to 36 5 million gross profit margin declined to 20 3 from 23 1 reflecting the shift in mix in volume resulting from the destocking and inventory repositioning that i mentioned earlier for the full year 2018 performance coatings volumes increased 11 9 while net sales increased 24 5 to 733 9 million organic sales grew 3 7 adjusted gross profit increased year over year to 166 7 million gross profit margin for the year was 22 7 compared with 25 5 in the prior year during 2018 the performance coatings segment was affected by significantly elevated raw material prices now we expect the destocking that we experienced in the fourth quarter to carry into the first quarter of 2019 while we anticipate improvement for the remainder of 2019 as high end market inventories return to their usual size before moving to our next business segment i should point out that to counter the industry challenges we encountered during 2018 the performance coatings team did a great job implementing price increases reformulating products and optimizing brand spend now let s look at our performance colors and glass segment in the fourth quarter performance colors and glass volumes declined 2 1 with net sales on a constant currency basis down 2 7 organic sales declined 4 1 adjusted gross profit increased to 38 7 million gross profit margin declined to 32 9 from 34 5 for the full year performance colors and glass volumes increased 12 7 with net sales on a constant currency basis up 8 1 to 487 5 million organic sales grew 6 4 adjusted gross profit increased year over year to 167 5 million gross profit margin for the year was 34 4 down from 35 9 in the prior year for over a year pcg s growth in the auto market has been strong as demand for our product applications increased and we took market share in the fourth quarter of 2018 our pcg auto sales were down 2 7 as global auto builds declined approximately 6 mainly as a result of the slowdown in asia inaudible for the full year 2018 our pcg auto business grew 7 4 continuing our long track of market outperformance driven by asia which was up 14 and europe which was up 8 and offset by a decline in the us of about 7 demand was muted in the quarter for ferro s electronic materials with sales down 3 year over year for 2018 sales increased 10 4 looking ahead we are excited about the growth potential for this business our electronic materials go into sensors dielectric and capacitors which are used in fast growing areas like intelligent automation the number of sensors per product in a variety of markets for example has been rising as products are made more intelligent and this in turn drives demand for our high performance materials and sensors fourth quarter sales for our industrial product line declined by 10 3 mainly as a result of customers delaying the orders for our dip tech printers as they anticipated new printer technology that we unveiled late last year for the year industrial sales increased 11 2 ferro is a technology leader in functional glass coatings we are leveraging our technical knowledge and innovation capabilities to fuel future growth among the market following this mega trend including the intelligent automation 5g smart cars and led now turning to the color solutions segment summary in the fourth quarter color solutions delivered strong sales and profit growth net sales on a constant currency basis increased 19 4 while volumes were down 1 2 organic sales increased 14 7 adjusted gross profit increased to 33 4 million gross profit margin expanded to 34 1 from 31 1 for the full year 2018 color solutions net sales increased 7 8 to 391 million while volume was down 5 organic sales grew 5 6 adjusted gross profit increased to 129 million gross profit margin for the year increased to 33 up from 32 5 in the prior year fourth quarter sales growth for the color solutions business was due in large part to the continued strong demand for our surface technology product we are seeing robust demand in this business from memory chip makers who use our highly engineered inaudible in their manufacturing process we experienced a softening in the inaudible colors which are used in inaudible as customers worked on inventories due to slower housing construction demand for inaudible automotive applications also declined inaudible however demand for our specialty pigments in these military applications was strong now a brief comment on our balance sheet we are taking a very prudent orientation to our balance sheet maintaining the leverage margin ph we intend to deploy capital as we do most appropriate more acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayment so to sum it all up ferro delivered another very good year in 2018 we showed strong growth in revenue and profitability and generated significant cash flow and again i extend my thanks and congratulations to our associates around the world for another strong year with that i ll turn the call over to ben for his comments benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer thank you peter and good morning everyone i d like to start out this morning discussing our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 please note that the non gaap numbers i refer to are on an adjusted basis and growth rates mentioned are on a constant currency basis all comparisons are versus the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 the financial highlights and results can be reviewed on slides three four and five in the presentation accompanying today s call which you can find on ferro com in the investors section starting with the fourth quarter we grew net sales 9 1 to 395 5 million with organic sales growth of 3 6 adjusted gross profit increased 3 5 to 108 8 million adjusted sg a expense was 66 4 million or 16 8 of net sales we grew adjusted ebitda by 6 4 to 56 1 million or 14 2 of net sales and adjusted eps increased 13 8 to 0 33 now turning to slide five i ll go through our full year 2018 performance we grew net sales 14 9 to 1 6 billion adjusted gross profit increased 7 4 to 462 3 million adjusted gross profit margin was 28 7 adjusted sg a expense was 257 2 million or 16 of net sales we grew adjusted ebitda by 12 to 259 1 million or 16 1 of net sales and adjusted eps increased 16 3 to 1 50 with that i ll review one time adjustments for the fourth quarter and provide an overview of certain items within our financial statements for the fourth quarter there were a few non gaap adjustments primarily related to our corporate development acquisition and optimization activities as well as our annual mark to market adjustment for our pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities first in cost of sales we had adjustments of approximately 3 7 million for the fourth quarter primarily due to acquisitions and costs related to optimization initiatives in sg a we had one time adjustments of 4 6 million in the quarter consisting of legal professional and other expenses related to certain corporate development activities certain optimization initiatives including the manufacturing optimization we announced in january of this year turning to restructuring and impairment there was an adjustment of approximately 2 9 million in the fourth quarter related to actions to achieve our ongoing optimization initiative and acquisition synergies in the quarter under other income and expense we had an adjustment of about 17 6 million this was primarily related to pension and other post retirement mark to market adjustments of 18 3 million with an offset in earn out adjustments related to acquisitions that are beyond the measurement period finally we have adjusted out or removed a benefit in the fourth quarter of approximately 4 5 million as a result of clarification to the tax cuts and jobs act and the revaluation of certain tax assets in our americas region the fourth quarter adjusted sg a expense was 66 4 million or 16 8 of net sales compared with 67 8 million or 18 7 of net sales in the prior year quarter as stated on a constant currency basis newly acquired businesses accounted for the increase we continue to see good operating leverage as we grow the top line while maintaining relatively flat sg a at the base company level interest expense for the quarter was 8 7 million compared to 7 8 million in the prior year quarter and for the year interest expense was 33 million compared to 27 8 million in the prior year we ended the year with an adjusted tax rate of 22 7 compared to a 27 tax rate in 2017 the decline in the rate year over year was primarily driven by the utilization of fully valued tax credit and the release of certain valuation allowance we do not currently expect these impacts to repeat in 2019 this brings me to cash flow we are very pleased with the efforts our team has made to improve the efficiency of the balance sheet in 2019 for the fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations was an inflow of 146 1 million which compares to an inflow of 55 5 million for the prior year quarter for the year we improved our adjusted free cash flow by 105 5 to 189 1 million compared to 86 4 million in the prior year we define adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations as gaap net cash provided by operating activities less capex then we add back cash used for our most significant optimization projects acquisition related items and restructuring activity the most meaningful components for the full year 2018 are as follows starting with gaap net income of 80 9 million we add 57 6 million of depreciation and amortization 21 9 million in working capital 15 million of change in other balance sheet items 7 5 million of other non cash p l items to arrive at cash generated from operating activities of 182 8 million on a gaap basis then we subtract 80 6 million of capital expenditures and cash received on other receivables of 7 million to arrive at 109 2 million of free cash flow for the year our practice has been to adjust this number for cash flow related to our strategic activities these include one cash related to our optimization project two m a related cash flow and three cash to our restructuring programs the quantification of those three adjustments for the year are as follows 58 4 million for the optimization projects 12 3 million related to m a and 9 2 million related to restructuring when we add these items back to our gaap numbers this brings adjusted free cash flow for the year to 189 1 million or 73 cash conversion i ll also note that this figure reflects the benefit of approximately 57 million from the ar facility we closed in the fourth quarter without that benefit cash conversion would have been 50 9 consistent with our increased guidance next i d like to share the company s capital deployment activity in 2018 in the fourth quarter the company repurchased approximately 660 000 shares for approximately 11 8 million in the year the company deployed approximately 145 million in investments the company repurchased 1 5 million shares for 28 8 million we intend to continue repurchasing shares as circumstances and prices warrant in the year the company also invested approximately 75 million in acquisitions and 41 million related to the optimization project we announced last month and finally the company ended the year with leverage of 2 8 times consistent with our expectations of being less than 3 times so this concludes my prepared remarks on the fourth quarter and the full year for 2018 now i d like to spend some time reviewing our 2019 guidance we expect to deliver sales growth in the range of 3 to 4 or 5 5 to 6 5 on a constant currency basis adjusted gross profit margin within a range of 30 2 to 30 5 adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales of 16 6 to 16 8 other income and expense in a range of 5 5 million to 6 5 million interest expense to be in a range of 36 million to 39 million and we expect our tax rate to be between 26 5 to 27 5 these metrics translate to 2019 full year guidance of adjusted ebitda in a range of 280 million to 290 million which would be up nominally 8 to 12 or 10 to 15 on a constant currency basis over 2018 adjusted eps in a range of 1 55 to 1 65 an increase of 3 to 10 or 7 to 14 on a constant currency basis over 2018 and adjusted free cash flow conversion between 45 and 50 this cash flow should yield between 125 million and 140 million of adjusted free cash flow for 2019 from that range we will subtract additional spending on the optimization project we announced last month and non restructuring actions this cash generation we anticipate leverage being 2 2 times to 2 5 times at the end of 2019 before any acquisition related spending to be consistent with our previous practice 2019 guidance reflects foreign exchange spot rates as of 12 31 2018 at 1 147 for the euro we have provided fx sensitivity in the guidance section of the earnings release in 2018 ferro generated approximately 40 to 45 of revenue in euros and approximately 25 to 30 in us dollars we estimated that a 1 overall change in foreign currency exchange rate weighting for the countries where we do business would impact sales by approximately 10 million to 12 million and operating profit by 1 5 million to 1 7 million if you isolate the sensitivity on euro a 1 change would impact operating profit by approximately 1 1 million to 1 3 million at this point keeping with prior practices i would like to spend a few minutes bridging our adjusted ebitda and eps guidance starting with adjusted ebitda of 259 million from 2018 you add organic growth of 5 million to 7 million then you add 7 million to 9 million for our optimization programs then you add 8 million to 10 million for price versus raw material tailwind then we add another 18 million for the acquisitions we completed in 2014 and finally we subtract a headwind of 7 million due to fx the sum of those items to the 2018 adjusted ebitda of 259 million equals our guidance range of 280 million to 290 million now turning to our walk for eps starting at our adjusted eps for 2018 of 1 50 we add 0 03 to 0 05 from organic growth then we add 0 04 to 0 06 for our optimization program to that we add 0 05 to 0 07 from acquisitions we completed in 2018 then we add 0 05 to 0 07 for our price versus raw material tailwind and then we subtract 0 04 to 0 05 for the change in our tax rate from 2018 and subtract 0 03 to 0 04 for increased interest expense finally we subtract about 0 05 for fx headwind the sum of those pieces to the 2018 adjusted eps of 1 50 equals our guidance range of 1 55 to 1 65 for 2019 further i d like to give some context into how we view the quarters through 2019 we expect the second and third quarter to be our strongest earning quarters similar to the earnings distribution in 2018 on an adjusted basis given the expense of the destocking in performance coatings in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2019 we expect this to impact the first quarter s earnings we expect the first quarter adjusted eps to be in the range of 16 to 18 at the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance range of 1 55 to 1 65 in context we are very pleased with the performance of the business in 2018 and the sustainable revenue and earnings growth we are pleased with the way the business is positioned as a leading technology based functional coatings and color solutions company and we remain focused on keeping the business agile to adapt to changing market conditions with that i ll now turn the call over to kevin for q a kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate relations operator please open up the call for the first question questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question comes from rosemarie morbelli of g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good morning everyone peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer good morning rosemarie benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer good morning rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so just starting with something ben just said it looks as though if my math is correct that the first quarter eps is going to be around 0 28 which compares with 0 36 last year so what makes you comfortable looking at the full year what are the improvements you are looking at in the next three quarters because you have to generate quite a lot of growth in those last three quarters and i know ben gives us the details of the pluses and minuses but a little more of the underlying operations would be and markets would be helpful peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer hi rosemarie it s peter it all starts with the fact that we did notice continued destocking at our higher end markets not only within tile but a couple of the other businesses that continued through the first quarter and more importantly a lot of the tile products at the high end continue through the month of february and if you take a look at that destocking in total for the company in the first quarter it really makes up the difference from last year and you heard in my prepared remarks the magnitude of the destocking and it s actually a good news bad news story when you reposition yourself in the higher end markets because companies typically have more finished goods inventory because they typically carry more skus because of the diverse market applications and that was the first time that we ve seen something like that in fact you heard me mention that the high end tile producers which by the way is as close as we get to a consumer product that has fashion orientation to it that they typically would have six to eight months of finished goods versus the bottom cut or the mid cut which could be two to three months so when there is an inventory destocking that we ve seen for the first time since 2016 it usually goes through the fourth quarter into the first quarter so we feel very comfortable where we sit today that all the destocking has taken place across all of our high end markets throughout the business and we re already starting to see a repositioning of inventory not just filling there is also another dimension of destocking with the higher end markets that they reposition their inventory through mix changes and that s why it typically takes a little bit longer for those markets because they since it is product driven and it s some in the case of tile fashion statement they have to purge out and then take a look forward through their s op process what styles will be in demand over the course of the year and that repositioning had to take place and we re already starting to see the build so we feel comfortable that the destocking is over we do see a demand picking up you ll see more of it moving into certainly the second quarter and why do we feel comfortable that we ll deliver again it gets back to our model around our deliveries and commitment of gdp plus 1 to 2 we will continue to drive new products we ve seen in a lot of new application areas we ve seen in color solutions where our growth rate was pretty solid in the fourth quarter and for the year so our expectation again is that we will continue to outperform the market and again last year you saw it with automotive where we are up 7 while the market was down we re going to be up again this year in that space where most of the reports suggest there ll be a contraction in automotive so if you take a look at five or six different sub market segments where we participate we will continue to outperform the market and we are launching a lot of new products this year so we feel very good and confident that we ll deliver what we re saying benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer hey rosemarie the other thing to just to add to what peter said in terms of i think what peter went through was a lot of context around the first quarter versus the other three quarters in 2019 just a data point on the first quarter versus last year is as you recall the euro last year in the first quarter was much closer to 1 21 and 1 22 versus the 1 145 or so that we have in guidance for this year so that 0 36 from last year has got 0 04 or 0 05 of currency in it rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and thanks that is helpful i am assuming that you expect the impact from fx to diminish as the year unfolds maybe in the second half benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer of course yeah as those rates get tighter that will happen in the third and certainly in the fourth quarter rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so peter i apologize if you talked about it but you came out came through very muddled so i couldn t get everything you said so when you talked about the high end tile producers usually having a six to eight months of inventories where do they stand now and where does ferro stand in the products that are sold into that particular market peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so what we ve noticed is a contraction of about 50 through the fourth quarter and through february so they re probably standing on our average estimate at somewhere between three and four months and the expectation is through the course of the year they will ramp up to what would be a traditional amount and that s why we feel comfortable that the volume will be coming back rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and where is your inventory level is it about three to four months as well did you come down at the same rate peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer you mean ours our rosemarie morbelli g research analyst right on ferro s inventory peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer at the customer here rosemarie morbelli g research analyst both places peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes at the customer level they may only take a couple of months of our inventory and they re starting to rebuild their inventory level at that point and as it relates to our tile inventory do we discuss that individually no we don t go through that with each individual let me put it to you this way we ve done a very good job with cash conversion as you ve seen so we have ratcheted down our inventory across all the business segments rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and one last question and then i ll get back in queue could you talk about the countries where you see the most issues in 2019 we know europe is slowing we know asia pacific is slowing or at least china is so if you could give us a little more that would be helpful peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so we see everything that all of our peer group sees in everything you ve mentioned however what i will say again because of our business model we will continue to outperform the markets where we focus today so in china most of what we see is a slowdown of automotive which was very important for us last year at about 14 growth and this year we do expect growth in that area not at the 14 level but certainly above what the pundits ph are suggesting a 2 to 3 growth there so we do feel good why do we feel good is for two major reasons one what you have to think about with ferro is the content forget about i think we need to make sure everyone understand don t focus on inventory don t focus on bills you need to focus on content the more glass that a car has the more demand for ferro glass now i ll give you an example if you look over the past five years ferro s content has increased by 30 because of more glass in a lot of the higher end cars in particular i mean you see a lot of the cars have more glass roofs panoramic roofs ph and that s good for us so focus on the fact that ferro one has developed new products that outperform the competition and number two the demand for our content is very significant and so we feel really good about that both in asia and also europe where you see areas where people believe that automotive is slowing we will not slow down as much the third piece just to give you an example again in mexico which is pretty much truck oriented ferro is the leader in that area for our type of products for truck production that s indigenous to mexico and also export to the us so we feel really good about that particular model and again every one of the businesses i do want to mention this we increased our market share across every business last year and we did it through new product introduction aligned with the market leaders in the spaces where we participate it wasn t done on price and again don t forget that s the backbone of our gdp plus plus model because we re doing it now with the fifth year of a very strong vitality index which means that we have own technology with the market leaders and they typically launch a disproportionate ph amount of new products of course that carries us with it so that gives the math is on our side and it will be again this year as you can see by the growth that we showed between 5 5 to 6 5 and ferro s proxy by the way based on the data the data that we use is about 2 6 2 5 so everybody should feel good about our ability to continue with another four quarters of organic growth operator thank you our next question comes from mike sison of keybanc please go ahead michael sison keybanc capital markets analyst hey guys price mix is going to be a big a bigger plus this year can you maybe walk through which raw materials and maybe which segments will capture that positive price mix benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer sure mike hey good morning for the most part mike we re going to see the benefit in performance coatings that s where we saw most of the headwinds last year so if you think about last year we saw a net headwind of about 9 million most the vast majority of that was in performance coatings in fact the other two businesses were about a push and the tailwind that we ll see this year also we ll see a lot of that reverse around a lot of that we ll see in cobalt we ve seen a significant movement in cobalt from the first two quarters of last year and so the biggest piece of the benefit that we ll see this year will be in cobalt but we re seeing it across a number of raw materials but that s the biggest one michael sison keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then peter can you maybe talk about the acquisition environment and i think your annual goal to pick up 100 million in sales per year how does that look and any particular areas you are focusing on to add to your portfolio this year peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes so i m glad you brought that up this early we want to make sure i think you caught it in ben s prepared remarks where we would talk about always our framework would be 100 million to 150 million of invested capital for our deals and if you noticed last year we introduced the concept of 100 million to 150 million of invested capital in the strategic investments and the reason why we did that is because we knew we were spending more money on our optimization program and also we were buying back stock and because of the sensitivity about the optimization project we didn t really want to bring that up earlier and since we just started to buy back the stock we want to make sure that everyone understands we re being very judicious and prudent about how much money we spend so right now we would look at optimization projects additional optimization projects more stock buybacks here in the near term as well as our acquisitions to account for that 100 million to 150 million of invested capital for let s call strategic investment however that doesn t say last year we spent 75 million in deals that doesn t mean that we didn t have up to 150 million to 200 million because at any point in time we do and we continue to work on a whole range of deals and our pipeline has increased once again and what you ll hear us talk about aside from the 50 we always talk about five that we re always in discussions with which we are we can sit here and honestly tell you that we re engaged with five different activities with discussions but as it relates to the magnitude of the dialog what we ve also decided is that because we have beefed up our m a department and more people are engaged we can probably take on a little more activity around having discussions so that we can increase that vibe a little bit with the idea that we may spend a little more time on looking at things that are not so much to add technology platforms like with the 20 that we ve acquired but something now that s more meaningful around extending the three businesses ok because what we mentioned and this is a very important point that those 20 acquisitions that we did over the past four years if you really dissect them you ll find that as we stated that we were acquiring leadership technology positions that we felt we needed to win moving forward so when we started this journey ferro had a market leadership in about 70 different technology platforms and with the 20 acquisitions we now have 51 and our technology portfolio is very very sound that we believe we ve covered all the gaps that we would feel existed in our leadership positions in a way that for the next three to five to seven years we are going to be in pretty good shape so it s probably time for us to look out at things that might be a little bit bigger not gigantic i m not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of things but maybe something that s a little bit bigger than some of the deals we ve done to put equal time in those as well as the smaller deals just to keep the momentum going so we have about 13 of those right now that we were having conversations internally and externally with so we feel pretty good about the pipeline it still remains rich and we feel very good about that michael sison keybanc capital markets analyst great thank you peter operator thank you our next question comes from mike harrison seaport global securities please go ahead jacob schowalter seaport global securities analyst good morning this is jacob on for mike sticking with m a just wanted to get an update how the integration is progressing on the acquisitions you ve completed over in the second half of 2018 any notable success stories you want to point out peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer the acquisitions are running fine the integrations are fine if you look at we ll be running a make good for our board coming up in april and we were just reviewing it yesterday as a matter of fact and we felt very very good on our presentation to the board on what we ve been able to accomplish in terms of delivering against our synergy commitment remember those 20 deals represent about 150 million of synergies which would be over a five year period at the onset of when we acquired them and what i can tell you without being specific is that we re ahead of schedule with delivering against those synergies and we re not finding anything that s abstract or anything that concerns us and so we feel pretty good on our integration model and our ability to absorb those entities in a very efficient and orderly methodical way jacob schowalter seaport global securities analyst all right and then we ve touched on the destocking in high end tile coatings i was curious the underlying demand trends that you guys are seeing as we move through this destocking period has that sort of stayed stable or has it improved in january and february maybe some comments on the underlying demand peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes so what s really interesting and this is a good point thanks for asking it if you look at our tile business for the year all in on constant currency on a revenue basis it was up 31 8 including the acquisitions but it was up close to double digit regardless even in the fourth quarter so the demand is still there but remember we have a bifurcated kind of a business model with tire where you have high end and we also have the mid cut and there still remains some straggling of lower end and the demand at the lower end in the mid cut continues to continue to be ok through the fourth quarter as you noticed because i mentioned that our revenue and volume was up in the fourth quarter for that business but it was at the high end so the good news is we expect a very very good growth for the tile business again this year all in with all the businesses and as i mentioned to rosemarie we can see that the higher end is starting to pick up and always remember that when things go bad the high end will still be in demand because of the nature of the technology and you re talking about a differential of high end tiles can range on a square meter price spaces anywhere between 25 and 35 a square yet the mid cut that could be 8 to 9 the low cut could be 3 to 5 and even when times are tough people will spend those who have the wherewithal will continue to buy the high end we see no change in that dynamic other than that the stocking that took place mostly because demand did slow down overall in the second half of the year and those inventory levels were built because demand in 16 17 and the first half of 18 were pretty strong and there are a bunch there was a new recently there was a tile show and that s typically where all the new designs take place and that s one of the reasons why things started up so late where all the new fashion was highlighted and put on display and so all those customers are now ramping up with their new product lines so we feel really good about the continued growth in that business because of our leadership position number one we have a low cost position number three we do have the market leadership position in the high end now jacob schowalter seaport global securities analyst all right thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from david begleiter deutsche bank please go ahead david wang deutsche bank analyst hi this is david wang here for david i guess specifically on europe how is the underlying demand by end market and country peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes so as everyone has noted europe we see a general slowdown in europe you can clearly see it particularly with us we would notice it more than anything in the pigment side of the business but relative to what s coming out in terms of gdp growth for europe or by automotive or construction what we can tell you we do see a softness but again compared to with the data coming out in every sub segment whether it s auto whether it s construction whether it s pigments whether it s deco whether it s sensors or whatever we are outperforming the market as it s been presented by the trade documents so we see it but again our model is when things are really good we ll do better when things are soft we won t be as soft and we re clearly seeing that now and i think that s one of the really good things about what we ve created here over the past six years is that in an environment which when things are great we ll do better if things are soft we won t go down as much and that s exactly what you re seeing in 2019 exactly the case that really underscores the value that we ve created this model to withstand headwinds like this and the fact that we have a robust pipeline and optimization activities whether we get it from revenue we certainly have a combined activity around cost management and optimization and greater efficiency and that s what you re seeing in 19 you re seeing the benefit of that major optimization program in addition to continued vitality index of about that 20 that s producing what we believe is a very strong guidance relative to the space david wang deutsche bank analyst thanks and just on q4 color solutions i guess you guys have good positive volume mix number in q4 and you talked about volume down slightly does that mean there is a big mix contribution in q4 for color solutions and if so where does that come from peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer so i think i had mentioned it in my prepared remarks but let me underscore it with our vitality index in all of our r d programs we introduced the topic maybe about a year ago a little more ago that we might have some what we define as being off cycle activities which means that if we have a new product introduction particularly in the high end spaces it takes time for gestation to take place in those spaces because of the high end nature and we introduced some new products in the beginning of the year that are finally starting to gain some traction in the second half of last year particularly in the fourth quarter now moving into this year that we have a hit on and in this case in that business it has to deal with surface technologies and our key our position with proprietary and very interesting and technologically advanced polishing activities that we can t talk too much about but certainly that has helped us in the second half of last year mostly in the fourth quarter because it s starting to ramp up david wang deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john mcnulty bmo capital markets please go ahead bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning this is bhavesh lodaya for john benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer good morning peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer good morning bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst hi so the first one regarding the seven plant rationalization you mentioned what are the segments that should benefit from this the most and can you remind us how the 30 million of profit lift is spread through the divisions peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer here s what we can say on this every business unit that we have will benefit from that optimization activity and if you think about the remarks over the past two and a half years it was more of we are going to create a state of the art kind of a manufacturing capability that stretches across one ferro in a way that makes us the most efficient producer with each one of those market segments with the most contemporary equipment automation our supply chain activities everything is very very efficient and very contemporary so each one of the businesses will benefit from that activity and that s probably something that is very important because we should do that and be the most efficient producer as a market leader around the world bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst got it and then can you speak to the efficiency program in a bit more detail as in like do you have the ability to accelerate that program a bit given the slower macro backdrop right now benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the program continues to be to operate on schedule obviously we re we re pushing that to the sort of as planned the rollout of that the rollout of that new program is important from a cadence perspective so we re actually marching pretty close to what we thought we would bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst got it one final question from my side regarding some of the timing issues you saw in the color and glass business tied to some of your restructuring moves how should we be thinking about that going forward do you foresee any other temporary blips as we progress through the year or was this kind of like a one off peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think what s really important to note is that what you are seeing is that our new product development pipeline program is working extremely well maybe quite candidly a bit better than we might have anticipated and we have a challenge a little bit here that the demand was a little bit greater than we could fulfill in the short term but we are adjusting to it and we ll be able to handle it going forward and a lot that happens a lot with a lot of the new high end technology activities across our businesses that may be let s call it new to the world type activities and not just new to ferro or just new new but new to the world sometimes you have some start up delays and we just have to catch up to it and we had a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter but we feel very good here that we have that under control bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst great thanks for the time kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate relations operator we have time for one last question operator thank you our final question comes from rosemarie morbelli of g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you peter i was wondering talking about your comments regarding acquisitions what are we thinking what are you thinking in terms of potential size of the three nubiola something bigger and how much leverage are you willing to take in this uncertain environment peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer okay so what we re thinking rosemarie again i think you understand the model from the very beginning because you ve been with us and as we started this process we had a lot of discussions back in 12 and 13 about how we needed to build this business to be a successful model that was going to be orderly methodical and we would define different phases and really define a bunch of strategic priorities around those phases in a way that everyone in the company was aligned they were incented around those phases and we would just continue to move to a point where we are today where we completely have a different ferro you can see that particularly last year we had the best year in the history of our company particularly with most of the financial metrics as you know we had double digit and of course our stock doesn t reflect that but of course we did have double digit growth in most of our ph financial metrics but again we re at a point now where we feel very comfortable we plugged all the technology gaps so now it s sort of like we need we want to add some more smaller technologies but we d like to do something a bit more meaningful again maybe i would use nubiola as a case that it would be good to have another nubiola type the financial metrics like that maybe a little bit bigger but nothing that should cause any one a concern because at the end of the day quite candidly rosemarie we worked really hard last year to prove to our shareholders that we are prudent around managing equally the balance sheet and the p l i mean we ve been able to manage this very very well and at the end of the day if you asked us what s important the p l or the balance sheet for the last half of last year and the fourth quarter we would tell you it s the balance sheet we had a commitment of delivering a certain level of cash and we wanted to get our leverage down and we did that so our teams are very good around understanding that dynamic of hey there is a p l time there is a balance sheet time but in the spirit of this we have to keep beating ourselves every year so even in that environment where some may think it was a little abstract for us it shows you the strength of our business model that one we did grow double digits in every financial metric and shame on us for coming out with a guidance last year that was so far more robust than everybody else that you end up kind of getting penalized for it but at the end of the day we delivered a record performance and we delivered the cash we said and we still had strong p l performance so again right now we re in a zone of we have to really really in this environment watch the balance sheet and watch cash we re not going to do anything stupid right ben benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think i would just underscore what peter said there we felt good about where we ended the year last year from a leverage perspective you heard us go through sort of our leverage targets for the end of this year i would say that what s included in those leverage targets is obviously the cash flow guidance we would typically also have cash charges that we would add back to that for optimization and the restructuring charges those charges in 2018 we would expect from a we announced the significant optimization last month we would expect additional capex related to that this year of about 20 million in addition to additional restructuring charges of about 10 million to 15 million and then we have we have charges from a deals perspective to get those synergies of let s say another 10 million to 15 million and what we ve done is we ve built all of that into our leverage targets this year so the leverage targets that we covered on the call we feel really good about including sort of those one time cash charges that i just went through the only thing that wouldn t be included in there is any deal activity and then our share repurchases which to date this year we ve already made 20 million worth of share repurchases so we re very very focused on leverage you will see leverage spike in the first half of the year we could get up somewhere between let s say 3 2 3 3 times in the first half of the year before we then burn that off back to the previously mentioned target so that just underscores sort of what peter was mentioning around our focus around the balance sheet and leverage in particular going forward rosemarie morbelli g research analyst that is great thank you ben and just wondering if you are still comfortable with your 2020 targets benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer yeah we remain committed to those rosemarie as we announced in november of 2017 our expectation was that we would continue the key pillars of those if you would is whatever the market does we re going to do 1 to 2 on top of that and then on top of that from a optimization perspective we re going to get 2 every year and we remain committed to those metrics through 2020 rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate relations we would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today we appreciate your interest in ferro and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter thank you operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today we thank you

the u s economy was steadier than thought at the end of last year but it s probably too soon to give it a clean bill of health for 2019 that s the main takeaway from the shutdown delayed report thursday on fourth quarter gross domestic product which cooled by less than expected to a 2 6 percent annualized gain thanks to surprisingly robust business investment and a stalwart consumer the figures sent treasuries lower and the dollar higher and the federal reserve s patience on interest rates is likely to support growth in coming months but the longest government shutdown in u s history is poised to dent first quarter expansion while slowing global growth president donald trump s trade war and the fading impact of fiscal stimulus together suggest the economy will have a harder time sustaining momentum the gdp report shows that the economy is doing pretty well but it doesn t change any of the risks that the fed has identified said sarah house senior economist at wells fargo co they will continue to be patient fed vice chairman richard clarida echoed that sentiment saying thursday that the central bank can take its time with interest rate moves and noting that measures of inflation expectations appear anchored at the low end of the range he considers in line with the fed s 2 percent goal investors expect the central bank to stay on hold for the year a number of crosscurrents that are buffeting the economy bear careful scrutiny clarida said inflation remained muted in the gdp report adding little urgency for resuming interest rate hikes the fed s preferred price index rose at a 1 5 percent annualized pace last quarter below the central bank s 2 percent goal excluding food and energy the index rose 1 7 percent the report gave the white house an economic milestone to boast about as the republican backed tax cuts helped bring full year growth to 3 1 percent just above trump s 3 percent goal the expansion is poised to become the nation s longest on record at midyear some analysts are taking the gdp data with a grain of salt since they reflect a december retail sales drop that contradicted strong reports from major companies while weakness in a proxy for business equipment spending may have wrong footed economists on the surface these numbers are pretty good said ward mccarthy chief financial economist at jefferies llc but the degree of confidence you can have in all the economic data right now is not what we re accustomed to and not what it should be consumption which accounts for the majority of the economy grew 2 8 percent slightly below forecasts while nonresidential business investment accelerated to a 6 2 percent gain on equipment software and research spending government spending slowed trade was a minor drag and inventories gave gdp a small boost a separate report thursday from the labor department showed filings for unemployment benefits rose by more than expected last week to 225 000 though still near a five decade low other data indicated consumer sentiment rose last week and was close to an 18 year high while business in the chicago region picked up in february as a purchasing managers index jumping to the highest level since december 2017 stephen stanley chief economist at amherst pierpont securities said in a note that consumer spending should remain solid in 2019 and could be stronger than expected given the overwhelmingly positive fundamentals for household finances business investment thursday s report showed the third quarter slowdown in business spending may have been temporary nonresidential fixed investment contributed 0 82 percentage point to growth following 0 35 point in the third quarter business equipment investment rose 6 7 percent and intellectual property spending jumped 13 1 percent yet a question looming over the data is the sustainability of that boost to growth from business investment some of the numbers represent a guesstimate that s subject to revision and may not prove durable anyway according to paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in addition housing remained a weak spot last quarter posting the fourth consecutive drag on gdp growth with a contraction of 3 5 percent at the same time there are signs of demand picking up in early 2019 thanks to a drop in borrowing costs

officer thank you michelle today i ll walk through some earnings data for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2018 results i ll then note some interesting changes in investment preferences that took place in the fourth quarter and how we see the year ahead shaping up in the fourth quarter ladder produce core earnings a non gaap measure of 52 5 million or 0 45 per share this resulted in an after tax core return on average equity of 12 9 for the full year 2018 we had core earnings of 230 1 million or 2 03 per share and after tax core return on average equity of 14 9 we are particularly pleased with our performance this year as core earnings per share increased by 31 8 versus 2017 our undepreciated book value increased by 5 1 during the year to 15 34 per share after announcing two increases to our quarterly cash dividend during the year our multi product model served us well in 2018 as our real estate portfolio accounted for 24 of net investment income while our balance sheet loan inventory contributed to another 61 of net investment income to core earnings you may recall that in our last earnings call we voiced some concerns about general market complacency an overly hawkish federal reserve bank chairman and our view that volatility was likely to pick up as we progress into year end the volatility witnessed in december 2018 was expected and produced an excellent opportunity to make high quality investments in securities as ramp in redemption caused the forced selling of many very safe liquid securities particularly clos and short duration cmbs as we are prone to do during periods of high volatility we purchased a relatively large amount of securities in the quarter totaling 468 3 million we purchased these assets at a discount to par and they have a weighted average maturity of less than three years we match funded many of these purchases by borrowing 288 million in the federal home loan bank at an average fixed rate of 2 89 with an average maturity of two years we ve continued to purchase securities into the first quarter of 2019 adding an additional 187 million over the first two months thus far this year while we are acquiring securities we are also witnessing compression of credit spreads in our balance sheet lending business further shifting our focus away from loan origination and toward securities acquisition during the fourth quarter we received loan payoffs in our bridge loan portfolio of 730 9 million roughly three times what we would normally expect in a quarter while we could have held onto many of these loans by simply matching the terms of the refinancing lender the terms being offered usually with higher proceeds at lower rates didn t seem to offer the right risk reward relationship so we collected are pay off with our exit fees and reallocated our capital into what we felt was a better value proposition for our shareholders we did originate 237 9 million in balance sheet loans in the quarter with a weighted average interest rate of 7 75 and we also originated 182 million of first mortgage loans held for securitization during the fourth quarter we also participated in three securitizations all completed before the volatility in december we contributed 364 8 million of loan earning 7 million i m pleased to report that we have also contributed 170 million of loans to a securitization in the first quarter of 2019 however that securitization has not settled yet we ve seen a slowdown in the pace of repayments of our balance sheet loans receiving just 55 million in pay offs at this point in the quarter this is probably the result of the widening of credit spreads in the clo market and the volatility seen in world markets in december while we embarked on an aggressive plan in 2016 to originate more floating rate bridge loans anticipating higher rates after building upon our loan inventory quarter after quarter the fourth quarter of 2018 marked the first time in over two years that our inventory of balance sheet loans fell quarter over quarter at the end of 2018 we still own 3 3 billion of balance sheet loans but for the first time in years our inventory of securities increased by 44 in the quarter ending the year at 1 41 billion this illustrates how flexible and nimble our investment platform is able to pivot quickly into different product types as changing market conditions produce different investment opportunities as we move ahead into 2019 i would like to note that while we seem to have witnessed the v shape recovery from december 2018 into february of 2019 interest rates still have not returned to where they were in november of 2018 the yield on the 10 year u s treasury is still about 50 basis points lower than it was in november while many may chalk that up to more recent fed commentary that expresses patience when raising interest rates we would also note that the two year rate is inverted against the five year treasury rate and the yield curve is still quite flat and this makes us more cautious about what we think lies ahead in the u s economy we continue to be somewhat concerned about slowing global economy trade wars with china emerging talk of future tax policies that don t seem to support growth a possible hard brexit and growing tensions with russia and while we feel that the economy is stable we think real estate valuations and by extension cash flows may have peaked we will be taking a slightly more cautious approach to lending on transitional loans that require execution and timing in a slowing economy we don t think we ve seen the last of the volatility witnessed in december and we will try to position ourselves to exploit investment opportunities that invariably present themselves when liquidity is thin and sellers are forced to sell high quality assets can meet redemption demands that tend to occur during periods of liquidity i ll wrap up now by saying how happy i am with the performance of 2018 of the company i d like to thank our employees and our investors who supported us throughout the year we look forward to 2019 confident that we re well positioned for the year ahead i ll now turn you over to mark fox marc fox chief financial officer thank you brian i will now review ladder capital s financial results for the quarter and year ended december 31 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder generated core earnings of 52 5 million resulting a core eps of 0 45 and an after tax return on average equity of 12 9 the 2018 calendar year core earnings totaled 230 1 million compared to 178 8 million for the year ended 12 31 17 2018 core eps was 2 2 03 per share compared to 1 54 per share earned in 2017 after tax roae for 2018 of 14 9 surpassed 2017 performance of 11 5 ladder s net interest income from loans and securities investments and net rental income from real estate investments totaled 226 9 million in 2018 and was about 25 higher than the 181 million earned in 2017 increases in recurring sources of income have been an ongoing trend since ladder s ipo in 2014 has allowed us to judiciously increased our quarterly cash dividend rate six times over the course of four years most recently in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a gaap basis ladder generated net income of ladder taxes of 27 8 million in the fourth quarter and 228 3 million for the year ended 12 31 18 the the largest gaap to core earnings adjustment in the fourth quarter related to the timing of the recognition of hedge results to coincide with the realization of gains and losses on a disposition of hedged assets in the fourth quarter ladder originated a total of 419 9 million of loans bringing total loan originations to 2 8 billion ladder s balance sheet loan originations exceeded conduit loan originations in 2018 for the first time since inception at the end of 2018 balance sheet loans totaled 3 3 billion in the conduit loan balance stood at 182 4 million also during the fourth quarter ladder reported income from pre securitization transactions to which ladder contributed 364 8 million principal balance of loans held for sale generating 7 million of securitization gains for the 2018 calendar year ladder securitize a total of 103 loans with a total principal balance of 1 3 billion in nine securitization transactions generating a total of 30 million of securitization gains finally during the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder made 7 2 million of net leased and other equity investments resulting in total net leased and other equity investments of 122 7 million in 2018 ladder also received 5 5 million of net proceeds from sales of condominium real estate in the fourth quarter bringing total proceeds from the sales of real estate to 218 7 million for the year turning to key balance sheet and investment activity metrics as of december 31 2018 96 of our debt investments were senior secured including first mortgage loans and commercial mortgage backed securities secured by first mortgage loans which is consistent with the senior secured focus of the company senior secured assets plus cash comprised 76 3 of our total asset base total assets stood at 6 27 billion which is 4 1 higher than at the end of 2017 total unencumbered investments including cash with 2 1 billion at year end and unsecured debt outstanding stood at 1 2 billion reflecting an unencumbered asset to unsecured debt ratio of 1 79 times the weighted average loan to value ratio of the commercial real estate loans on our balance sheet at the december 31 2018 with approximately 68 inline with prior quarters the most meaningful fourth quarter changes to the asset side of the balance sheet were in the securities and balance sheet loan portfolios during the fourth quarter the securities portfolio increased by 431 8 million instead of 1 41 billion at year end ladder responded to the spread widening and general volatility in the fixed income market by purchasing more securities in three months than the company had acquired in the preceding year at the end of the year the key risk metrics of this portfolio remains in line with historic norms as 80 9 of the securities portfolio was comprised of securities rated aaa or backed by a u s government agency and the weighted average duration was 29 months which compares to 30 months at 9 30 18 and 36 months a year prior also during the quarter ladder received 730 9 million of balance sheet loan repayments more than offsetting 237 9 million of balance sheet loan originations during the quarter the net result was a 3 3 billion december 31 2018 balance sheet loan portfolio versus a 3 8 billion portfolio at the end of the prior quarter the weighted average spread to libor and the floating rate loans in the portfolio was 556 basis points at year end compared to 563 basis points at 9 30 18 on the financing side as of 12 31 18 latter had 3 9 billion of adjusted debt outstanding and committed financing availability of 2 6 billion for additional investments at december 31 2018 debt was comprised of 1 17 billion of unsecured bond debt outstanding maturing in 2021 2022 and 2025 743 9 million of long term non recourse mortgage debt financing our real estate holdings and 601 5 million of non recourse clo debt when combined with 1 64 billion of permanent equity and 176 7 million of other liabilities 4 3 billion or 69 of ladder s capital base is comprised of equity unsecured debt and non recourse non mark to market debt at quarter end we had 1 3 billion of fhlb borrowings with a 2 46 year weighted average maturity and an average cost of 2 55 towards the end of the year ladder further diversified its funding sources entering into a new financing agreement with another major bank that is new to ladder to finance both first mortgage and mezzanine loans this new facility provides 100 million of committed availability and this agreement expands our access to loan repurchase financing to a fixed bank in november ladder also successfully accessed the equity market for the first time since our 2014 ipo we issued 5 8 million shares of class a common stock in an underwritten primary public offering resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately 100 million the shares were issued at a price reflecting a 24 premium over a gaap book value and a 12 premium over undepreciated book value ladder s year end undepreciated book value was 15 34 per share up from 15 25 at 9 30 and up from 14 60 at the end of 2017 finally in the fourth quarter ladder paid a 0 57 per share dividend including 0 34 in cash and 0 23 in shares of class a common stock the 0 34 per share cash dividend reflected a 4 increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate the sixth increase in four years dividends in 2018 totaled 1 535 per share of class a common stock with a cash dividend payout ratio of 64 3 ladder s equity base grew to 1 64 billion at year end reflecting an increase of 155 5 million or 10 in 2018 which resulted from strong 2018 performance in the form of 230 1 million of core earnings the 100 million of primary equity issuance in november ladder s continued adherence to a conservative dividend payout ratio supported by a base of growing recurring earnings and the election to pay a 0 23 per share portion of the 2018 dividend in stock instead of cash thus retaining approximately 25 million of equity in the meantime our asset base increased by 4 1 resulting in 2018 year end adjusted leverage of 2 34 times the lowest leverage level since 2014 the result of all this is that ladder entered to 2019 with over 500 million of available liquidity that can be used to take advantage of the opportunities cited when we issued equity in november applying modest leverage to those available funding could result in a 1 billion to 1 5 billion of additional investment assets on ladder s balance sheet over time so summing up in the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder generated 52 5 million of core earnings 0 45 per share of core eps resulting in a core after tax roe of 12 9 bringing 2018 core earnings to 230 1 million or 2 03 per share of core eps we originated 419 9 million of loans and securitized 364 8 million of fixed rate loans resulting in 7 million of net securitization gains we issued 5 8 million shares of class a common stock and our first underwritten primary public offering since the 2014 ipo resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately 100 million and we paid 0 57 per share dividend bringing total 2018 dividend to 1 535 per share of class a common stock in 2018 at this point it s time to open the line for questions and answers questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven delaney with jmp securities please shoot your question steven delaney jmp securities analyst hey good evening everybody thanks for taking my questions obviously a great report one thing you missed though you didn t say anything about your stock being up 35 since the end of 2017 and that was sort of at the top of my list so congrats on that seriously the other thing you didn t talk about is any recent real estate investments recently had the chance to be with one of your peers who also like you makes opportunistic investments and they were really talking down the ability to put any capital to work this year just because of higher prices and brian i appreciate your outlook on that as far as whether you obviously told us what you think about cmbs but i was just curious if you think you ll still be able to find any special sets because the real estate investment has really created a lot of value over the last couple of years thanks brian harris chief executive officer sure thanks steve and thanks for pointing out our recent success i hope that s not the curse of the announcer but i would say that we are not active in the real estate space for acquisitions in the quarter we haven t been terribly active in the first quarter either and that s not really our core business as you know we re always steven delaney jmp securities analyst oh sure brian harris chief executive officer have fielders out i mean we think that there will be some opportunities but i think the answer to the question is twofold one i think things are very expensive and there s a lot of capital around and two i think that we re probably a little more picky given our view of the economy over the next couple of years and it isn t that we think it s going to be bad necessarily we just don t think it s going to be better so we think that you would have to make a real estate investment today based on cash flows today rather than managing better or raising rents later on so we think the opportunity set for real estate as an asset class is not as strong today however steven delaney jmp securities analyst okay brian harris chief executive officer owning real estate through the debt door in the next couple of years might be a much more interesting proposition steven delaney jmp securities analyst got it and you commented on the loan spreads and being tighter almost sounds like to me even the cmbs spreads have come back and clos everything seems to be somewhat back to normal i mean we ve seen your execution on your cmbs you did with wells last week it almost seems though that securities might continue to be a bigger percentage this year just curious if you would care to comment on that and we had the volatility in 4q but it almost sounds like on a relative basis we could see you continue to grow that book brian harris chief executive officer i think that s accurate i can tell you that december you have to be moving quickly to take advantage of opportunities like that and thankfully we were able to do that we had plenty of dry powder and i think that has continued into january and february i think that we ve purchased another 190 million worth of securities in january and february to date so that would probably get us up to around kind of close to 600 million in the last four months or five months that s a lot for us so we are buying things on the short end mainly because we don t want to be hedging interest rates with all of the cash flow and with the flat yield curve that gets a little bit difficult so you want to be in the two year area two and three year and that s where we ve concentrated our efforts i would say though there if you took a look at almost any financial instrument it was really a v shape recovery right went down in december and then right back up into february but there are a couple of selling differences i don t think the clo market has come back all the way and the reason for that is i think the clo market is it s not broadly distributed the clo steven delaney jmp securities analyst right brian harris chief executive officer paper is really in the hands of a few money managers that are capable of understanding what goes into those things and frankly i think it s a very attractive buy but it was bid pretty tightly i would say into june and july of last year where i thought it was a little too aggressive so we do like that right now we are active purchases of clo aaa aa paper we think it s relatively cheap especially when compared to making libor based loans at relatively tight spreads late in the cycle and so we ll continue to do that as long as that opportunity presents itself and as far as the rest of the business just feels ok we are originating loans maybe not at the pace we are originating at when we felt a little more comfortable with where we were in the cycle but there s still plenty of opportunities i think one of the reasons we allocated some capital to securities it was just a better value trade but i also think that we are a little cautious about lending money to people now at higher loan amounts that at tighter spreads and attempting to get paid back in two to three years where we might be in a bit of a downturn so we are very selective right now about who we re lending money to and we re very selective about what rates we ll charge to lend that money out to people and it does seem like many of our competitors and peers are a little bit more aggressive in the space than we are i owe that to the flexibility of our model where we can easily shift over to securitization and the conduit business as well as mine securities so if we can buy the aaa paper from clo of a competitor at 130 and 140 dm which we were doing in december that looks like a better value proposition than libor plus 300 on loans steven delaney jmp securities analyst understood appreciate the comments brian brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please suit your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much brian i wanted to ask if you could share your thoughts on the co working business model it seems to have taking the leasing market by storm and accounts for as much as i don t know something like a third of leasing activity if you look at the commercial real estate brokers the reporting leasing volumes growth of north of 20 year on year and it s clear that the office sector for traditional occupiers is not growing lease occupancy at that rate so wanted to find out what do you think about that brian harris chief executive officer sure i m not an expert on it first of all but it s clearly the the hotelification of the office buildings taking place and i do agree that a lot of office tenants are not renewing nearly the sizes and space that they used to so there you do have to adapt and i do think that especially for new companies it s a very attractive feature because you don t have all of the you have assistance really in moving into these companies so that makes sense and i think the idea behind the weworks of the world and names like that is you put 10 accounts into a building you really hope two or three of them expand greatly and stay in the building i don t know if that s their business plan but that s what i think they re doing but i as far as a lender i am always cautious when you see space in a headline being leaded by a company that s new and oftentimes not making money that always concerns me a little bit so you have to dig into the financials of that company and to see who s guaranteeing that lease but they re signing because effectively what they re doing is they re mass releasing real estate and that s fine if it s a strong in our company but if it s an llc that just has nothing but that space and the cash flows associated with it i would be very cautious around relying too heavily on that but as a business model and as the as technology makes some real estate obsolete and other real estate more portable i think it s fine idea like most good idea as they get a little overdone and i would suspect that when the largest tenants in a city like new york is a temporary space seller to smaller companies i would flash caution at that jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks for that can you give an update on both credit and migration in the quarter it didn t look like there s any notable change in the loss provision so assume credit was stable in the quarter but also on the couple of credit issues you ve experienced what the status update is on those loans brian harris chief executive officer i would say credit any credit problems bubbling up are very similar to the ones that we ve seen before i think credit problems are occurring in particular in operating businesses like hotels and also in non cash flowing businesses that are being repositioned so if you have a construction loan outstanding and there is no cash flow let s say i don t know call it a 100 million loan and if it s out there at a given rate if you need another year that s a very expensive proposition because you have to put up a full year of interest reserves and when you ve got libor at 2 5 instead of 50 where it was few 2 5 years ago that s quite a bit more but as i said i think it s mostly biting into the equity roes at this point and not necessarily causing debt problems having said that i do think that limited service hotels are probably overbuilt i think that the hotel business as a whole is doing fine but i do think it is there are reminders out there that operating businesses are not all real estate so during the quarter in the fourth quarter we actually did have a situation on some hotels in texas that we thought we were going to foreclose on and we began to make moves in that direction however also due to the fact that there is a lot of capital in the world right now and texas is doing very well we did get paid off in full before and ultimately turned it in from that happened that went round tripping in the fourth quarter that became a conversation became a difficult conversation and then it became a pay off in the beginning of december so i would say credit s stable but showing signs of distress on anything that needs to be extended where the borrower is not particularly well capitalized the other situations we ve had as you know we have an office building that we re now part of reserve in wilmington delaware and not much change there it s been a little bit too soon i think given the way we restructured that whole capital stack and the other one was a food emporium on broadway here in manhattan that is in bankruptcy still it is still 100 occupied by bed bath beyond credit for a long term lease i don t understand why it s in bankruptcy but it is still but it is not of a particular concern to us we re under receivership we re receiving cash flow payments and we re just really waiting for that to sort itself out through the bankruptcy system jade rahmani kbw analyst you mentioned securities purchases to date and you mentioned loan repayments to date what about bridge loan and conduit originations in the first quarter thus far brian harris chief executive officer let me take a quick i ve got a pretty good idea of that do you have it pamela pamela mccormack president yeah marc fox chief financial officer yeah pamela mccormack president right now we look on pace more toward on average kind of growth i would say we re expecting to do 500 million to 650 million broken roughly 50 50 maybe a slightly heavier balance toward balance sheet but i think you can see you can expect to see a more regular quarter from us brian harris chief executive officer and i would tell you so far in the first two months we have closed i don t have the breakout between bridge and conduit but we have closed 334 million worth of loan so far marc fox chief financial officer 190 million were balance sheet loans jade rahmani kbw analyst okay thanks for taking the questions brian harris chief executive officer no problem at all operator our next question comes from the line of stephen laws with raymond james please proceed with your question stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions following it up on the last answer was to jade s question can you maybe talk a little bit about the differences and how you think about the underwriting are the volumes for the loans that you plan to put into the conduit versus those you put it to the on to the balance sheet and i guess maybe start with that brian harris chief executive officer same underwriting process there is no difference same people here underwrite both categories and obviously one of them has more cash flow than others so one of them you might have there have a little bit better predictive ability as opposed to this fully stabilized assets that go into the conduit but again the conduit model you re really underwriting in for rating agency guideline and kind of there is a little bit of variation around it but not that much whereas the balance sheet business you can t overlook certain things that maybe a rating agency wouldn t or you can also decide to penalize an item more then a rating agency would so we re cautious on all of our loans and we use the same process but i would tell you that today as opposed to a couple of years ago in the bridge loan business we are not underwriting the expectation of higher cash flows over the next 12 to 24 months we re underwriting stability and if not possibly down cash flows so we don t necessarily things are going think things are going to get better and then a transitional loan i think we have to live in a world where first of all interest rates might go up and we think they won t but they might and if they do that libor cap only helps until you get to the maturity date and then it has to be refinanced so you have to think a little bit more there is a lot more liquidity in the world so you can take a little bit more risk i think in the execution because if a borrower does execute 75 of its business plan he can probably refinance you even though he hasn t got all the cash flow straightened out but if that liquidity dries up on the refinance pipeline then you d have to be you re in an extension conversation where you re going to ask a bar to write a check with additional equity given 730 million in pay offs in the fourth quarter and i ll tell you december didn t get a lot of pay offs because it was such a volatile quarter so that was a hell of a lot of payoffs in that quarter relative to our existence to date having said that i think december put a real holding that clo model because spreads did widen out quite a bit and as a result of that and as i said we re only we ve only received 55 million in pay offs so far in the first quarter so i wouldn t draw too much conclusion from any one quarter but we are underwriting cautiously going forward on bridge loans as well as conduit loans stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst great thanks for the color on that brian and switching gears to the cmbs side how big we do envision that portfolio getting i mean if the environment stays like it is or was for january and february we continued to add it to add it to the cmbs baskets will that reached 2 billion in cmbs will it go higher kind of you how do you think about your portfolio mix moving through the year given the current market environment brian harris chief executive officer well i try not to put a calendar into the answer i would tell you our desire to do our next transaction oftentimes leads to securities during periods of high volatility and we happen to see that in december i think we ll see it again but i don t quote me on this marc you might be able to help i believe we had a cmbs portfolio of over 3 billion at one point marc fox chief financial officer yeah we were approaching 3 billion yes brian harris chief executive officer so to me again when you make a loan you really own the aaa the aa the singe a and bbb and everything else that goes into a normal securitization so it isn t i don t differentiate too much between loans and securities what securities do is they provide you with a degree of safety and the degree of liquidity and so when you can buy very short term high quality assets that are easily financed easily sold and they produce levered returns in the 8 to 9 area that might very well be a better short term investments than making loans that yield an 11 levered because those loans are not that liquid and so we always sometimes it may not be intuitive but we might take a little bit less in yield to live a little bit more safely so your question is do we see it get to the 2 billion i don t see it getting to 2 billion unless there is another few bouts of volatility but if there was a 60 day about of volatility and still you had to do is watch your tv today and you realize there s plenty of things that can cause that that number could go to 3 billion stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst great appreciate the color on that brian and marc thank you very much brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of tim hayes with fbr please proceed with your question tim hayes fbr analyst hey good evening everyone brian i appreciate your comments on credit quality earlier but i just wanted to pick on credit a little bit more directly do you anticipate a pickup in provisions and or losses in your portfolio this year and how does the fed commentary or your view of rates play into this view brian harris chief executive officer i m sorry jim i didn t hear that can you repeat that tim hayes fbr analyst yeah sure no i was just just got to wanted to pick on credit a little bit more directly just wondering if you expect provisions to increase this year and or losses in the portfolio and then just maybe how your view around with plays into that brian harris chief executive officer i think that there will be more stress again i personally think the fed s next move is down not up i know that s an unusual comment but it isn t because i see anything in particular that s problematic in our portfolio i see things in the economy that are problematic and again i think that there maybe just a little bit too much liquidity right now chasing too few transactions so there might be a little bit of over leveraging of a principal column construction loans is typically something that might get into trouble but excuse me those don t hop and show up until a couple years go by because they have interest reserves right now so i would say answer the question by saying i don t think that we ll see less difficulty in our portfolio or real estate in general but i don t think we re going to see any unusual increases in it either so if there the loan underwritings that have been done over the last few years they re reasonably sane there is a reasonable equity in these transactions so i think that you could easily see some maturity defaults or some restructuring without necessarily seeing a loss associated with it tim hayes fbr analyst understood appreciate the comments there and then the gain on sale margin on the conduit transactions in 4q was pretty low compared to historical levels and just wondering directionally if you d expect the margin to improve on the 1q 19 transaction and to be more in line with historical levels okay the first securitization we did i can t get into too much detail because it hasn t settled however i can tell you that in the fourth quarter and i ll go back even till june from june of 2018 through december credit spreads widened almost every month so every securitization we did in the second half of the year we may have made money we did make money on all of them and we are they were profitable but they were not as profitable as we had hoped they would be and i think we made around that 1 9 in the fourth quarter and we were in three securitizations and all three of them in my opinion didn t do very well but again that s why you build in a bigger margin because you can absorb some spread widening while you re out there in the market going into the first quarter we do see flows of funds and they re in the 7 to 10 year intermediate bond area there s a lot of flows going into those funds so that tells me that a lot of investors are not afraid of the fed raising rates and they re not afraid to buy longer paper even though there s a flat yield curve in addition to that the insurance companies with their fresh allocations have arrived in january they generally like to get through their allocations before the summer and so this is a seasonally aggressive period for lenders there s a lot of competition in the first and second quarters tends to lighten up a a little bit in the second half of the year really after july 4th so it s a little hard for me to say what i think profit margins will be i do think that there is a lack of supply loan demand is not terribly strong but i do think that that flat yield curve fear has left the market at least for the near term so and i ll also give you a little factoid in that these january the securitization we did in 2019 obviously was loans that were closed before 19 interest rates on the 10 year fell dramatically and they have not returned to where they were so the 10 year interest rate on u s treasury is about 10 50 basis points lower today than it was back in november and so when loan when rates fall dramatically like that that s usually good for us even though it does invite more competition but that would be in a high loan demand market which december was not but on the other hand we have floors in our loans and when you have floors in your loans as you re closing them your spreads are effectively widening which should create wider profit margins got it okay and so putting that kind of altogether do you see ladder taking share this year in the conduit market or obviously you ve expressed a lot of caution and more volatility so just given kind of the trends you re seeing now how would you say volumes look like this year versus last year brian harris chief executive officer yeah volume is not a concern of ours its profitability that we search for so i would say i can only really look out a quarter i will tell you i like the conduit business right now i think we re going to do more of it now than we did in the past recently margin seem acceptable there seems to be good supply and demand going on their partners are easy to find bp s buyers are aggressive so there s plenty of reasons why i like that business and honestly in the next last two years this is probably as optimistic as i ve been on that business and that s probably the good part of when you see in 2016 we embarked on an aggressive campaign to add balance sheet loans that were libor based floaters onto our balance sheet adding and adding and adding in anticipation of the fed raising rates and they did exactly what we had hoped they would do today if you fear that they might go down in rates i think you have to think of the other side of that coin too if you like making those loans when libor was going up maybe the definition is slowing it down a little bit if you think they re going down is a concern especially in the late cycle so on a relative value basis last year i told you we loved real estate and we loved bridge loans i would tell you this year we like real estate we love the conduit business and we especially love securities during volatile times so that s the model at ladder right we rotate around the wheel on the products and we are we have moved and the reason i don t want to give you a volume estimate or participation estimate for a full year is we can turn on the dime and so it we can be buying securities and focusing on the conduit business for 90 days and then show up with 1 billion worth of bridge loans tim hayes fbr analyst that makes a lot of sense appreciate the comments around that and then just one more from me real estate operating expenses were down a decent amount quarter over quarter just wondering what accounted for the drop with the balance of the portfolio being relatively flat marc fox chief financial officer yeah that that had to do with the combination of things are the accounting that s surrounding our condominium investments as has changed with respect to the consolidation of the hoas that are involved and also what you see is also the aftermath of us selling the lafayette property last year tim hayes fbr analyst got it okay appreciate you guys taking my questions brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of rich shane with jp morgan please see with your question rich shane jp morgan analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions this afternoon i ll try to keep it quick look i think the you ve done a good job describing sort of the transition in terms of where you want to deploy capital i just want to make sure i understand the securities the transition toward securities two fold one is brian is it fair to say that when you looked at execution on the stuff you were selling you realized it was just simply a better time to be a buyer and that s that drives that inflection brian harris chief executive officer categorically no the execution was fine the only mistake we made was we didn t have enough of them however it s a very easy transaction to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a very short period of time while the whole world is a seller so we just took advantage of that reason because they were simply cheap i wouldn t say this was us not liking another investment it was really the it was more that the product called cusips got attractive it wasn t that the rest of the world got less attractive rich shane jp morgan analyst got it okay that s helpful and brian harris chief executive officer when i look at our products right now bridge loans real estate conduit and cusips i will tell you all of them are on i like every one of those products right now i think that the only expression you re hearing from me on the bridge loan portfolio is competition has heated up there s a lot of capital chasing it credit spreads are tightening into a market where they might maybe should be widening and i m a little concerned about that and if you think that libor is going to fall as opposed to rise you can exit that in one quarter you have to start thinking about that years in advance i don t want to signal to you that we re not originating bridge loans because i d suspect in the first quarter you ll see a resumption of our net add on the balance sheet portfolio because we re not experiencing a lot of payoffs but we are writing plenty of loans but we are a little more cautious in that area rich shane jp morgan analyst cusips are great and again you indicated that the conduit business you expect the conduit business to rebound in this in the first quarter brian harris chief executive officer i do rich shane jp morgan analyst i am curious so is the way to look at this the attractiveness of the securities was a function of being able to deploy capital into larger chunks more quickly and into diversified pools with short durations is that what made it compelling brian harris chief executive officer yes we don t there s much less insurance being paid to hedge interest rates on a short security there s less airplane time and analysis when you re buying aaas and all you had to really do was look at the inflows and outflows and you could see through redemptions that is one of the benefits of this cycle where there s a lot of passive investing what happens is you just see forced redemption going on it used to be hedge funds you would see a lot of volatility and you d make a few calls around town and find out what hedge fund was having a problem now it s an etf usually and so when we re buying a whole lot of clo types aaa bonds there s not that many people that own them so one of my originators said to me who s selling those things they look very cheap and i said it s the people that just bought them because they re only two years old and they said well why would they sell them and the answer is because they have to they re taking redemptions in their funds and so we really like moment like that anytime we see a volatility spike we take a look and we ask a very basic question is this a credit problem or is this a liquidity problem and that looked like a liquidity problem to us if we ever saw one rich shane jp morgan analyst so it was much more of a tactical call than the strategic call brian harris chief executive officer it was an opportunistic call yes rich shane jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jill o dwyer ph with ltc partners please proceed with your question jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst hey everybody good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions you raised capital to equity sales which of course stayed with management stake and you raised that for some opportunistic things that were out in the marketplace i m just wondering after you raise that capital and leverage it if you feel like you ve expanded at all now in terms of where you thought those opportunities were going to be brian harris chief executive officer we have a reasonable amount of dry powder we don t think that that december situation is necessarily over we take our cue from the inverted five year and two year as potentially problems ahead and some of the rhetoric coming out of washington right now so we think that there will be some other opportunities and we did raise that small amount of capital really as a hybrid almost as i mentioned in the original call that when i was talking about the quarter we thought rates were low and we borrowed fixed rate fundings from the federal home loan bank of over 280 million and but we originally started by simply buying securities to hold that so that there was no drag effect and no j curve on those funds that we had borrowed because it is secured borrowing but we borrowed the other 100 million for a few reasons one is we felt like we unpacked i think we even said it on the third quarter call that we thought we d be buying securities because we thought volatility would be increasing and we did not have to wait long until it happen have we expanded all of it well we took 700 million in payoffs also so the original plan of the 100 million that we borrowed coupled with the borrowings at the federal home loan bank yes we ve expanded that however with 730 million in payoffs on the bridge loan portfolio we have some cash around but we will it may take a quarter but i don t think it ll be too hard there s plenty of opportunities right now jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst okay thank you and then just curious in terms of playing off what you said in terms of kind of things are expensive there s a lot of capital available like technical difficulty our liquidity in the marketplace i was wondering how that s impacting to your thought process on net lease acquisitions and even more specifically and maybe what you re doing with the dollar general acquisitions and just kind of how that whole thought process is played into the way you re looking in that marketplace brian harris chief executive officer well the marketplace of net lease i think is a difficult place to say you re going to add a whole lot in right now and the main reason being your cost of funds has dramatically increased relative to where the cap rates are on many of those things that are selling you do have the amazon effect taking place in some of those retailers i would argue that rather than talking about the net lease space i d rather talk about the dollar general space and dollar general is one of our favorite companies right now and there s a lot of reasons why we prefer to buy dollar generals one is that there are hundreds of them and you can be rather selective around where you want to buy them two is that trying to word it delicately the dollar general customer is not necessarily the amazon prime customer so and they re oftentimes in less populated areas so less likely to be trafficked by the big retailers that are mostly shrinking as opposed to expanding into areas like that and another thing that we like to do is dollar general has been around for a long time and what the dollar general is doing is they re moving out of a lot of their inline stores and moving right across the street into stand alone source and we like that because we know that they know their customer so they wouldn t be making that move unless they understood they could support it and lastly there is a high barrier to entry to buying dollar generals because the average dollar general costs about 1 4 million so by the time you get through with appraisers and engineers and environmental and lawyers you can get through a pretty big legal bill on a 1 4 million asset so if we were buying one of them i wouldn t do it but when you buy 100 of them that s a very attractive proposition because you do get them at a slightly wider cap rate because of the expense factor that goes with it we don t absorb quite the expenses that other people do jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst right and i appreciate that and i feel the same way you do about dollar general for all those same reasons i ve looked at the dollar general portfolio pretty extensively and it s pretty wise just my last question is you saw a loan book run off and then the need to redeploy that capital i m just wondering if we enter an environment where despite what s happened in the first quarter where you hadn t really had a loan book run off but if we get into future quarters where you re having a loan book runoff just kind of wondering how you guys have thought about replacing that and if you say rotating into other areas if you feel like if and when the loan book runs off will you be able to rotate into these other areas to keep your core growth going brian harris chief executive officer well we think we will be able to but that doesn t mean we will be able to we don t determine those opportunities those are determined by the market but there s always other things we can do one we can give it back to our shareholders if we feel like it but if we re last year we developed during a year where cash was considered the best investment where bonds were down stocks were down we delivered a 14 9 roe when we re delivering an roe like that or even we tend to shoot for as we ve said many times 9 to 10 without anything fancy going on but if we can make a double digit return on equity and we can do that rather easily from what i can tell at this point anyway if it continues like this as long as we can do that we ll just keep investing and rotating around our product mix however if for some reason it got to the point where we didn t think we could deliver a return like that we would probably opt to start giving money back to shareholders rather than trying to fund loans that didn t cover our dividend jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst okay appreciate the conservatism you guys are bringing into the marketplace because we re not really seeing that in too many other areas operator our final question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks just wanted to ask your thoughts on the new york city condo market how much of a concern is the oversupply right now and the decline in demand do you anticipate it to result in distressed projects and could that be an opportunity for ladder brian harris chief executive officer that s an interesting question i don t know how it will be more negative on it than we are we are not comfortable with new york city condos as an investment right now it doesn t mean they won t become a very attractive investment in fact one thing that could change our mind very quickly is if the state and local tax deduction were restored and we think it might be or if it was even raised to 30 000 instead of 10 000 we think that that event alone has really caused a big problem in the space and that could be easily reversed so i don t know if i call that a market condition or a legal condition but it is problematic for sure and that s where i am very concerned i think about residential housing let s not talk about new york city condos let s talk about new york new jersey connecticut and california because i think that there are many factors at work right now in those states that would cause me to be very concerned about any form of positive view toward residential property values jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator this concludes our question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back over to

discuss the progress made across various businesses dan will then discuss the financial and operational results in greater detail as well as our outlook for 2019 after which we will open up the call for your questions as you saw from this morning s earnings press release top line results for the fourth quarter was slightly below expectations in large part due to continued helium supply pressures that unexpectedly persisted from november and to a lesser degree into december gross margins were in line with expectations and ebitda and eps were at the low end of our expected ranges as we exercised disciplined cost control for the full year consolidated revenues grew 2 4 gross margins declined 20 bps with ebitda and eps totaling 400 million and 1 61 respectively we generated strong cash flow of 315 million for the year which allowed us to complete significant franchisee acquisitions while also investing in the businesses and opportunistically repurchasing shares looking back at 2018 it was an important foundational year for the business in which we made meaningful progress against several growth strategies that will strengthen the businesses in 2019 and beyond starting with the retail business sales grew 4 3 for the year reflecting the further execution of our omnichannel strategy we continued focusing on improved consumer shopping experiences across both brick and mortar as well as online this focus included completing phase one of retail productivity initiatives within the party city stores thereby improving the operational performance of the stores simplifying store operating procedures improving the flow of product and optimizing labor the sales associated with these initiatives have served as a catalyst for reinvestment into the party planner program as to level enhancing our level of customer service and customer experience at the end of the year the party planner program was in 150 stores and the positive results clearly demonstrate the opportunity for us to grow the basket to create a customer engagement and higher quality of service in 2018 we also strengthened our seasonal product offerings with a wide variety of refresh assortments at halloween city we supported a better curated inaudible for the temporary store consumer with the larger offering of animatronics thereby creating greater in store theater additionally we expanded the assortment in certain stores to include a selected toy offering these changes helped drive meaningful comp sales in our temporary stores touching for a moment on the toy pilot the results were mixed the performance of the 50 toy city temporary stores did not meet our early on expectations however we are very encouraged by the results seen in the permanent stores where we piloted ph a number of tests for the toy category including expanded in aisle presence and front end in and out programs while we are still evaluating the full opportunity for this category there is little doubt that toys can play a role in strengthening our overall offering we also made meaningful improvements to our e commerce business in fiscal 2018 we completed and launched the broader site replatforming that included improved product creative and site content this replatforming has resulted in better usability easier check outflow and a more faster browsing experience for consumers especially when using their mobile devices we also leveraged this technology to support the consumers desire to seamlessly shop the category through the expansion of our buy online pick up in store program as well as improved product availability checks online in october we announced the expansion of our digital initiatives with the creation of a party city branded storefront on amazon marketplace this move has allowed us to further expand the reach of our brands and unique product offerings while complementing the partycity com website within the amazon storefront we initially focused on a curated offering for halloween and then broadly assortments to include christmas and new year s products and recently we have broadened the offering to include a selected everyday product offering as well largely this offering is in the form of coordinated kits as we leverage our position as the leading manufacturer supplier and retailer of consumer party goods these e commerce improvements have been well received by consumers reflected by improved traffic to our sites increased conversion rates and accelerated growth rates when including the impact of bopis e commerce comps for the fourth quarter and full year were 33 and 18 respectively turning for a moment to the consumer products businesses while the earlier shortages in supply chain disruptions in the second half of 2018 affected our consolidated top line performance the total consumer products business on a pro forma basis increased about 1 the north american consumer products business gained significant new customers in both the grocery and mass channels which helped partially offset continued sluggish franchise and independent party specialty retail performance the north american consumer products business was also successful in continuing to increase distribution into non traditional party channels or alternative channels including movie theaters zoos sporting and entertainment venues the results we ve seen from increased focus on leveraging of our personalized products capabilities as well as newer channels has been very encouraging internationally the consumers products businesses have deepened the relationship with key retailers in australia europe the u k and mexico education and curation assortments are creating inroads in many new markets we continue to see an opportunity for us to increase our overall global presence the kazzam marketplace pilot remains as part of our broader future digital strategy in the fourth quarter we achieved the goal of going live in about 15 markets at the end of the year our inaudible is that the broad proof of concept has been met and we are aggressively moving to second stage of this pilot focused on customer acquisition plans for 2019 include utilizing the full suite of party city assets to build awareness drive traffic and exploit the intersection of our marketplace and retail businesses we are now deploying at about 15 of our stores a combination of in store initiatives as well as digital efforts and limited above the line marketing to drive consumer awareness and help scale the business based upon the results we anticipate further market rollout later this year and i look forward to sharing the results as kazzam comes to life and becomes a reality in addition to kazzam in 2018 we invested heavily to improve and expand our crm capabilities these efforts have and will continue to allow us to gain a deeper understanding of our consumer and create more targeted marketing campaigns delivering a more personalized experience for our consumers we ended 2018 with a customer database of over 25 million identifiable customers representing 40 years of purchase data it is this growing database that we will leverage to create more personalized experiences for our customers we continue to optimize the effectiveness and the mix of our marketing spend working dollars increased 3 year over year despite spending remaining essentially flat these efforts include diversifying away from traditional media venues and increasing our digital spend and promotional advertising which increased 25 year over year in 2018 with unaided brand awareness over 70 the marketing dollars we deploy must be done so in conjunction with our enhanced crm targeting capabilities and really focus on driving uniqueness for the customer like all retailers we have been faced with heightened inflationary pressures in 2018 however our bottom line results for the year demonstrate the clear benefits of our differentiated vertical model the self manufactured share of shelf expanded by 30 points in 2018 and productivity improvement initiatives helped partially mitigate these inflationary pressures limiting gross margin decline to 20 bps for the year dan will discuss this in more detail shortly the vertical model also provided the business an opportunity to mitigate the potential impact of the tariff policy on the business if the 25 tariffs were to go into effect at some future point in time we have largely addressed and essentially mitigated the potential 12 million annual run rate headwind this has been accomplished in large part through a combination of product reengineering accelerated resourcing efforts and increasing the self manufactured share generally in our factories in north america i am extremely proud how our consumer products teams have moved quickly and effectively to leverage our best in class capabilities to meet this significant operational challenge timely and highly accretive retail acquisitions were a core component of our growth strategy in 2018 and we completed the acquisition of 58 franchise and independent stores across maryland pennsylvania minnesota north dakota and texas in 2018 as we said before these acquisitions further expand our corporate footprint at very attractive cash and cash multiples and 2018 provided a unique moment for us to accelerate these acquisition efforts going forward we expect the pace of retail store acquisitions to significantly decrease and we will prioritize debt pay down as we focus on our leverage ratio goal of between 3x and 3 5x by the end of 2020 so in summary 2018 top line results were slightly below expectations due in part to the temporary headwinds but through a control of costs and by leveraging the vertical we delivered bottom line results at the low end of our guided range we made meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives to strengthen the business and we are well positioned in 2019 as the calendar turns favorable with halloween moving to a thursday and with what we believe to be a very strong license portfolio in the year ahead the 2019 strategic objectives for the businesses are clear one drive meaningful organic growth two expand the vertical as we produce source and distribute more efficiently and improve the overall operational performance of the business and finally most importantly strengthen the balance sheet for long term success of the business critical investments in support of our top line objectives have been made and the business is poised for sustainable comp sales growth process adjustments have been instituted to improve operational efficiencies and the capital investments in manufacturing distribution made in 2018 are set to yield the anticipated benefits but once again rest assured we remain firmly committed to accelerating our pay down debt all of which supports our focus on creating long lasting shareholder value before i close i d like to acknowledge the announcement made today that dan sullivan has decided to pursue another opportunity elsewhere and will be leaving the company on march 22nd i would thank dan for his commitment and dedication to pchi over the past 2 5 years he has built a strong and a capable finance organization and helped drive our retail productivity initiatives we wish dan all the best in his future endeavors as a result of dan s departure we have also announced that michael correale our chief accounting officer who served as our cfo for 14 years from 2002 to 2016 has accepted the position of interim cfo allowing for a seamless transition until a permanent replacement for dan is identified mike s knowledge of the business and experience will provide a steady set of hands and now i d like to turn the call over to dan to discuss the fourth quarter and full year results and the 2019 outlook in greater detail daniel j sullivan chief financial officer thanks jim it has been a wonderful 2 5 years at party city and i m privileged to serve the company and our shareholders i am extremely proud of the tremendously talented finance organization that has been built and i m confident that the organization is well positioned for continued success now turning to the results as you heard jim mention 2018 was an important foundational year as we made critical investments across the business to enhance our position as a world class vertically integrated retailer there were a few unexpected transitory issues which we ve discussed and which i ll elaborate on in a moment that transpired in the back half of the year that negatively impacted the top line and pressured gross margins at both retail and wholesale that said even with these operational headwinds we still reported eps and ebitda within our updated guided range for the year for fiscal 2018 revenues increased 2 2 on a constant currency basis gross margin rate declined 20 basis points as expected adjusted ebitda declined 2 and adjusted eps increased to 1 61 from 1 24 inclusive of share repurchases and the benefit from tax reform as well as the headwind associated with higher interest expense and we once again generated strong free cash flow of 315 million our fourth quarter top line results were impacted by persisting helium pressures that at times were a significant headwind for both our balloon business and juvenile birthday business negatively impacting both our retail comps as well as well as our consumer products sales despite sluggish revenues in the quarter in part also impacted by the new year s eve shift the year over year decline in gross margin was in line with expectations and eps came in toward the middle of the range driven by solid cost control looking more closely at fourth quarter results consolidated revenue grew 2 on a reported basis or 2 5 when adjusted for currency in our retail segment sales increased 4 5 in constant currency largely a result of the acquisition of franchise and independent stores over the last 12 months as we added about 8 in retail square footage in 2018 almost entirely through acquisitions at quarter s end our store network totaled 962 stores 866 of which were corporate stores our brand comparable sales which include our u s and canadian permanent stores and north american e commerce business declined 2 9 this reflects an approximate 150 basis point impact from the helium shortage that persisted from q3 in addition as we expected the headwind of the new year s eve shift was about 110 basis points implying an underlying comp for the quarter absent of these two factors of down slightly underlying comp sales performance strengthened as the quarter progressed and seasonal comps in december were positive despite the new year s eve shift with the christmas season up over 20 as customers responded well to our new christmas and hanukkah designs and updated assortments our web business remained a bright spot in the quarter increasing 12 in q4 or 33 when adjusted for bopis turning to the non vertical consumer products businesses net revenue increased 30 basis points in q4 after adjusting for the impact of franchise and independent acquisitions and foreign exchange as we cycled last year s 4q constant currency organic growth of 12 international consumer products declined approximately 1 8 in constant currency despite mid single digit growth in our core commercial markets this decline was partially due to continued sluggish results in our direct from plant fob business combined with the tough comparison to prior year period when we saw 20 international growth importantly we continue to strengthen relationships with key retail partners in our core international markets and have leveraged our strong positioning in the foil balloon category which drove continued growth in australia europe and mexico on a two year basis we have seen quarterly growth of about 18 the domestic consumer products business continues to be challenged due to soft franchise and independent performance and declined 1 1 adjusted for acquisitions as we cycled 10 growth from last year in q4 the declines were largely a result of the american greetings decision to exit the category a sluggish wednesday halloween and declines in the gift business importantly the alternative markets channel increased about 5 on a run rate basis in the quarter and reflects key wins in mass and grocery most notably with target michaels and krogers as expected our consolidated gross profit margin was 45 3 or 160 basis points below the same quarter last year and in line with our expectations almost 100 basis points of the decline was attributable to the operational headwinds that we previously discussed on our q3 call this was related to supply chain disruptions associated with the surge in demand for moving product out of china ahead of tariff implementation resulting in incremental freight distribution and labor costs that were largely realized in q4 additionally we continued to experience increased inflationary pressures associated with freight and distribution costs and saw some negative impact as a result of higher helium costs in terms of both sourcing and negative product mix finally as we previewed in our 3q call we shifted promotional spend from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in support of our holiday execution all of these headwinds were partially mitigated by the continued execution of our retail productivity initiatives overall share of shelf decreased 160 basis points primarily due to the negative impact on halloween from q3 s operational issues getting product out of china manufacturing share of shelf also decreased 160 basis points to 16 6 also driven largely by the negative helium shortage impact on balloon sales normalizing for the helium issue the operational challenges already discussed and the new year s eve shift manufacturing share of shelf was just over 18 and flat to last year s q4 operating expenses as a percent of revenue leveraged 20 basis points year over year largely reflecting the continued labor productivity efforts at retail and the reduction in management incentive costs in our retail business we saw labor rates improved by 40 basis points fueled by 70 basis points of benefit from the scaling of our productivity initiatives and we ve already begun piloting the next phase of our work for 2019 we are redeploying the savings from our productivity initiatives into the party planner program which we now have in about 150 stores with about 70 stores having been launched late in 3q overall we re continuing to see about a 1 to 2 comp lift versus the rest of chain with stronger results in the more mature stores we continue to improve this program by strengthening the labor model enhancing our training program reducing associate turnover and continuing to modify the underlying incentive schemes to drive performance we are seeing the benefits of these improvements in our customer satisfaction and net promoter scores which continue to strengthen with the holidays now behind us we ll further evaluate and scale the program over the course of 2019 reported income from operations was 158 8 million or 19 7 of net revenue compared to 167 4 million or 21 2 of net revenue in the prior year period with the decrease due to lower gross margins interest expense for the fourth quarter was 29 2 million or 7 million above the same quarter last year with the increase equally attributable to increased borrowings under our abl facility the impact of increasing libor rates on both our term loan and abl facility and the high yield offering that was successfully executed in august in the quarter our reported effective tax rate was impacted by a non recurring adjustment related to tax reform our adjusted effective tax rate was 25 4 adjusted net income of 103 4 million increased 9 9 compared to last year s fourth quarter and adjusted eps increased to 1 08 per share from 0 81 per share the 2018 results are inclusive of tailwinds from tax reform and a reduction in our share count through our share buyback activity partially offset by higher interest expense year over year adjusted ebitda decreased about 4 versus the fourth quarter of last year to 188 9 million turning to our full year results consolidated revenue was 2 43 billion which represented growth of over 2 on both a reported and constant currency basis retail operations posted a 4 3 increase on both a reported basis and in constant currency driven largely by increased store count during the year we acquired 58 franchise and independent stores and opened five net new stores reported comps declined 70 basis points for the year while on an adjusted basis excluding the unique headwinds of helium shortages the operational issues getting product out of china as well as the tailwinds of lapping hurricanes and the seo issues over a year ago underlying comps were essentially flat our e commerce comp sales increased 18 when including bopis sales our non vertical consumer products revenue increased 0 3 after adjusting for the impact of franchise acquisitions and foreign exchange largely reflective of american greetings decision to exit the category and the continued deterioration of the independent and franchise business in part a reflection of a wednesday halloween the alternative markets business grew 9 on a run rate basis for the year and we are encouraged by the growth seen not only in mass and grocery but also on the promotional and experiential channels which we will continue to focus on in 2019 our international consumer products business grew 1 7 for the year on a constant currency basis driven by almost 9 constant currency growth in our core markets of australia europe the u k canada and mexico we continue to exploit our full product assortment with growth being driven by innovative merchandising product development and category management with key retailers gross margin rate declined 20 basis points for the year despite continued productivity gains at retail the margin declines were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs and higher costs from the q3 operational issues related to getting product out of china negative product mix and commodity and labor inflationary pressures were additional though less meaningful headwinds we increased manufactured share of shelf 30 basis points to 22 9 and estimate this increase to be 100 basis points year over year when adjusting for the negative effects of the items discussed earlier operating expenses were 713 9 million which were higher by about 17 7 million or flat as a percentage of revenue versus 2017 primarily due to the improved labor productivity management better expense management and lower incentive costs at retail we realized a 60 basis point improvement in direct labor rates largely as a result of the maturation of our first phase of labor productivity initiatives interest expense was 105 7 million compared to 87 4 million last year with the increase attributable to the increased borrowings under the abl the impact of increasing libor rates on both our term and abl and to a lesser degree the recent high yield offering that was successfully executed in august our reported effective tax rate reflects a non recurring adjustment related to tax reform and for the full year this rate was 25 adjusted net income was 156 8 million or 5 5 above last year resulting in adjusted eps growth to 1 61 per share versus 1 24 per share in the prior year period the 2018 results are inclusive of tailwinds from tax reform a reduction in our share count due to our buyback activity and partially offset by higher interest expense and kazzam investments year over year adjusted ebitda for the year was 400 1 million versus 409 2 million in the prior year finally for the year we delivered free cash flow defined as adjusted ebitda less capex of 314 million a decrease of 28 million or 8 versus 2017 primarily due to increased capex of 19 million in support of our web replatforming and productivity efforts at retail and in our main distribution center cash flows from operations was a source of 102 million including a working capital use of 125 million which was largely a reflection of increased inventory levels in part due to softer than expected halloween sales capex totaled 86 million while we allocated 40 million toward stock repurchases and 65 million toward acquisitions we ended the year with net debt of about 1 9 billion resulting in a debt leverage ratio of 4 7x with about 1 10th of a turn as a result of our share repurchase program at the end of the quarter we had approximately 210 million available in our existing asset base revolver before i discuss our 2019 guidance i wanted to note a few items impacting our outlook as jim said there were a few tailwinds in 2019 including the shift to a thursday halloween and a more favorable licensed property calendar which is most relevant for our juvenile party and costume businesses our comps guidance for the year contemplates further helium supply constraints anticipated to be at current levels and which are likely to disproportionately impact half one due to business seasonality and the fact that we will cycle 2018 supply issues which began in august of last year further our quarterly comps outlook reflects calendar favorability in q1 due to new year s eve shift and is partially offset by the negative impact of easter shifting into q2 overall we expect half one comps to be flat to slightly negative we expect the benefit from supply chain investments we made ahead of and following the disruptions that impacted the business in 2018 while inflationary pressures are expected to persist most notably related to freight and helium we anticipate gaap operating income margin to be slightly positive when compared to 2018 rates largely reflective of slightly positive gross margin rates we expect interest expense to be in the range of 115 million to 120 million for the year with that said for fiscal 2019 we expect revenue to be in the range of 2 488 billion to 2 538 billion and comp sales to be up about 1 we project full year adjusted net income to be in the range of 152 million to 162 million or 1 61 to 1 72 per share we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 405 million to 418 million in terms of capital allocation priorities we expect to spend about 2 8 of net revenue on capex which is down from approximately 3 5 in 2018 and we anticipate ending the year with a net debt leverage ratio of 4 1x for all other detail around our outlook please refer to our press release and with that i d like to turn the call back over to the operator to open up the call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from matt mcclintock from barclays your line is open matthew mcclintock barclays analyst hi yes good morning everyone and best of luck dan daniel j sullivan chief financial officer thanks matt matthew mcclintock barclays analyst two questions the first one is just helium could you just give us your broader perspective on the helium shortage there s been a lot of news over the course of last month that the helium shortage is getting is intensifying and can you just talk about how your sources of helium are i guess locked in or provide you with some type of view that you will be able to get that product thanks james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure matt so i think as you recall in our third quarter call we called out helium and it was our expectation and it was the expectation of those who were experts that the situation would stabilize and begin to resolve itself obviously it continues to persist and as dan mentioned in our comps we ve projected a continuance of the helium situation at its current levels as we look at the full year from a percentage standpoint currently we re operating at about 60 to 70 of our average allocation for helium and that bounces around quite a bit based upon the time of the month and just general availability we ve done a number of things to the source helium from additional resources outside of our standard contract relationship and as a result of that we ve been able to bring the average up to about 70 as we look at typically what we need to really satisfy our demand vis a vis our allocation of our contract we need about 80 to 85 so there s about a 14 give or take through headwind and the availability to us of helium on a day in and day out basis but like i said over the course of a month or a week it can vary from anywhere from 50 stores having helium issues to over 200 stores having helium issues as we look for the longer term as those of you know and have heard me talk about helium in the past there s plenty of helium in terms of known reserves the constraint really today is really supply chain and refining capacity it s very well documented in a number of articles where that refining capacity is being built and the causes for the shortage in the refining capacity being primarily the influence of the government s decision to continue to reduce helium out of the blm years ago and calamities that inhibited investment in refining capacity so as we look at the full year we expect helium to continue to be a headwind we believe our comp guidance incorporates enough of a quantification of that headwind that we still conservatively believe that we can be in the range of flat to slight 1 comp hopefully that s helpful matthew mcclintock barclays analyst extremely helpful jim thank you very much and just i guess as a clarification question on the comp guidance one for the full year i believe that s similar to your comp guidance as you entered last year or 2018 and so i guess my question is does the helium headwind offset the benefit of a more optimal timing of halloween and that s what you have the similar guidance as you began last year thanks james m harrison director and chief executive officer i think fundamentally that s probably a very down and dirty quick analysis of the situation obviously there s a great number of puts and takes within our guidance and within our projected probably comp for the year obviously the operational issues that we highlighted in our third quarter call we ve taken tremendous strides and steps to make sure that we are ahead of that curve we don t anticipate that sort of drag on comps in 2019 and there are like i said there are a number of puts and takes but the easiest way of thinking about it is yes we moved to a strong calendar on halloween we moved to strong properties and the helium mitigates the full impact of what that normalization normally would have provided us matthew mcclintock barclays analyst thank you very much for the color operator your next question comes from simeon gutman from morgan stanley your line is open simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys my question is on ebitda guidance for the growth that s embedded in the guidance year over year so we know you re lapping investment from 2018 you mentioned some non recurring consulting costs i don t know if you quantified some operational headwinds and now and we know helium even though it sounds like it will linger a little bit in the first half and then jim you just mentioned the better licensed product and i would guess halloween should be no worse than a push relative to this year so looks like the ebitda growth that s implied it s muted for conservatism or there s just a lot of cost that s still holding on in the business daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes simeon it s dan i would maybe highlight two things one is our outlook on gross margin and we should not ignore the helium impact on gross margin what we ve said is we expect gross margins to be flat to slightly positive versus a year ago helium will represent about a 30 basis point headwind to margins in the year equally sort of balanced between higher cost to secure helium and the negative effect on mix that s selling less balloon have so you have to start with our gross margin outlook i think the other piece that i would call out is the ti impact year over year we continue to have less and less ti addbacks to our ebitda which we are cycling about 5 million less in addbacks in 2019 than we were in 2018 which makes the flow through of ebitda look a little bit skewed but doesn t actually change sort of how we think about the year simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst okay and then just related to balloons and helium can you tell us when you if you when you make money on a balloon are you making money marking up the balloon and the helium or is it just one side of it and have you considered raising prices on balloons james m harrison director and chief executive officer to answer that question the answer to the question is not only have we considered it we ve actually done it to mitigate some of the headwind on the helium we don t really mark up the helium per se the helium is part it s similar to the labor to fill the balloon and make the put the ribbon on the balloon that s all incorporated within the cost of executing the sale of a inflated balloon but we have looked at pricing on our balloons to adjust for the increased cost of the helium but with increased prices obviously there is a put and a take that occurs at retail in terms of the consumers perceptions to how many balloons they re going to buy and just following up on your earlier question a little bit about the calendar shift and the impact of the store licensing it s interesting to note that as we mentioned in our third quarter call the proportion of our business that we saw really most affected by this most recent halloween was not necessarily the adult business which you generally expect to be substantially affected by the midweek halloween but actually the girls business due to the absence of strong properties so as we think about this shift to thursday and the impact of that really that coupled with the girls shift is really what s going to drive the halloween business as opposed to what one normally would have expected to be a larger portion of the assortment being purchased by the adult category so while there s two benefits there they basically merge into one simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst got it okay thanks jim dan good luck daniel j sullivan chief financial officer thanks simeon appreciate it operator your next question comes from mike baker from deutsche bank your line is open michael baker deutsche bank analyst hi thanks just to touch on these issues again and i guess throughout the year you ve given us an update or at least some data we could probably try to back into it but i ll just ask your view on that can you order all the issues that have happened in 2018 which impacted you the most in terms of halloween the helium poor licensing the tough china issues even freight costs i mean there are like five or six things what was the most impactful in your mind daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes mike so it s dan i think you have to separate it between are you talking topline impact or gross margin impact right certainly from a topline standpoint comps in particular we would obviously say the issue is getting product out of china and therefore affecting our halloween business would be first and foremost on the list and then secondarily helium while it had an impact in q4 which we ve estimated to be 150 basis points of comps headwind on a full year basis obviously far less than that if you talk about gross margins and full year rate the freight and distribution costs would be first on the list because that s a a structural issue that has been with us for the entire year and drove about 35 to 40 basis points of headwind against margins again from a timing point of view the issues getting product out of china was limited to the fourth quarter it had a meaningful impact on the quarter we ve said about 100 basis points year over year but far less on a full year so hopefully that answers your question michael baker deutsche bank analyst yes it does and following up the freight and distribution costs of 35 to 40 ph is that including the china issue or is that separate just higher freight rates and the like daniel j sullivan chief financial officer no it s a separate michael baker deutsche bank analyst understood and do we expect that to dissipate at all in 2019 some spot rate and contact rates have already come down a little bit or are you planning for that same type of a tailwind or headwind i should say in 2019 james m harrison director and chief executive officer we are anticipating it to be a continuing headwind to the magnitude that it was this past year we are not expecting a real loosening on freight at anytime soon there have been a number of bankruptcies of freight carriers recently in this quarter even so we don t anticipate freight loosening up substantially michael baker deutsche bank analyst okay understood if i could ask one more maybe more of a positive question the party planner initiative seems like it s gone pretty well it s in 150 stores you have sort of been reluctant to talk about the pace of the roll out but any color on how many more stores we expect to see that in 2019 eventually this can this be in all stores and is there enough efficiencies to offset those costs still to go james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure i ll start and i ll ask ryan vero our president of pricing and retail to chime in essentially in terms of rolling it out to all stores that would not make sense what we are doing is we are look at ways of utilizing technology at various levels at store level and also broadening the training of our associates so that we don t have a bifurcated group who is simply focused on customer engagement really our goal and ryan can certainly enhance this conversation is to really create a service orientation throughout our retail organization so that we are less dependent on a single party planner to be the face of the customer engagement initiative but rather broaden the customer engagement initiative across the full spectrum of associates ryan i will ask you to ryan t vero president retail sure mike a couple comments i guess you know we have been testing this program now for nearly a year and we ve expanded to the 150 stores we re continuing to refine that model we are seeing some very positive elements of it particularly the customer feedback and the results of average transactions when we are engaging with these customers but it is a continued refinement finding the right model the right operating hours or the right hours for those associates to be in the stores and on the right days and as we get those things honed in we ll be expanding it to a broader base of stores and also developing as jim mentioned into an element of our selling culture that we are trying to essentially inculcate into the entire organization so we re seeing some positive results there as well michael baker deutsche bank analyst okay thanks for the comments james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure mike thanks operator your next question comes from tami zakaria from jp morgan your line is open tami zakaria jp morgan analyst hi thanks for taking my question i have a question regarding your inventory position which has been growing for two quarters in a row now and your days inventory outstanding has jumped quite a bit in 2018 versus 2017 so do you expect that to come down as we look into 2019 james m harrison director and chief executive officer the answer to that question tami is yes the growth of the inventory has really been driven on a consolidated basis has been driven by a number of things right as dan mentioned we acquired approximately 50 franchisee and independent stores that by itself is an addition of more than 25 million of inventory for those acquisitions we also had heavier carryover on halloween than we had in 2017 going to 2018 the irony there is the strong sell through and lower volume in 2017 actually puts us in a position where when we ran into those operational issues in 2018 we didn t have the carryover stock to really make a significant statement for halloween in advance of the normal selling season and so obviously there s a good news bad news with the larger carryover of halloween this year that we will be able to make a stronger statement earlier in the season at the beginning in september but fundamentally as an organization as i said in my earlier comments we re committed to driving our leverage down that means doing a lot of things including sharpening our pencils and taking a tougher look and a harder look at our working capital utilization not just at retail but throughout our entire business we ve got 28 operating businesses three of which are retail and 25 of which are on the consumer product side and each one of those businesses has a general manager and he is a steward of assets and his job as a steward of assets is to sweat and maximize the return on those assets not just the working but also fixed assets and that s really a huge focus for us this year and as dan said our guide is to take the leverage down to just above 4x and that s barring any other potential activities which could generate onetime ph cash flow tami zakaria jp morgan analyst got it thank you and i do have a very follow up question which is have you been seeing any impact from the delay in tax refunds is that did that impact your performance in january or february so far james m harrison director and chief executive officer no tami zakaria jp morgan analyst got it thank you james m harrison director and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from joe feldman from telsey advisory group your line is open joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst hey guys good morning james m harrison director and chief executive officer hey joe joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst one question kind of on the outlook for 2019 how should we think about interest expense going forward because it did come out a little bit above i think what some of us were thinking for the fourth quarter and i know obviously that the impacts you described with floating rates and things like that how should we look at it for next year i ll stop at that daniel j sullivan chief financial officer so joe we ve guided at 115 million to 120 million recall for 2018 we guided at 105 million we came in actually just under that just over that about 106 million so we feel like we ve been pretty transparent with the figures obviously the high yield offering of august and the slightly higher debt levels coming into 2019 will both increase that drive increased interest expense for us and our guide reflects that if you essentially use the guide we put forward on eps there s about a 0 07 to 0 10 headwind in eps associated with the higher interest expense james m harrison director and chief executive officer and remember joe we chose to swap some term out for the high yield at a much higher rate we felt creating some certainty around interest expense and particularly our cost of interest our rate of interest going forward was a proven decision as opposed to being subject to perhaps the volatilities that might occur with the floating rate debt that was in our term debt but once again as we continue to pay debt down we will see that interest expense number come down and the fact that we now have fixed rate debt will make it a lot easier for a much more transparent for anybody here as well as those on the call to be able to gain a perspective and an outlook with respect to where interest is and where it is headed joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst that s helpful thanks and then wanted to go back to i know you guys did a lot of operating improvement within the store the past year to just enhance the overall experience and new operating procedures and all that those things you talked about early in the call what and you referred to it as phase one how should we think about phase two like what is kind of phase two and is that a 2019 event or is it longer term thanks daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes so i would think a couple of things joe for how we think about phase two one is this is not a retail only mindset or approach productivity improvements and efficiency improvements are core to the dna of the business so we have programs in place here in the headquarters we have programs in place in our manufacturing facilities i think retail was just ahead of it and did a very good job developing the program for 2018 which also provides some carryover benefit in 2019 so i would start by saying that it is a way of how we think about running the business and really driving productivity across the enterprise in terms of 2019 sort of specific efforts maybe ryan i ll ask you to just touch on some of the things that the team is working on at retail ryan t vero president retail yes so as dan mentioned we do have some carryover from the prior year but as with any new payroll model that you implement in a store new operating procedures there s continued enhancements that go on and so we have realigned our payroll model throughout last year and actually going into 2019 as well to better align with front facing consumer demand allocating more hours to that activity to help on the selling culture side that i referred to prior as well as continued refinement of the operating back office procedures receiving and put away planogram transitions etcetera that are sort of the boring parts of operating retail stores to many but very very important in terms of our operating excellence in the stores james m harrison director and chief executive officer and joe this is jim i ll just add that on the consumer product side of the business we ve made a number of investments in 2018 which both dan and i referred to in our comments we will harvest some of the benefits of that this year as we continue to work through those investments and finalize the pace of investments most notably in our distribution center we recently put in another pick module which is we refer to as order stock retrievable system which enhances the efficiency of our picking in our rails slow moving items or lower turning items and smaller items but in fact it was threefold which is in response to obviously higher labor rates as well as the continued growth of our business joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst got it that s great thanks guys and good luck with the first quarter james m harrison director and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from curtis nagle from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open curtis nagle bank of america analyst good morning thanks very much so yes i guess to start the first question would be what are you guys targeting for manufacturing share of shelf this year and do you think you re still on track to double over the next four or five years or so daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes we don t actually guide at that level but i will say we do expect to continue to see meaningful growth in manufactured share of shelf we didn t see it in the fourth quarter i think i commented in my opening remarks about essentially there was the headwinds of the product issues getting product out of china and the helium issues but if you normalize for all of that we saw manufactured share of shelf essentially flat in the fourth quarter and up about 30 basis points for the year we think that the growth in 2019 and beyond will be meaningfully more than that as we continue to scale up our recent granmark acquisition and increase the capacity of product coming out of that facility as well as continue to see growth in our balloon category curtis nagle bank of america analyst got it and yes just i guess just going back to the helium issue i mean what gives you the confidence you think this will dissipate i guess by the middle of the year and how much certainty do you have that capacity constraints will be resolved daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes i think it s important as we contemplated the guide we don t think this dissipates at the middle of the year so i want to be clear about how we thought about the guide we do think that there are structural constraints within supply that will last for the year but having said that the impact will be felt for us more in the first half of the year for a couple of reasons one is just the seasonality of the business new year s eve to valentine s day to graduation and secondarily we will begin to cycle the supply constraints that we saw in 2018 in august so our guide contemplates a full year of continued challenge within helium much the way jim described it but it will be felt disproportionately in the first half of the year curtis nagle bank of america analyst all right thanks very much operator your next question is from william reuter from bank of america your line is open mike bank of america analyst hi guys this is mike ph on for bill so my first question is can you talk about the impact if any that you guys are expecting from the second film of disney s frozen and what it will have on the fiscal year or halloween as you saw weak girls james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure so frozen is a fourth quarter event we are not allowed to sell products associated with the new move frozen 2 until october 4th so somewhere around the end of september our stores the back room of our stores will be packed with lots of frozen product and party product the costumes and decor we anticipate it being a good strong property we don t anticipate that it will be quite a phenomenon that it was back in 2014 2015 but we do expect it to be a strong property i believe the first snippet of the trailer had what number was it daniel j sullivan chief financial officer 116 million in a day james m harrison director and chief executive officer 116 million views in one day so that kind of tells you that the market is ready for it but in terms of being a meaningful event for us in q4 as i said earlier when we looked last year at halloween the costume side of the business it was really the juvenile girls side of the business that was really the weakest and so to the extent that frozen will be a strong property we see it potentially filling that void which fundamentally really has a customer that we are accustomed to having making a alternative product selection with respect to the frozen images i look at frozen really as having a bit of a tailwind in q4 and hopefully a better tailwind as we go into 2020 as it continues to gain momentum and they got dvd and all the other forms of streaming media that helps support a property for a longer period of time ryan t vero president retail and there s just one other thing worth noting is the movies official release date is in november and so we ll be obviously marketing off the hype of the movie and the buildup to the launch of the movie there is some limit to the product that you can sell prior to the actual movie launch as well so we ll obviously have all of that product in the stores ready to go in early october for halloween but it will be in advance of the movie s release james m harrison director and chief executive officer right but on the subject of ip there s a lot of good ip this year outside of frozen there s the new descendants which should be very strong for the team and young adult female there s a movie called uglydolls which should do very well for juvenile and then on the marvel side there is ryan t vero president retail avengers james m harrison director and chief executive officer the avengers and then the toy story 4 and then there is aladdin and then there is lion king so it s a pretty pretty robust pipeline from the major studios of ip and then when you couple that with what s going on in the gaming world as well as some of the more tertiary licenses that have a bit of a pop potentially this year we look at ip really being a nice driver particularly in q4 but at the end of the day from a standpoint of frozen it s probably going to be a much more significant 2019 event ryan t vero president retail 2020 james m harrison director and chief executive officer 2020 i apologize thank you ryan mike bank of america analyst thanks and then just lastly should we expect any franchise repurchases in the next fiscal year james m harrison director and chief executive officer as i said in my remarks this year is the year where we re going to focus on the paydown of debt and as a result unless there s an extraordinarily opportunistic opportunity out there we would not anticipate doing any franchisee acquisitions mike bank of america analyst great thanks so much operator thank you there are no further questions at this time this concludes our q a session i will now turn the call back over to our management for closing remarks james m harrison director and chief executive officer thank you very much operator once again everybody thank you for joining us today and once again on

home news haiti aid groups implore christians to pray take action in time of crisis christian aid groups serving in haiti have witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by ongoing demonstrations spurred by allegations of government corruption and the country s inflation crisis haitians again took to the streets in port au prince and other cities this month calling for president jovenel moïse s resignation over allegations the government misappropriated billions of dollars earmarked for reconstruction following a catastrophic 7 1 magnitude earthquake in 2010 that killed an estimated 300 000 people and left between 1 5 million and 2 million homeless during the protests churches were closed schools were shut down including tutoring and other programs provided by christian nonprofit

be the first to know subscribe even though opposition parties have called for demonstrations to continue as they have from time to time since last summer edouard lassegue the regional vice president for compassion international s latin america and caribbean regions told the christian post that the situation has calmed down significantly and businesses churches and schools are opening up again compassion international has been serving in haiti for 50 years and partners with churches to help educate children and provide for their physical and emotional needs more than 109 000 are enrolled in its 315 child development centers in that country individuals who sponsor a child who participates in its program donate 38 a month to go toward that child s education and can opt to donate more funds to provide for other necessities for the child and their family the children that are registered in the compassion program especially those who attend a church in port au prince or other cities that s where most of the demonstrations took place lassegue said those children had to stop attending their activities at the church so for about a week maybe two weeks depending on where they were located those children had to miss the activities going on in the projects as children return to church and their education programs and tutoring it s incumbent upon compassion international s staff who are native to the region to observe them and ensure they receive the emotional support they need part of the response of compassion is not only making sure that those children attend those activities but also pay special attention to the emotional and psychological impacts of the last few weeks lassegue added many times in our countries what we find is that those needs often go unnoticed and even though the child saw or witnessed violence or was the subject of actual violence many times those situations are not addressed compassion is really trying to make sure those children do have that personal attention from a tutor from if the case calls for it a trained counselor who can help children navigate through those feelings and address them he said megan bordeaux the founder of respire haiti a nonprofit that educates 500 children a year and employs 100 locals said she felt called by god to move to the third world country that s plagued by poverty and child slavery after only spending 45 minutes in gressier during a mission trip in 2010 as she watched the children carrying heavy jugs of water on their heads in the hot sun on bellevue mountain s winding path she thought to herself someone needs to come here less than a year later boudreaux left the comforts of her home in america to move to haiti a short distance away from bellevue mountain a site where voodoo or vaudou rituals the afro haitian religion that blends roman catholicism and spirit worship were performed soon after her arrival the then 24 year old now 32 helped expose the corrupt practices at the son of god orphanage and compelled by the heartbreaking and common practice of children being used as restaveks household servants began organizing a nonprofit boudreaux documented those experiences in the book miracle on voodoo mountain a young woman s remarkable story of pushing back the darkness for the children of haiti through feeding programs a school and a medical clinic respire haiti s mission has come to encompass the entire community in gressier but during times of unrest respire haiti christian school and its medical and therapy clinics are closed because it s unsafe for the children and staff to travel from their homes to the school unfortunately respire haiti christian school was closed due to the rioting as well as respire s medical and therapy clinics boudreaux told cp it was unsafe for our 500 plus students and 100 plus staff to try and get to school and work public transportation was not functioning and there were numerous road blocks set up making it impossible for everyone to arrive safely the children we serve get fed twice a day and receive medical care and counseling and the parents are able to use the clinic and other resources as well she said when the school and clinic are closed they aren t able to receive any of these resources last monday respire haiti s clinic and school were reopened to serve food to any students staff and community members that could safely arrive at our school boudreaux said because markets were closed during the riots the cooks who work at the school weren t able to buy the food they needed to make meals so they scrounged together what they could to provide meals for anyone who was able to get to respire haiti christian school she added the market s closure in gressier also posed a challenge for families who were in need of food gas and water unlike in the u s most haitians don t have access to refrigeration to preserve food the children served by respire haiti receive uniforms books computer and library classes and medical care because many of the students have started school at a later age boudreaux said the school has two teachers in each classroom during the day and tutoring available after school as of now the school only offers classes up to the ninth grade due to funding and classroom space despite not being able to educate students past the ninth grade boudreaux said the school has a 100 percent attendance rate among its 560 students we are proud of the way we educate our students she said instead of corporal punishment like most haitian schools we pride ourselves in disciplining in a loving and god honoring way our days begin and end with prayer our teachers love the lord and teach because they love it respire haiti christian school and medical clinic are known in the community as the light on the hill she added poverty inflation disasters and corruption haiti is the poorest country of the america s according to the world bank among its population of 10 4 million 6 million 59 percent live below the national poverty line of 2 41 a day and over 2 5 million fall below the national extreme poverty line of 1 25 a day inflation has been rampant over the last year or two said lassegue last year it s been 15 percent and the haitian gourde has been losing its value at a rate that has been unprecedented all of these situations exert significant pressure on the cost of living and the ability of families to meet the needs of their children and buy food after a two week period like this especially if the parents were day workers and could not work and earn money things were especially difficult because they could not provide for their children there s a lot more hardship for those families that s why we come alongside those families and try to determine the level of need of those children and how we can help lassegue said of compassion s work in the region following the earthquake of 2010 more than 10 4 billion in aid was collected from foreign donors to aid in rebuilding infrastructure and homes that were destroyed but less than 1 percent of the emergency aid spent in their names went directly to haitians according to jake johnston an international research associate at the center for economic and policy research in washington d c and the leading writer for the center s haiti relief and reconstruction watch website the legitimate government the private sector and civil society were cast aside in favor of for profit aid companies in the united states and other foreign experts johnston added in an opinion piece for the new york times raymond joseph former u s ambassador to haiti from 2005 to 2010 noted in an opinion piece for the wall street journal that the center for economic and policy research found that 62 2 percent of contracts from usaid had gone to beltway based firms while just 1 5 percent has gone to haitian companies the cepr also reported that of the 6 43 billion disbursed by bilateral and multilateral donors to haiti from 2010 12 just 9 percent went through the haitian government much of the rest according to cepr was spent lining contractors pockets in july 2015 the u s congress which condemned the lack of accountability for u s funds spent in haiti passed the assessing progress in haiti act that required the secretary of state to provide quarterly reports about u s financed operations in haiti former president bill clinton the u s envoy to haiti and former secretary of state hillary clinton were also criticized by haitians and former government officials because clinton foundation donors and friends of the clintons benefited financially from businesses that were awarded contracts for reconstruction projects in haiti abc news reported in its investigation abc news found that an industrial park and a korean garment factory hailed by hillary clinton as a great success because it was going to create an initial 20 000 jobs and then 65 000 to 100 000 jobs years later has only employed between 4 000 to 9 000 haitians more than 400 farmers were displaced from their land in caracol northeast haiti to make way for that industrial park the korean garment company which was awarded 400 million of global aid subsequently gave 50 000 to 100 000 to the clinton foundation in 2012 and its owner invested in a startup company owned by hillary clinton s former chief of staff the network reported american retailers walmart and gap which donated to the clinton foundation sums of between 1 million to 5 million and 100 000 to 250 000 respectively also benefited from contracts and u s tax breaks as buyers for the clothes shipped from haiti another tragedy struck after the earthquake when 10 000 haitians died from a cholera outbreak spread by infected u n peacekeepers from nepal who were housed at a base that was leaking waste into the meille river the u n didn t apologize or admit its role in the cholera outbreak in haiti where the disease was not present until the u n peacekeepers arrived until 2016 in a u n internal report released in 2016 auditors said a quarter of the sites run by the peacekeepers with the u n s stabilization mission in haiti that they had visited were still discharging their waste into public canals as late as 2014 four years after the epidemic began the ny times reported but the primary reason haitians have been demonstrating in the streets since last summer is to protest government corruption and to find out what happened to missing petrocaribe funds the 4 3 billion in venezuelan oil revenues which haiti had received over the previous decade the money was supposed to fund infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges sanitation and health and hospitals and schools it was also supposed to grow the country s agriculture sector but virtually nothing was accomplished and haitians have been left with unfinished construction projects kot kòb petrocaribe a where s the petrocaribe money thousands of demonstrators chanted in the streets as violent riots broke out petrocaribe was an oil agreement between the late venezuelan president hugo chávez and caribbean nations including haiti in 2006 the haitian government signed an agreement in which they paid venezuela 60 percent of the cost its oil and agreed to pay the remaining balance over 25 years at 1 percent interest the subsidized oil on favorable financing terms was supposed to enable haiti to use the savings to finance social and economic projects the miami herald said in 2017 an anti corruption investigation by the haitian senate commission found that more than a dozen former government officials and heads of private firms embezzled 2 billion in venezuelan oil loans the herald reported it can be declared that the petrocaribe has been the object of embezzlement embezzlement embezzlement and prevarication on the part of those indexed in this report the commission s 650 page report concluded when president jovenel moïse was elected in february 2017 he pledged to crackdown on corruption his political mentor and presidential predecessor michel martelly a recording artist who the obama administration had worked hard to get elected over the incumbent president rené préval presided over most of the petrocaribe spending now mr moïse too has been directly implicated and his government s repression has picked up the ny times reported last summer during the world cup the haitian government announced that it was going to substantially increase fuel prices 38 percent on gas 47 percent on diesel and 51 percent on kerosene which is used by most haitians living in the countryside to light their homes the increase was part of a deal it made with the imf to access 96 million in donor funding plus millions of dollars more in grants and zero interest loans over the next two to three years under another imf program the miami herald reported moïse s administration is not the first to face pressure from the imf over recovering lost revenue on petroleum imports it added soon after the broadcast violent protests broke out and moïse s government suspended the hike despite recent calls for moïse to step down over petrocaribe and the country s inflation crisis he has refused to do so his prime minister jean henry ceant said he has vowed to investigate alleged misspending tied to a venezuelan program that provided haiti with subsidized oil and said he has requested that a court audit all state owned enterprises he also said he would increase the minimum wage and lower the prices of basic goods the associated press reported the recent price of a gallon of gas the ap added is 6 500 gourdes other goods in the western hemisphere s poorest nation have also doubled in price in recent weeks a sack of rice now costs 18 and a can of dry beans around 7 in addition a gallon of cooking oil has gone up to nearly 11 from 7 boudreaux told cp that for respire haiti the gourdes being worth so little has caused a lot of issues for our organization and our ability to purchase what we need to function at an appropriate price gas food school supplies the cost of simple things have gone up and made it hard for us to provide what we usually can with our budget more importantly though inflation has affected the families of our students staff and community she added when prices for staples such as rice beans and eggs become nearly double what they normally cost it becomes extremely difficult for families to provide food fedorah pierre louis public engagement director for the christian nonprofit group world vision international haiti told cp that the repetitive socio economic and political disruptions in the country have created extremely challenging working conditions but staff remain driven to continue their work to help the country s most vulnerable the economic crisis and inflation perpetuates the poverty cycle while the political unrest disrupts all efforts to alleviate poverty said pierre louis although our commitment to improving living conditions of haitians living in the most vulnerable areas remains focused a crisis like the one happening in haiti right now delays our progress and renders the expected impact even more difficult to reach with roadblocks access to vulnerable communities becomes more difficult and field activities and program implementation are delayed she added during times of high fluidity like the february unrest positions held by key government stakeholders are in constant flux that further restricts availability of basic services in the most vulnerable communities as well as offsets policy change advocacy efforts that have been paved world vision s work in haiti is threefold community development emergency relief and public policy the child focused organization works to increase access to clean water basic health care and improving hygiene nutrition and sanitation practices it also provides supplies to victims of chronic or rapid onset disasters and crises and it works with policymakers and the public at the national regional and local levels to build awareness around the root causes of poverty and to address the unjust systems that help perpetuate it pierre louis said travel to haiti and evacuations a group of canadian missionaries made international headlines this month after they were safely evacuated out of haiti during the protests and riots the church group which was working with haiti arise had been unable to leave their compound due to roads being blocked or damaged they paid 6 900 to be transported by helicopter to the airport for a flight to miami florida mission aviation fellowship a christian ministry organization that maintains a permanent base in port au prince with four airplanes evacuated 136 stranded missionaries aid workers and others from outlying areas to the airport in port au prince this month while also providing medical and other flight services family members of mission aviation fellowship pilots and mechanics were also evacuated during the violent protests and are now returning to their homes in haiti the nine family members were evacuated february 14 as violence in the country escalated maf said in a statement shared with cp last friday we became concerned as the violence continued and as a precaution we had our maf expat staff families evacuate the country said david holsten president of mission aviation fellowship our partners in mission work have also been evacuating their people as local travel had become too precarious while we believe it is safe for family members to return we will continue to keep a close watch on the situation in haiti since compassion international hires national staff they did not have to evacuate any employees during the protests and riots but they did temporarily suspend all trips for child sponsor visits because of the volatility of the situation and those trips have not yet been resumed lassegue said similarly world vision haiti s international staff remained in the country but its crisis management team decided to evacuate the children of its international employees pierre louis told cp of its established security and evacuation procedures on feb 6 a day before the beginning of the unrest world vision international haiti s staff was dismissed pierre louis said to ensure that they would have enough time to stock up on supplies and reach home safely that same evening we activated our crisis management team meeting virtually to monitor the situation analyzing external events activating our contingency plan and our internal phone tree and warden system to ensure that our staff the children in the communities and beneficiaries of our programs were all safe and sound she added from feb 7 until feb 18 staff were advised to shelter in place which meant that all field activities were suspended and many of its offices were closed except in areas where no riots were reported such as la gonave on feb 19 world vision partially resumed its field operations prayer and next steps the images of rioters burning tires is not what boudreaux wants people to visualize when they think of haiti what isn t seen she said is the country s beauty and the resilience of its people when rioting and protests occur in haiti it s so often the images of tires burning and people yelling and waving guns that make the news she lamented unfortunately the parts of haiti that aren t shown are the police sweeping up the streets the joyful faces of the women who were able to sell in the market today and the prayer that people have been covering the country in please pray for the people of haiti boudreaux added please pray for the leadership of respire haiti to continue to serve love and educate the students there are still 100 students in respire haiti s education program that are in need of a sponsor to continue in the program she added compassion international s child sponsors received an update last thursday about the anti government protests around the country and were told that if their sponsored child was affected they would be notified as soon as possible schools child development centers and compassion international s office in port au prince that were temporarily closed due to the riots and lack of public safety are now reopened lassegue has called on christians worldwide to ask the lord to guide staff ask for protection for the children and ask the lord to provide wisdom and encourage the leaders and tutors who are standing in the gap to minister to those children for those who already sponsor a child lassegue said if they are so inclined they could provide a monetary family gift donation that would go a long way especially if the father could not work or the mother had to stay home and could not earn at their day jobs he said another way that could be of help is what we call a project gift it would help organize a day camp or camp activities for children he added especially after they ve faced times of hardship it s good for children to come to a place where they can be ministered to and where they can be followed up on advised and taught and counseled these actually help those children bounce back as they share their experience and receive some practical biblical teaching to help them face the reality that they faced just recently

after which we will open up the call for your questions as you saw from this morning s earnings press release top line results for the fourth quarter was slightly below expectations in large part due to continued helium supply pressures that unexpectedly persisted from november and to a lesser degree into december gross margins were in line with expectations and ebitda and eps were at the low end of our expected ranges as we exercised disciplined cost control for the full year consolidated revenues grew 2 4 gross margins declined 20 bps with ebitda and eps totaling 400 million and 1 61 respectively we generated strong cash flow of 315 million for the year which allowed us to complete significant franchisee acquisitions while also investing in the businesses and opportunistically repurchasing shares looking back at 2018 it was an important foundational year for the business in which we made meaningful progress against several growth strategies that will strengthen the businesses in 2019 and beyond starting with the retail business sales grew 4 3 for the year reflecting the further execution of our omnichannel strategy we continued focusing on improved consumer shopping experiences across both brick and mortar as well as online this focus included completing phase one of retail productivity initiatives within the party city stores thereby improving the operational performance of the stores simplifying store operating procedures improving the flow of product and optimizing labor the sales associated with these initiatives have served as a catalyst for reinvestment into the party planner program as to level enhancing our level of customer service and customer experience at the end of the year the party planner program was in 150 stores and the positive results clearly demonstrate the opportunity for us to grow the basket to create a customer engagement and higher quality of service in 2018 we also strengthened our seasonal product offerings with a wide variety of refresh assortments at halloween city we supported a better curated inaudible for the temporary store consumer with the larger offering of animatronics thereby creating greater in store theater additionally we expanded the assortment in certain stores to include a selected toy offering these changes helped drive meaningful comp sales in our temporary stores touching for a moment on the toy pilot the results were mixed the performance of the 50 toy city temporary stores did not meet our early on expectations however we are very encouraged by the results seen in the permanent stores where we piloted ph a number of tests for the toy category including expanded in aisle presence and front end in and out programs while we are still evaluating the full opportunity for this category there is little doubt that toys can play a role in strengthening our overall offering we also made meaningful improvements to our e commerce business in fiscal 2018 we completed and launched the broader site replatforming that included improved product creative and site content this replatforming has resulted in better usability easier check outflow and a more faster browsing experience for consumers especially when using their mobile devices we also leveraged this technology to support the consumers desire to seamlessly shop the category through the expansion of our buy online pick up in store program as well as improved product availability checks online in october we announced the expansion of our digital initiatives with the creation of a party city branded storefront on amazon marketplace this move has allowed us to further expand the reach of our brands and unique product offerings while complementing the partycity com website within the amazon storefront we initially focused on a curated offering for halloween and then broadly assortments to include christmas and new year s products and recently we have broadened the offering to include a selected everyday product offering as well largely this offering is in the form of coordinated kits as we leverage our position as the leading manufacturer supplier and retailer of consumer party goods these e commerce improvements have been well received by consumers reflected by improved traffic to our sites increased conversion rates and accelerated growth rates when including the impact of bopis e commerce comps for the fourth quarter and full year were 33 and 18 respectively turning for a moment to the consumer products businesses while the earlier shortages in supply chain disruptions in the second half of 2018 affected our consolidated top line performance the total consumer products business on a pro forma basis increased about 1 the north american consumer products business gained significant new customers in both the grocery and mass channels which helped partially offset continued sluggish franchise and independent party specialty retail performance the north american consumer products business was also successful in continuing to increase distribution into non traditional party channels or alternative channels including movie theaters zoos sporting and entertainment venues the results we ve seen from increased focus on leveraging of our personalized products capabilities as well as newer channels has been very encouraging internationally the consumers products businesses have deepened the relationship with key retailers in australia europe the u k and mexico education and curation assortments are creating inroads in many new markets we continue to see an opportunity for us to increase our overall global presence the kazzam marketplace pilot remains as part of our broader future digital strategy in the fourth quarter we achieved the goal of going live in about 15 markets at the end of the year our inaudible is that the broad proof of concept has been met and we are aggressively moving to second stage of this pilot focused on customer acquisition plans for 2019 include utilizing the full suite of party city assets to build awareness drive traffic and exploit the intersection of our marketplace and retail businesses we are now deploying at about 15 of our stores a combination of in store initiatives as well as digital efforts and limited above the line marketing to drive consumer awareness and help scale the business based upon the results we anticipate further market rollout later this year and i look forward to sharing the results as kazzam comes to life and becomes a reality in addition to kazzam in 2018 we invested heavily to improve and expand our crm capabilities these efforts have and will continue to allow us to gain a deeper understanding of our consumer and create more targeted marketing campaigns delivering a more personalized experience for our consumers we ended 2018 with a customer database of over 25 million identifiable customers representing 40 years of purchase data it is this growing database that we will leverage to create more personalized experiences for our customers we continue to optimize the effectiveness and the mix of our marketing spend working dollars increased 3 year over year despite spending remaining essentially flat these efforts include diversifying away from traditional media venues and increasing our digital spend and promotional advertising which increased 25 year over year in 2018 with unaided brand awareness over 70 the marketing dollars we deploy must be done so in conjunction with our enhanced crm targeting capabilities and really focus on driving uniqueness for the customer like all retailers we have been faced with heightened inflationary pressures in 2018 however our bottom line results for the year demonstrate the clear benefits of our differentiated vertical model the self manufactured share of shelf expanded by 30 points in 2018 and productivity improvement initiatives helped partially mitigate these inflationary pressures limiting gross margin decline to 20 bps for the year dan will discuss this in more detail shortly the vertical model also provided the business an opportunity to mitigate the potential impact of the tariff policy on the business if the 25 tariffs were to go into effect at some future point in time we have largely addressed and essentially mitigated the potential 12 million annual run rate headwind this has been accomplished in large part through a combination of product reengineering accelerated resourcing efforts and increasing the self manufactured share generally in our factories in north america i am extremely proud how our consumer products teams have moved quickly and effectively to leverage our best in class capabilities to meet this significant operational challenge timely and highly accretive retail acquisitions were a core component of our growth strategy in 2018 and we completed the acquisition of 58 franchise and independent stores across maryland pennsylvania minnesota north dakota and texas in 2018 as we said before these acquisitions further expand our corporate footprint at very attractive cash and cash multiples and 2018 provided a unique moment for us to accelerate these acquisition efforts going forward we expect the pace of retail store acquisitions to significantly decrease and we will prioritize debt pay down as we focus on our leverage ratio goal of between 3x and 3 5x by the end of 2020 so in summary 2018 top line results were slightly below expectations due in part to the temporary headwinds but through a control of costs and by leveraging the vertical we delivered bottom line results at the low end of our guided range we made meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives to strengthen the business and we are well positioned in 2019 as the calendar turns favorable with halloween moving to a thursday and with what we believe to be a very strong license portfolio in the year ahead the 2019 strategic objectives for the businesses are clear one drive meaningful organic growth two expand the vertical as we produce source and distribute more efficiently and improve the overall operational performance of the business and finally most importantly strengthen the balance sheet for long term success of the business critical investments in support of our top line objectives have been made and the business is poised for sustainable comp sales growth process adjustments have been instituted to improve operational efficiencies and the capital investments in manufacturing distribution made in 2018 are set to yield the anticipated benefits but once again rest assured we remain firmly committed to accelerating our pay down debt all of which supports our focus on creating long lasting shareholder value before i close i d like to acknowledge the announcement made today that dan sullivan has decided to pursue another opportunity elsewhere and will be leaving the company on march 22nd i would thank dan for his commitment and dedication to pchi over the past 2 5 years he has built a strong and a capable finance organization and helped drive our retail productivity initiatives we wish dan all the best in his future endeavors as a result of dan s departure we have also announced that michael correale our chief accounting officer who served as our cfo for 14 years from 2002 to 2016 has accepted the position of interim cfo allowing for a seamless transition until a permanent replacement for dan is identified mike s knowledge of the business and experience will provide a steady set of hands and now i d like to turn the call over to dan to discuss the fourth quarter and full year results and the 2019 outlook in greater detail daniel j sullivan chief financial officer thanks jim it has been a wonderful 2 5 years at party city and i m privileged to serve the company and our shareholders i am extremely proud of the tremendously talented finance organization that has been built and i m confident that the organization is well positioned for continued success now turning to the results as you heard jim mention 2018 was an important foundational year as we made critical investments across the business to enhance our position as a world class vertically integrated retailer there were a few unexpected transitory issues which we ve discussed and which i ll elaborate on in a moment that transpired in the back half of the year that negatively impacted the top line and pressured gross margins at both retail and wholesale that said even with these operational headwinds we still reported eps and ebitda within our updated guided range for the year for fiscal 2018 revenues increased 2 2 on a constant currency basis gross margin rate declined 20 basis points as expected adjusted ebitda declined 2 and adjusted eps increased to 1 61 from 1 24 inclusive of share repurchases and the benefit from tax reform as well as the headwind associated with higher interest expense and we once again generated strong free cash flow of 315 million our fourth quarter top line results were impacted by persisting helium pressures that at times were a significant headwind for both our balloon business and juvenile birthday business negatively impacting both our retail comps as well as well as our consumer products sales despite sluggish revenues in the quarter in part also impacted by the new year s eve shift the year over year decline in gross margin was in line with expectations and eps came in toward the middle of the range driven by solid cost control looking more closely at fourth quarter results consolidated revenue grew 2 on a reported basis or 2 5 when adjusted for currency in our retail segment sales increased 4 5 in constant currency largely a result of the acquisition of franchise and independent stores over the last 12 months as we added about 8 in retail square footage in 2018 almost entirely through acquisitions at quarter s end our store network totaled 962 stores 866 of which were corporate stores our brand comparable sales which include our u s and canadian permanent stores and north american e commerce business declined 2 9 this reflects an approximate 150 basis point impact from the helium shortage that persisted from q3 in addition as we expected the headwind of the new year s eve shift was about 110 basis points implying an underlying comp for the quarter absent of these two factors of down slightly underlying comp sales performance strengthened as the quarter progressed and seasonal comps in december were positive despite the new year s eve shift with the christmas season up over 20 as customers responded well to our new christmas and hanukkah designs and updated assortments our web business remained a bright spot in the quarter increasing 12 in q4 or 33 when adjusted for bopis turning to the non vertical consumer products businesses net revenue increased 30 basis points in q4 after adjusting for the impact of franchise and independent acquisitions and foreign exchange as we cycled last year s 4q constant currency organic growth of 12 international consumer products declined approximately 1 8 in constant currency despite mid single digit growth in our core commercial markets this decline was partially due to continued sluggish results in our direct from plant fob business combined with the tough comparison to prior year period when we saw 20 international growth importantly we continue to strengthen relationships with key retail partners in our core international markets and have leveraged our strong positioning in the foil balloon category which drove continued growth in australia europe and mexico on a two year basis we have seen quarterly growth of about 18 the domestic consumer products business continues to be challenged due to soft franchise and independent performance and declined 1 1 adjusted for acquisitions as we cycled 10 growth from last year in q4 the declines were largely a result of the american greetings decision to exit the category a sluggish wednesday halloween and declines in the gift business importantly the alternative markets channel increased about 5 on a run rate basis in the quarter and reflects key wins in mass and grocery most notably with target michaels and krogers as expected our consolidated gross profit margin was 45 3 or 160 basis points below the same quarter last year and in line with our expectations almost 100 basis points of the decline was attributable to the operational headwinds that we previously discussed on our q3 call this was related to supply chain disruptions associated with the surge in demand for moving product out of china ahead of tariff implementation resulting in incremental freight distribution and labor costs that were largely realized in q4 additionally we continued to experience increased inflationary pressures associated with freight and distribution costs and saw some negative impact as a result of higher helium costs in terms of both sourcing and negative product mix finally as we previewed in our 3q call we shifted promotional spend from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in support of our holiday execution all of these headwinds were partially mitigated by the continued execution of our retail productivity initiatives overall share of shelf decreased 160 basis points primarily due to the negative impact on halloween from q3 s operational issues getting product out of china manufacturing share of shelf also decreased 160 basis points to 16 6 also driven largely by the negative helium shortage impact on balloon sales normalizing for the helium issue the operational challenges already discussed and the new year s eve shift manufacturing share of shelf was just over 18 and flat to last year s q4 operating expenses as a percent of revenue leveraged 20 basis points year over year largely reflecting the continued labor productivity efforts at retail and the reduction in management incentive costs in our retail business we saw labor rates improved by 40 basis points fueled by 70 basis points of benefit from the scaling of our productivity initiatives and we ve already begun piloting the next phase of our work for 2019 we are redeploying the savings from our productivity initiatives into the party planner program which we now have in about 150 stores with about 70 stores having been launched late in 3q overall we re continuing to see about a 1 to 2 comp lift versus the rest of chain with stronger results in the more mature stores we continue to improve this program by strengthening the labor model enhancing our training program reducing associate turnover and continuing to modify the underlying incentive schemes to drive performance we are seeing the benefits of these improvements in our customer satisfaction and net promoter scores which continue to strengthen with the holidays now behind us we ll further evaluate and scale the program over the course of 2019 reported income from operations was 158 8 million or 19 7 of net revenue compared to 167 4 million or 21 2 of net revenue in the prior year period with the decrease due to lower gross margins interest expense for the fourth quarter was 29 2 million or 7 million above the same quarter last year with the increase equally attributable to increased borrowings under our abl facility the impact of increasing libor rates on both our term loan and abl facility and the high yield offering that was successfully executed in august in the quarter our reported effective tax rate was impacted by a non recurring adjustment related to tax reform our adjusted effective tax rate was 25 4 adjusted net income of 103 4 million increased 9 9 compared to last year s fourth quarter and adjusted eps increased to 1 08 per share from 0 81 per share the 2018 results are inclusive of tailwinds from tax reform and a reduction in our share count through our share buyback activity partially offset by higher interest expense year over year adjusted ebitda decreased about 4 versus the fourth quarter of last year to 188 9 million turning to our full year results consolidated revenue was 2 43 billion which represented growth of over 2 on both a reported and constant currency basis retail operations posted a 4 3 increase on both a reported basis and in constant currency driven largely by increased store count during the year we acquired 58 franchise and independent stores and opened five net new stores reported comps declined 70 basis points for the year while on an adjusted basis excluding the unique headwinds of helium shortages the operational issues getting product out of china as well as the tailwinds of lapping hurricanes and the seo issues over a year ago underlying comps were essentially flat our e commerce comp sales increased 18 when including bopis sales our non vertical consumer products revenue increased 0 3 after adjusting for the impact of franchise acquisitions and foreign exchange largely reflective of american greetings decision to exit the category and the continued deterioration of the independent and franchise business in part a reflection of a wednesday halloween the alternative markets business grew 9 on a run rate basis for the year and we are encouraged by the growth seen not only in mass and grocery but also on the promotional and experiential channels which we will continue to focus on in 2019 our international consumer products business grew 1 7 for the year on a constant currency basis driven by almost 9 constant currency growth in our core markets of australia europe the u k canada and mexico we continue to exploit our full product assortment with growth being driven by innovative merchandising product development and category management with key retailers gross margin rate declined 20 basis points for the year despite continued productivity gains at retail the margin declines were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs and higher costs from the q3 operational issues related to getting product out of china negative product mix and commodity and labor inflationary pressures were additional though less meaningful headwinds we increased manufactured share of shelf 30 basis points to 22 9 and estimate this increase to be 100 basis points year over year when adjusting for the negative effects of the items discussed earlier operating expenses were 713 9 million which were higher by about 17 7 million or flat as a percentage of revenue versus 2017 primarily due to the improved labor productivity management better expense management and lower incentive costs at retail we realized a 60 basis point improvement in direct labor rates largely as a result of the maturation of our first phase of labor productivity initiatives interest expense was 105 7 million compared to 87 4 million last year with the increase attributable to the increased borrowings under the abl the impact of increasing libor rates on both our term and abl and to a lesser degree the recent high yield offering that was successfully executed in august our reported effective tax rate reflects a non recurring adjustment related to tax reform and for the full year this rate was 25 adjusted net income was 156 8 million or 5 5 above last year resulting in adjusted eps growth to 1 61 per share versus 1 24 per share in the prior year period the 2018 results are inclusive of tailwinds from tax reform a reduction in our share count due to our buyback activity and partially offset by higher interest expense and kazzam investments year over year adjusted ebitda for the year was 400 1 million versus 409 2 million in the prior year finally for the year we delivered free cash flow defined as adjusted ebitda less capex of 314 million a decrease of 28 million or 8 versus 2017 primarily due to increased capex of 19 million in support of our web replatforming and productivity efforts at retail and in our main distribution center cash flows from operations was a source of 102 million including a working capital use of 125 million which was largely a reflection of increased inventory levels in part due to softer than expected halloween sales capex totaled 86 million while we allocated 40 million toward stock repurchases and 65 million toward acquisitions we ended the year with net debt of about 1 9 billion resulting in a debt leverage ratio of 4 7x with about 1 10th of a turn as a result of our share repurchase program at the end of the quarter we had approximately 210 million available in our existing asset base revolver before i discuss our 2019 guidance i wanted to note a few items impacting our outlook as jim said there were a few tailwinds in 2019 including the shift to a thursday halloween and a more favorable licensed property calendar which is most relevant for our juvenile party and costume businesses our comps guidance for the year contemplates further helium supply constraints anticipated to be at current levels and which are likely to disproportionately impact half one due to business seasonality and the fact that we will cycle 2018 supply issues which began in august of last year further our quarterly comps outlook reflects calendar favorability in q1 due to new year s eve shift and is partially offset by the negative impact of easter shifting into q2 overall we expect half one comps to be flat to slightly negative we expect the benefit from supply chain investments we made ahead of and following the disruptions that impacted the business in 2018 while inflationary pressures are expected to persist most notably related to freight and helium we anticipate gaap operating income margin to be slightly positive when compared to 2018 rates largely reflective of slightly positive gross margin rates we expect interest expense to be in the range of 115 million to 120 million for the year with that said for fiscal 2019 we expect revenue to be in the range of 2 488 billion to 2 538 billion and comp sales to be up about 1 we project full year adjusted net income to be in the range of 152 million to 162 million or 1 61 to 1 72 per share we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 405 million to 418 million in terms of capital allocation priorities we expect to spend about 2 8 of net revenue on capex which is down from approximately 3 5 in 2018 and we anticipate ending the year with a net debt leverage ratio of 4 1x for all other detail around our outlook please refer to our press release and with that i d like to turn the call back over to the operator to open up the call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from matt mcclintock from barclays your line is open matthew mcclintock barclays analyst hi yes good morning everyone and best of luck dan daniel j sullivan chief financial officer thanks matt matthew mcclintock barclays analyst two questions the first one is just helium could you just give us your broader perspective on the helium shortage there s been a lot of news over the course of last month that the helium shortage is getting is intensifying and can you just talk about how your sources of helium are i guess locked in or provide you with some type of view that you will be able to get that product thanks james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure matt so i think as you recall in our third quarter call we called out helium and it was our expectation and it was the expectation of those who were experts that the situation would stabilize and begin to resolve itself obviously it continues to persist and as dan mentioned in our comps we ve projected a continuance of the helium situation at its current levels as we look at the full year from a percentage standpoint currently we re operating at about 60 to 70 of our average allocation for helium and that bounces around quite a bit based upon the time of the month and just general availability we ve done a number of things to the source helium from additional resources outside of our standard contract relationship and as a result of that we ve been able to bring the average up to about 70 as we look at typically what we need to really satisfy our demand vis a vis our allocation of our contract we need about 80 to 85 so there s about a 14 give or take through headwind and the availability to us of helium on a day in and day out basis but like i said over the course of a month or a week it can vary from anywhere from 50 stores having helium issues to over 200 stores having helium issues as we look for the longer term as those of you know and have heard me talk about helium in the past there s plenty of helium in terms of known reserves the constraint really today is really supply chain and refining capacity it s very well documented in a number of articles where that refining capacity is being built and the causes for the shortage in the refining capacity being primarily the influence of the government s decision to continue to reduce helium out of the blm years ago and calamities that inhibited investment in refining capacity so as we look at the full year we expect helium to continue to be a headwind we believe our comp guidance incorporates enough of a quantification of that headwind that we still conservatively believe that we can be in the range of flat to slight 1 comp hopefully that s helpful matthew mcclintock barclays analyst extremely helpful jim thank you very much and just i guess as a clarification question on the comp guidance one for the full year i believe that s similar to your comp guidance as you entered last year or 2018 and so i guess my question is does the helium headwind offset the benefit of a more optimal timing of halloween and that s what you have the similar guidance as you began last year thanks james m harrison director and chief executive officer i think fundamentally that s probably a very down and dirty quick analysis of the situation obviously there s a great number of puts and takes within our guidance and within our projected probably comp for the year obviously the operational issues that we highlighted in our third quarter call we ve taken tremendous strides and steps to make sure that we are ahead of that curve we don t anticipate that sort of drag on comps in 2019 and there are like i said there are a number of puts and takes but the easiest way of thinking about it is yes we moved to a strong calendar on halloween we moved to strong properties and the helium mitigates the full impact of what that normalization normally would have provided us matthew mcclintock barclays analyst thank you very much for the color operator your next question comes from simeon gutman from morgan stanley your line is open simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys my question is on ebitda guidance for the growth that s embedded in the guidance year over year so we know you re lapping investment from 2018 you mentioned some non recurring consulting costs i don t know if you quantified some operational headwinds and now and we know helium even though it sounds like it will linger a little bit in the first half and then jim you just mentioned the better licensed product and i would guess halloween should be no worse than a push relative to this year so looks like the ebitda growth that s implied it s muted for conservatism or there s just a lot of cost that s still holding on in the business daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes simeon it s dan i would maybe highlight two things one is our outlook on gross margin and we should not ignore the helium impact on gross margin what we ve said is we expect gross margins to be flat to slightly positive versus a year ago helium will represent about a 30 basis point headwind to margins in the year equally sort of balanced between higher cost to secure helium and the negative effect on mix that s selling less balloon have so you have to start with our gross margin outlook i think the other piece that i would call out is the ti impact year over year we continue to have less and less ti addbacks to our ebitda which we are cycling about 5 million less in addbacks in 2019 than we were in 2018 which makes the flow through of ebitda look a little bit skewed but doesn t actually change sort of how we think about the year simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst okay and then just related to balloons and helium can you tell us when you if you when you make money on a balloon are you making money marking up the balloon and the helium or is it just one side of it and have you considered raising prices on balloons james m harrison director and chief executive officer to answer that question the answer to the question is not only have we considered it we ve actually done it to mitigate some of the headwind on the helium we don t really mark up the helium per se the helium is part it s similar to the labor to fill the balloon and make the put the ribbon on the balloon that s all incorporated within the cost of executing the sale of a inflated balloon but we have looked at pricing on our balloons to adjust for the increased cost of the helium but with increased prices obviously there is a put and a take that occurs at retail in terms of the consumers perceptions to how many balloons they re going to buy and just following up on your earlier question a little bit about the calendar shift and the impact of the store licensing it s interesting to note that as we mentioned in our third quarter call the proportion of our business that we saw really most affected by this most recent halloween was not necessarily the adult business which you generally expect to be substantially affected by the midweek halloween but actually the girls business due to the absence of strong properties so as we think about this shift to thursday and the impact of that really that coupled with the girls shift is really what s going to drive the halloween business as opposed to what one normally would have expected to be a larger portion of the assortment being purchased by the adult category so while there s two benefits there they basically merge into one simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst got it okay thanks jim dan good luck daniel j sullivan chief financial officer thanks simeon appreciate it operator your next question comes from mike baker from deutsche bank your line is open michael baker deutsche bank analyst hi thanks just to touch on these issues again and i guess throughout the year you ve given us an update or at least some data we could probably try to back into it but i ll just ask your view on that can you order all the issues that have happened in 2018 which impacted you the most in terms of halloween the helium poor licensing the tough china issues even freight costs i mean there are like five or six things what was the most impactful in your mind daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes mike so it s dan i think you have to separate it between are you talking topline impact or gross margin impact right certainly from a topline standpoint comps in particular we would obviously say the issue is getting product out of china and therefore affecting our halloween business would be first and foremost on the list and then secondarily helium while it had an impact in q4 which we ve estimated to be 150 basis points of comps headwind on a full year basis obviously far less than that if you talk about gross margins and full year rate the freight and distribution costs would be first on the list because that s a a structural issue that has been with us for the entire year and drove about 35 to 40 basis points of headwind against margins again from a timing point of view the issues getting product out of china was limited to the fourth quarter it had a meaningful impact on the quarter we ve said about 100 basis points year over year but far less on a full year so hopefully that answers your question michael baker deutsche bank analyst yes it does and following up the freight and distribution costs of 35 to 40 ph is that including the china issue or is that separate just higher freight rates and the like daniel j sullivan chief financial officer no it s a separate michael baker deutsche bank analyst understood and do we expect that to dissipate at all in 2019 some spot rate and contact rates have already come down a little bit or are you planning for that same type of a tailwind or headwind i should say in 2019 james m harrison director and chief executive officer we are anticipating it to be a continuing headwind to the magnitude that it was this past year we are not expecting a real loosening on freight at anytime soon there have been a number of bankruptcies of freight carriers recently in this quarter even so we don t anticipate freight loosening up substantially michael baker deutsche bank analyst okay understood if i could ask one more maybe more of a positive question the party planner initiative seems like it s gone pretty well it s in 150 stores you have sort of been reluctant to talk about the pace of the roll out but any color on how many more stores we expect to see that in 2019 eventually this can this be in all stores and is there enough efficiencies to offset those costs still to go james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure i ll start and i ll ask ryan vero our president of pricing and retail to chime in essentially in terms of rolling it out to all stores that would not make sense what we are doing is we are look at ways of utilizing technology at various levels at store level and also broadening the training of our associates so that we don t have a bifurcated group who is simply focused on customer engagement really our goal and ryan can certainly enhance this conversation is to really create a service orientation throughout our retail organization so that we are less dependent on a single party planner to be the face of the customer engagement initiative but rather broaden the customer engagement initiative across the full spectrum of associates ryan i will ask you to ryan t vero president retail sure mike a couple comments i guess you know we have been testing this program now for nearly a year and we ve expanded to the 150 stores we re continuing to refine that model we are seeing some very positive elements of it particularly the customer feedback and the results of average transactions when we are engaging with these customers but it is a continued refinement finding the right model the right operating hours or the right hours for those associates to be in the stores and on the right days and as we get those things honed in we ll be expanding it to a broader base of stores and also developing as jim mentioned into an element of our selling culture that we are trying to essentially inculcate into the entire organization so we re seeing some positive results there as well michael baker deutsche bank analyst okay thanks for the comments james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure mike thanks operator your next question comes from tami zakaria from jp morgan your line is open tami zakaria jp morgan analyst hi thanks for taking my question i have a question regarding your inventory position which has been growing for two quarters in a row now and your days inventory outstanding has jumped quite a bit in 2018 versus 2017 so do you expect that to come down as we look into 2019 james m harrison director and chief executive officer the answer to that question tami is yes the growth of the inventory has really been driven on a consolidated basis has been driven by a number of things right as dan mentioned we acquired approximately 50 franchisee and independent stores that by itself is an addition of more than 25 million of inventory for those acquisitions we also had heavier carryover on halloween than we had in 2017 going to 2018 the irony there is the strong sell through and lower volume in 2017 actually puts us in a position where when we ran into those operational issues in 2018 we didn t have the carryover stock to really make a significant statement for halloween in advance of the normal selling season and so obviously there s a good news bad news with the larger carryover of halloween this year that we will be able to make a stronger statement earlier in the season at the beginning in september but fundamentally as an organization as i said in my earlier comments we re committed to driving our leverage down that means doing a lot of things including sharpening our pencils and taking a tougher look and a harder look at our working capital utilization not just at retail but throughout our entire business we ve got 28 operating businesses three of which are retail and 25 of which are on the consumer product side and each one of those businesses has a general manager and he is a steward of assets and his job as a steward of assets is to sweat and maximize the return on those assets not just the working but also fixed assets and that s really a huge focus for us this year and as dan said our guide is to take the leverage down to just above 4x and that s barring any other potential activities which could generate onetime ph cash flow tami zakaria jp morgan analyst got it thank you and i do have a very follow up question which is have you been seeing any impact from the delay in tax refunds is that did that impact your performance in january or february so far james m harrison director and chief executive officer no tami zakaria jp morgan analyst got it thank you james m harrison director and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from joe feldman from telsey advisory group your line is open joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst hey guys good morning james m harrison director and chief executive officer hey joe joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst one question kind of on the outlook for 2019 how should we think about interest expense going forward because it did come out a little bit above i think what some of us were thinking for the fourth quarter and i know obviously that the impacts you described with floating rates and things like that how should we look at it for next year i ll stop at that daniel j sullivan chief financial officer so joe we ve guided at 115 million to 120 million recall for 2018 we guided at 105 million we came in actually just under that just over that about 106 million so we feel like we ve been pretty transparent with the figures obviously the high yield offering of august and the slightly higher debt levels coming into 2019 will both increase that drive increased interest expense for us and our guide reflects that if you essentially use the guide we put forward on eps there s about a 0 07 to 0 10 headwind in eps associated with the higher interest expense james m harrison director and chief executive officer and remember joe we chose to swap some term out for the high yield at a much higher rate we felt creating some certainty around interest expense and particularly our cost of interest our rate of interest going forward was a proven decision as opposed to being subject to perhaps the volatilities that might occur with the floating rate debt that was in our term debt but once again as we continue to pay debt down we will see that interest expense number come down and the fact that we now have fixed rate debt will make it a lot easier for a much more transparent for anybody here as well as those on the call to be able to gain a perspective and an outlook with respect to where interest is and where it is headed joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst that s helpful thanks and then wanted to go back to i know you guys did a lot of operating improvement within the store the past year to just enhance the overall experience and new operating procedures and all that those things you talked about early in the call what and you referred to it as phase one how should we think about phase two like what is kind of phase two and is that a 2019 event or is it longer term thanks daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes so i would think a couple of things joe for how we think about phase two one is this is not a retail only mindset or approach productivity improvements and efficiency improvements are core to the dna of the business so we have programs in place here in the headquarters we have programs in place in our manufacturing facilities i think retail was just ahead of it and did a very good job developing the program for 2018 which also provides some carryover benefit in 2019 so i would start by saying that it is a way of how we think about running the business and really driving productivity across the enterprise in terms of 2019 sort of specific efforts maybe ryan i ll ask you to just touch on some of the things that the team is working on at retail ryan t vero president retail yes so as dan mentioned we do have some carryover from the prior year but as with any new payroll model that you implement in a store new operating procedures there s continued enhancements that go on and so we have realigned our payroll model throughout last year and actually going into 2019 as well to better align with front facing consumer demand allocating more hours to that activity to help on the selling culture side that i referred to prior as well as continued refinement of the operating back office procedures receiving and put away planogram transitions etcetera that are sort of the boring parts of operating retail stores to many but very very important in terms of our operating excellence in the stores james m harrison director and chief executive officer and joe this is jim i ll just add that on the consumer product side of the business we ve made a number of investments in 2018 which both dan and i referred to in our comments we will harvest some of the benefits of that this year as we continue to work through those investments and finalize the pace of investments most notably in our distribution center we recently put in another pick module which is we refer to as order stock retrievable system which enhances the efficiency of our picking in our rails slow moving items or lower turning items and smaller items but in fact it was threefold which is in response to obviously higher labor rates as well as the continued growth of our business joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst got it that s great thanks guys and good luck with the first quarter james m harrison director and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from curtis nagle from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open curtis nagle bank of america analyst good morning thanks very much so yes i guess to start the first question would be what are you guys targeting for manufacturing share of shelf this year and do you think you re still on track to double over the next four or five years or so daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes we don t actually guide at that level but i will say we do expect to continue to see meaningful growth in manufactured share of shelf we didn t see it in the fourth quarter i think i commented in my opening remarks about essentially there was the headwinds of the product issues getting product out of china and the helium issues but if you normalize for all of that we saw manufactured share of shelf essentially flat in the fourth quarter and up about 30 basis points for the year we think that the growth in 2019 and beyond will be meaningfully more than that as we continue to scale up our recent granmark acquisition and increase the capacity of product coming out of that facility as well as continue to see growth in our balloon category curtis nagle bank of america analyst got it and yes just i guess just going back to the helium issue i mean what gives you the confidence you think this will dissipate i guess by the middle of the year and how much certainty do you have that capacity constraints will be resolved daniel j sullivan chief financial officer yes i think it s important as we contemplated the guide we don t think this dissipates at the middle of the year so i want to be clear about how we thought about the guide we do think that there are structural constraints within supply that will last for the year but having said that the impact will be felt for us more in the first half of the year for a couple of reasons one is just the seasonality of the business new year s eve to valentine s day to graduation and secondarily we will begin to cycle the supply constraints that we saw in 2018 in august so our guide contemplates a full year of continued challenge within helium much the way jim described it but it will be felt disproportionately in the first half of the year curtis nagle bank of america analyst all right thanks very much operator your next question is from william reuter from bank of america your line is open mike bank of america analyst hi guys this is mike ph on for bill so my first question is can you talk about the impact if any that you guys are expecting from the second film of disney s frozen and what it will have on the fiscal year or halloween as you saw weak girls james m harrison director and chief executive officer sure so frozen is a fourth quarter event we are not allowed to sell products associated with the new move frozen 2 until october 4th so somewhere around the end of september our stores the back room of our stores will be packed with lots of frozen product and party product the costumes and decor we anticipate it being a good strong property we don t anticipate that it will be quite a phenomenon that it was back in 2014 2015 but we do expect it to be a strong property i believe the first snippet of the trailer had what number was it daniel j sullivan chief financial officer 116 million in a day james m harrison director and chief executive officer 116 million views in one day so that kind of tells you that the market is ready for it but in terms of being a meaningful event for us in q4 as i said earlier when we looked last year at halloween the costume side of the business it was really the juvenile girls side of the business that was really the weakest and so to the extent that frozen will be a strong property we see it potentially filling that void which fundamentally really has a customer that we are accustomed to having making a alternative product selection with respect to the frozen images i look at frozen really as having a bit of a tailwind in q4 and hopefully a better tailwind as we go into 2020 as it continues to gain momentum and they got dvd and all the other forms of streaming media that helps support a property for a longer period of time ryan t vero president retail and there s just one other thing worth noting is the movies official release date is in november and so we ll be obviously marketing off the hype of the movie and the buildup to the launch of the movie there is some limit to the product that you can sell prior to the actual movie launch as well so we ll obviously have all of that product in the stores ready to go in early october for halloween but it will be in advance of the movie s release james m harrison director and chief executive officer right but on the subject of ip there s a lot of good ip this year outside of frozen there s the new descendants which should be very strong for the team and young adult female there s a movie called uglydolls which should do very well for juvenile and then on the marvel side there is ryan t vero president retail avengers james m harrison director and chief executive officer the avengers and then the toy story 4 and then there is aladdin and then there is lion king so it s a pretty pretty robust pipeline from the major studios of ip and then when you couple that with what s going on in the gaming world as well as some of the more tertiary licenses that have a bit of a pop potentially this year we look at ip really being a nice driver particularly in q4 but at the end of the day from a standpoint of frozen it s probably going to be a much more significant 2019 event ryan t vero president retail 2020 james m harrison director and chief executive officer 2020 i apologize thank you ryan mike bank of america analyst thanks and then just lastly should we expect any franchise repurchases in the next fiscal year james m harrison director and chief executive officer as i said in my remarks this year is the year where we re going to focus on the paydown of debt and as a result unless there s an extraordinarily opportunistic opportunity out there we would not anticipate doing any franchisee acquisitions mike bank of america analyst great thanks so much operator thank you there are no further questions at this time this concludes our q a session i will now turn the call back over to our management for closing remarks james m harrison director and chief executive officer thank you very much

thanks kevin and good morning everyone ferro reported another strong year of growth in 2018 revenue increased 15 adjusted eps increased 16 and adjusted ebitda increased 5 ferro generated strong cash flow with free cash flow conversion of more than 51 in addition as of the end of 2018 we delivered our 10th consecutive quarter of organic growth to the ferro team around the world i extend my congratulation on these excellent results advertisement advertisement ferro s year over year improvement in financial performance demonstrates that we now have a portfolio of businesses substantially stronger than we had several years ago when we implemented our value creation strategy we have elevated the quality of our portfolio by divesting non core assets and making acquisitions that expand our leadership in higher growth higher margin niche markets now in the dynamic innovation and optimization phase of our strategy we are investing in these enhanced technology platforms within our portfolio to drive new product development and fuel organic growth at the same time we are advancing optimization initiatives to improve productivity and efficiency such as the america s manufacturing consolidation project we announced in june we are pleased with the innovation and optimization objectives achieved to date and excited about the opportunities ahead you can see the positive results produced so far and the favorable trajectory that has developed in the charts included on the first page of our earnings release we believe ferro is positioned for long term sustainable value creation for 2019 we expect to continue to generate growth in revenue and profitability that compares favorably with our industry our peers are reporting softening in some markets and we will not be immune to such conditions however ferro will continue to bring new products to market as we expand into new markets and we will continue to optimize our operations we remain confident that ferro will continue to grow revenue and profitability in 2019 even if at a somewhat slower pace than in 2018 advertisement advertisement with all the talk about uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions let s focus a minute on the optimization side of our strategy optimization initiatives are designed to enable ferro to lift profitability even when we encounter softness in market conditions we see significant optimization opportunities within our business today and we are moving forward with initiatives so that we can drive profitability even if broader market conditions soften the america s manufacturing optimization initiative that we announced last month is one such opportunity this initiative is expected to contribute 8 million to adjusted ebitda in 2019 and approximately 30 million by the end of 2020 now taking a global perspective on our optimization initiatives over the past two years we have consolidated six manufacturing sites and other facilities and by early 2020 we expect to consolidate an additional seven manufacturing sites including those affected by the america s manufacturing optimization initiative in other words we are working hard on optimization now so that even if market conditions weaken in the future we can still deliver market leading improvements in profitability now let me say a word about the fourth quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter along with the raw material cost headwinds that we encountered during much of the year we also experienced mix in customer order patterns that negatively impacted margins as we previously reported seasonal destocking and inventory repositioning were higher than usual particularly by customers of our higher end tile products previously these customers were carrying approximately six to eight months of finished goods but with the destocking in the fourth quarter this was reduced to about three to four months as a result we experienced a negative impact to margins due to the decline in high end volume and a relative increase in middle market volume and as we previously reported orders for performance colors and glass products were pushed into 2019 due to capacity utilization footprint optimization initiatives while we were disappointed with the circumstances at the end of 2018 we are pleased at the way our business model is delivering strong year over year growth in revenue and profitability we also were pleased with the cash flow generated by the business in 2018 which gives us flexibility to invest in acquisitions buy back shares and pay down debt as appropriate advertisement advertisement now i ll turn to the performance of our three business segments for the fourth quarter and full year in the presentation deck you can see some of these on slides six and seven our fourth quarter and full year performance for our three main business segments let s begin with performance coatings in the fourth quarter performance coatings volumes increased 7 7 while net sales on a constant currency basis increased 12 8 organic sales increased 3 8 adjusted gross profit declined slightly to 36 5 million gross profit margin declined to 20 3 from 23 1 reflecting the shift in mix in volume resulting from the destocking and inventory repositioning that i mentioned earlier for the full year 2018 performance coatings volumes increased 11 9 while net sales increased 24 5 to 733 9 million organic sales grew 3 7 adjusted gross profit increased year over year to 166 7 million gross profit margin for the year was 22 7 compared with 25 5 in the prior year during 2018 the performance coatings segment was affected by significantly elevated raw material prices now we expect the destocking that we experienced in the fourth quarter to carry into the first quarter of 2019 while we anticipate improvement for the remainder of 2019 as high end market inventories return to their usual size before moving to our next business segment i should point out that to counter the industry challenges we encountered during 2018 the performance coatings team did a great job implementing price increases reformulating products and optimizing brand spend advertisement advertisement now let s look at our performance colors and glass segment in the fourth quarter performance colors and glass volumes declined 2 1 with net sales on a constant currency basis down 2 7 organic sales declined 4 1 adjusted gross profit increased to 38 7 million gross profit margin declined to 32 9 from 34 5 for the full year performance colors and glass volumes increased 12 7 with net sales on a constant currency basis up 8 1 to 487 5 million organic sales grew 6 4 adjusted gross profit increased year over year to 167 5 million gross profit margin for the year was 34 4 down from 35 9 in the prior year for over a year pcg s growth in the auto market has been strong as demand for our product applications increased and we took market share in the fourth quarter of 2018 our pcg auto sales were down 2 7 as global auto builds declined approximately 6 mainly as a result of the slowdown in asia inaudible for the full year 2018 our pcg auto business grew 7 4 continuing our long track of market outperformance driven by asia which was up 14 and europe which was up 8 and offset by a decline in the us of about 7 demand was muted in the quarter for ferro s electronic materials with sales down 3 year over year for 2018 sales increased 10 4 looking ahead we are excited about the growth potential for this business our electronic materials go into sensors dielectric and capacitors which are used in fast growing areas like intelligent automation the number of sensors per product in a variety of markets for example has been rising as products are made more intelligent and this in turn drives demand for our high performance materials and sensors fourth quarter sales for our industrial product line declined by 10 3 mainly as a result of customers delaying the orders for our dip tech printers as they anticipated new printer technology that we unveiled late last year for the year industrial sales increased 11 2 advertisement advertisement ferro is a technology leader in functional glass coatings we are leveraging our technical knowledge and innovation capabilities to fuel future growth among the market following this mega trend including the intelligent automation 5g smart cars and led now turning to the color solutions segment summary in the fourth quarter color solutions delivered strong sales and profit growth net sales on a constant currency basis increased 19 4 while volumes were down 1 2 organic sales increased 14 7 adjusted gross profit increased to 33 4 million gross profit margin expanded to 34 1 from 31 1 for the full year 2018 color solutions net sales increased 7 8 to 391 million while volume was down 5 organic sales grew 5 6 adjusted gross profit increased to 129 million gross profit margin for the year increased to 33 up from 32 5 in the prior year fourth quarter sales growth for the color solutions business was due in large part to the continued strong demand for our surface technology product we are seeing robust demand in this business from memory chip makers who use our highly engineered inaudible in their manufacturing process we experienced a softening in the inaudible colors which are used in inaudible as customers worked on inventories due to slower housing construction demand for inaudible automotive applications also declined inaudible however demand for our specialty pigments in these military applications was strong now a brief comment on our balance sheet we are taking a very prudent orientation to our balance sheet maintaining the leverage margin ph we intend to deploy capital as we do most appropriate more acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayment advertisement advertisement so to sum it all up ferro delivered another very good year in 2018 we showed strong growth in revenue and profitability and generated significant cash flow and again i extend my thanks and congratulations to our associates around the world for another strong year with that i ll turn the call over to ben for his comments benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer thank you peter and good morning everyone i d like to start out this morning discussing our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 please note that the non gaap numbers i refer to are on an adjusted basis and growth rates mentioned are on a constant currency basis all comparisons are versus the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 the financial highlights and results can be reviewed on slides three four and five in the presentation accompanying today s call which you can find on ferro com in the investors section advertisement advertisement starting with the fourth quarter we grew net sales 9 1 to 395 5 million with organic sales growth of 3 6 adjusted gross profit increased 3 5 to 108 8 million adjusted sg a expense was 66 4 million or 16 8 of net sales we grew adjusted ebitda by 6 4 to 56 1 million or 14 2 of net sales and adjusted eps increased 13 8 to 0 33 now turning to slide five i ll go through our full year 2018 performance we grew net sales 14 9 to 1 6 billion adjusted gross profit increased 7 4 to 462 3 million adjusted gross profit margin was 28 7 adjusted sg a expense was 257 2 million or 16 of net sales we grew adjusted ebitda by 12 to 259 1 million or 16 1 of net sales and adjusted eps increased 16 3 to 1 50 with that i ll review one time adjustments for the fourth quarter and provide an overview of certain items within our financial statements for the fourth quarter there were a few non gaap adjustments primarily related to our corporate development acquisition and optimization activities as well as our annual mark to market adjustment for our pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities first in cost of sales we had adjustments of approximately 3 7 million for the fourth quarter primarily due to acquisitions and costs related to optimization initiatives in sg a we had one time adjustments of 4 6 million in the quarter consisting of legal professional and other expenses related to certain corporate development activities certain optimization initiatives including the manufacturing optimization we announced in january of this year turning to restructuring and impairment there was an adjustment of approximately 2 9 million in the fourth quarter related to actions to achieve our ongoing optimization initiative and acquisition synergies in the quarter under other income and expense we had an adjustment of about 17 6 million this was primarily related to pension and other post retirement mark to market adjustments of 18 3 million with an offset in earn out adjustments related to acquisitions that are beyond the measurement period finally we have adjusted out or removed a benefit in the fourth quarter of approximately 4 5 million as a result of clarification to the tax cuts and jobs act and the revaluation of certain tax assets in our americas region the fourth quarter adjusted sg a expense was 66 4 million or 16 8 of net sales compared with 67 8 million or 18 7 of net sales in the prior year quarter as stated on a constant currency basis newly acquired businesses accounted for the increase we continue to see good operating leverage as we grow the top line while maintaining relatively flat sg a at the base company level interest expense for the quarter was 8 7 million compared to 7 8 million in the prior year quarter and for the year interest expense was 33 million compared to 27 8 million in the prior year we ended the year with an adjusted tax rate of 22 7 compared to a 27 tax rate in 2017 the decline in the rate year over year was primarily driven by the utilization of fully valued tax credit and the release of certain valuation allowance we do not currently expect these impacts to repeat in 2019 this brings me to cash flow we are very pleased with the efforts our team has made to improve the efficiency of the balance sheet in 2019 for the fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations was an inflow of 146 1 million which compares to an inflow of 55 5 million for the prior year quarter for the year we improved our adjusted free cash flow by 105 5 to 189 1 million compared to 86 4 million in the prior year we define adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations as gaap net cash provided by operating activities less capex then we add back cash used for our most significant optimization projects acquisition related items and restructuring activity the most meaningful components for the full year 2018 are as follows starting with gaap net income of 80 9 million we add 57 6 million of depreciation and amortization 21 9 million in working capital 15 million of change in other balance sheet items 7 5 million of other non cash p l items to arrive at cash generated from operating activities of 182 8 million on a gaap basis then we subtract 80 6 million of capital expenditures and cash received on other receivables of 7 million to arrive at 109 2 million of free cash flow for the year our practice has been to adjust this number for cash flow related to our strategic activities these include one cash related to our optimization project two m a related cash flow and three cash to our restructuring programs the quantification of those three adjustments for the year are as follows 58 4 million for the optimization projects 12 3 million related to m a and 9 2 million related to restructuring when we add these items back to our gaap numbers this brings adjusted free cash flow for the year to 189 1 million or 73 cash conversion i ll also note that this figure reflects the benefit of approximately 57 million from the ar facility we closed in the fourth quarter without that benefit cash conversion would have been 50 9 consistent with our increased guidance next i d like to share the company s capital deployment activity in 2018 in the fourth quarter the company repurchased approximately 660 000 shares for approximately 11 8 million in the year the company deployed approximately 145 million in investments the company repurchased 1 5 million shares for 28 8 million we intend to continue repurchasing shares as circumstances and prices warrant in the year the company also invested approximately 75 million in acquisitions and 41 million related to the optimization project we announced last month and finally the company ended the year with leverage of 2 8 times consistent with our expectations of being less than 3 times so this concludes my prepared remarks on the fourth quarter and the full year for 2018 now i d like to spend some time reviewing our 2019 guidance we expect to deliver sales growth in the range of 3 to 4 or 5 5 to 6 5 on a constant currency basis adjusted gross profit margin within a range of 30 2 to 30 5 adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales of 16 6 to 16 8 other income and expense in a range of 5 5 million to 6 5 million interest expense to be in a range of 36 million to 39 million and we expect our tax rate to be between 26 5 to 27 5 these metrics translate to 2019 full year guidance of adjusted ebitda in a range of 280 million to 290 million which would be up nominally 8 to 12 or 10 to 15 on a constant currency basis over 2018 adjusted eps in a range of 1 55 to 1 65 an increase of 3 to 10 or 7 to 14 on a constant currency basis over 2018 and adjusted free cash flow conversion between 45 and 50 this cash flow should yield between 125 million and 140 million of adjusted free cash flow for 2019 from that range we will subtract additional spending on the optimization project we announced last month and non restructuring actions this cash generation we anticipate leverage being 2 2 times to 2 5 times at the end of 2019 before any acquisition related spending to be consistent with our previous practice 2019 guidance reflects foreign exchange spot rates as of 12 31 2018 at 1 147 for the euro we have provided fx sensitivity in the guidance section of the earnings release in 2018 ferro generated approximately 40 to 45 of revenue in euros and approximately 25 to 30 in us dollars we estimated that a 1 overall change in foreign currency exchange rate weighting for the countries where we do business would impact sales by approximately 10 million to 12 million and operating profit by 1 5 million to 1 7 million if you isolate the sensitivity on euro a 1 change would impact operating profit by approximately 1 1 million to 1 3 million at this point keeping with prior practices i would like to spend a few minutes bridging our adjusted ebitda and eps guidance starting with adjusted ebitda of 259 million from 2018 you add organic growth of 5 million to 7 million then you add 7 million to 9 million for our optimization programs then you add 8 million to 10 million for price versus raw material tailwind then we add another 18 million for the acquisitions we completed in 2014 and finally we subtract a headwind of 7 million due to fx the sum of those items to the 2018 adjusted ebitda of 259 million equals our guidance range of 280 million to 290 million now turning to our walk for eps starting at our adjusted eps for 2018 of 1 50 we add 0 03 to 0 05 from organic growth then we add 0 04 to 0 06 for our optimization program to that we add 0 05 to 0 07 from acquisitions we completed in 2018 then we add 0 05 to 0 07 for our price versus raw material tailwind and then we subtract 0 04 to 0 05 for the change in our tax rate from 2018 and subtract 0 03 to 0 04 for increased interest expense finally we subtract about 0 05 for fx headwind the sum of those pieces to the 2018 adjusted eps of 1 50 equals our guidance range of 1 55 to 1 65 for 2019 further i d like to give some context into how we view the quarters through 2019 we expect the second and third quarter to be our strongest earning quarters similar to the earnings distribution in 2018 on an adjusted basis given the expense of the destocking in performance coatings in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2019 we expect this to impact the first quarter s earnings we expect the first quarter adjusted eps to be in the range of 16 to 18 at the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance range of 1 55 to 1 65 in context we are very pleased with the performance of the business in 2018 and the sustainable revenue and earnings growth we are pleased with the way the business is positioned as a leading technology based functional coatings and color solutions company and we remain focused on keeping the business agile to adapt to changing market conditions with that i ll now turn the call over to kevin for q a kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate relations operator please open up the call for the first question questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question comes from rosemarie morbelli of g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good morning everyone peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer good morning rosemarie benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer good morning rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so just starting with something ben just said it looks as though if my math is correct that the first quarter eps is going to be around 0 28 which compares with 0 36 last year so what makes you comfortable looking at the full year what are the improvements you are looking at in the next three quarters because you have to generate quite a lot of growth in those last three quarters and i know ben gives us the details of the pluses and minuses but a little more of the underlying operations would be and markets would be helpful peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer hi rosemarie it s peter it all starts with the fact that we did notice continued destocking at our higher end markets not only within tile but a couple of the other businesses that continued through the first quarter and more importantly a lot of the tile products at the high end continue through the month of february and if you take a look at that destocking in total for the company in the first quarter it really makes up the difference from last year and you heard in my prepared remarks the magnitude of the destocking and it s actually a good news bad news story when you reposition yourself in the higher end markets because companies typically have more finished goods inventory because they typically carry more skus because of the diverse market applications and that was the first time that we ve seen something like that in fact you heard me mention that the high end tile producers which by the way is as close as we get to a consumer product that has fashion orientation to it that they typically would have six to eight months of finished goods versus the bottom cut or the mid cut which could be two to three months so when there is an inventory destocking that we ve seen for the first time since 2016 it usually goes through the fourth quarter into the first quarter so we feel very comfortable where we sit today that all the destocking has taken place across all of our high end markets throughout the business and we re already starting to see a repositioning of inventory not just filling there is also another dimension of destocking with the higher end markets that they reposition their inventory through mix changes and that s why it typically takes a little bit longer for those markets because they since it is product driven and it s some in the case of tile fashion statement they have to purge out and then take a look forward through their s op process what styles will be in demand over the course of the year and that repositioning had to take place and we re already starting to see the build so we feel comfortable that the destocking is over we do see a demand picking up you ll see more of it moving into certainly the second quarter and why do we feel comfortable that we ll deliver again it gets back to our model around our deliveries and commitment of gdp plus 1 to 2 we will continue to drive new products we ve seen in a lot of new application areas we ve seen in color solutions where our growth rate was pretty solid in the fourth quarter and for the year so our expectation again is that we will continue to outperform the market and again last year you saw it with automotive where we are up 7 while the market was down we re going to be up again this year in that space where most of the reports suggest there ll be a contraction in automotive so if you take a look at five or six different sub market segments where we participate we will continue to outperform the market and we are launching a lot of new products this year so we feel very good and confident that we ll deliver what we re saying benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer hey rosemarie the other thing to just to add to what peter said in terms of i think what peter went through was a lot of context around the first quarter versus the other three quarters in 2019 just a data point on the first quarter versus last year is as you recall the euro last year in the first quarter was much closer to 1 21 and 1 22 versus the 1 145 or so that we have in guidance for this year so that 0 36 from last year has got 0 04 or 0 05 of currency in it rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and thanks that is helpful i am assuming that you expect the impact from fx to diminish as the year unfolds maybe in the second half benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer of course yeah as those rates get tighter that will happen in the third and certainly in the fourth quarter rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so peter i apologize if you talked about it but you came out came through very muddled so i couldn t get everything you said so when you talked about the high end tile producers usually having a six to eight months of inventories where do they stand now and where does ferro stand in the products that are sold into that particular market peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so what we ve noticed is a contraction of about 50 through the fourth quarter and through february so they re probably standing on our average estimate at somewhere between three and four months and the expectation is through the course of the year they will ramp up to what would be a traditional amount and that s why we feel comfortable that the volume will be coming back rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and where is your inventory level is it about three to four months as well did you come down at the same rate peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer you mean ours our rosemarie morbelli g research analyst right on ferro s inventory peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer at the customer here rosemarie morbelli g research analyst both places peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes at the customer level they may only take a couple of months of our inventory and they re starting to rebuild their inventory level at that point and as it relates to our tile inventory do we discuss that individually no we don t go through that with each individual let me put it to you this way we ve done a very good job with cash conversion as you ve seen so we have ratcheted down our inventory across all the business segments rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and one last question and then i ll get back in queue could you talk about the countries where you see the most issues in 2019 we know europe is slowing we know asia pacific is slowing or at least china is so if you could give us a little more that would be helpful peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so we see everything that all of our peer group sees in everything you ve mentioned however what i will say again because of our business model we will continue to outperform the markets where we focus today so in china most of what we see is a slowdown of automotive which was very important for us last year at about 14 growth and this year we do expect growth in that area not at the 14 level but certainly above what the pundits ph are suggesting a 2 to 3 growth there so we do feel good why do we feel good is for two major reasons one what you have to think about with ferro is the content forget about i think we need to make sure everyone understand don t focus on inventory don t focus on bills you need to focus on content the more glass that a car has the more demand for ferro glass now i ll give you an example if you look over the past five years ferro s content has increased by 30 because of more glass in a lot of the higher end cars in particular i mean you see a lot of the cars have more glass roofs panoramic roofs ph and that s good for us so focus on the fact that ferro one has developed new products that outperform the competition and number two the demand for our content is very significant and so we feel really good about that both in asia and also europe where you see areas where people believe that automotive is slowing we will not slow down as much the third piece just to give you an example again in mexico which is pretty much truck oriented ferro is the leader in that area for our type of products for truck production that s indigenous to mexico and also export to the us so we feel really good about that particular model and again every one of the businesses i do want to mention this we increased our market share across every business last year and we did it through new product introduction aligned with the market leaders in the spaces where we participate it wasn t done on price and again don t forget that s the backbone of our gdp plus plus model because we re doing it now with the fifth year of a very strong vitality index which means that we have own technology with the market leaders and they typically launch a disproportionate ph amount of new products of course that carries us with it so that gives the math is on our side and it will be again this year as you can see by the growth that we showed between 5 5 to 6 5 and ferro s proxy by the way based on the data the data that we use is about 2 6 2 5 so everybody should feel good about our ability to continue with another four quarters of organic growth operator thank you our next question comes from mike sison of keybanc please go ahead michael sison keybanc capital markets analyst hey guys price mix is going to be a big a bigger plus this year can you maybe walk through which raw materials and maybe which segments will capture that positive price mix benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer sure mike hey good morning for the most part mike we re going to see the benefit in performance coatings that s where we saw most of the headwinds last year so if you think about last year we saw a net headwind of about 9 million most the vast majority of that was in performance coatings in fact the other two businesses were about a push and the tailwind that we ll see this year also we ll see a lot of that reverse around a lot of that we ll see in cobalt we ve seen a significant movement in cobalt from the first two quarters of last year and so the biggest piece of the benefit that we ll see this year will be in cobalt but we re seeing it across a number of raw materials but that s the biggest one michael sison keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then peter can you maybe talk about the acquisition environment and i think your annual goal to pick up 100 million in sales per year how does that look and any particular areas you are focusing on to add to your portfolio this year peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes so i m glad you brought that up this early we want to make sure i think you caught it in ben s prepared remarks where we would talk about always our framework would be 100 million to 150 million of invested capital for our deals and if you noticed last year we introduced the concept of 100 million to 150 million of invested capital in the strategic investments and the reason why we did that is because we knew we were spending more money on our optimization program and also we were buying back stock and because of the sensitivity about the optimization project we didn t really want to bring that up earlier and since we just started to buy back the stock we want to make sure that everyone understands we re being very judicious and prudent about how much money we spend so right now we would look at optimization projects additional optimization projects more stock buybacks here in the near term as well as our acquisitions to account for that 100 million to 150 million of invested capital for let s call strategic investment however that doesn t say last year we spent 75 million in deals that doesn t mean that we didn t have up to 150 million to 200 million because at any point in time we do and we continue to work on a whole range of deals and our pipeline has increased once again and what you ll hear us talk about aside from the 50 we always talk about five that we re always in discussions with which we are we can sit here and honestly tell you that we re engaged with five different activities with discussions but as it relates to the magnitude of the dialog what we ve also decided is that because we have beefed up our m a department and more people are engaged we can probably take on a little more activity around having discussions so that we can increase that vibe a little bit with the idea that we may spend a little more time on looking at things that are not so much to add technology platforms like with the 20 that we ve acquired but something now that s more meaningful around extending the three businesses ok because what we mentioned and this is a very important point that those 20 acquisitions that we did over the past four years if you really dissect them you ll find that as we stated that we were acquiring leadership technology positions that we felt we needed to win moving forward so when we started this journey ferro had a market leadership in about 70 different technology platforms and with the 20 acquisitions we now have 51 and our technology portfolio is very very sound that we believe we ve covered all the gaps that we would feel existed in our leadership positions in a way that for the next three to five to seven years we are going to be in pretty good shape so it s probably time for us to look out at things that might be a little bit bigger not gigantic i m not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of things but maybe something that s a little bit bigger than some of the deals we ve done to put equal time in those as well as the smaller deals just to keep the momentum going so we have about 13 of those right now that we were having conversations internally and externally with so we feel pretty good about the pipeline it still remains rich and we feel very good about that michael sison keybanc capital markets analyst great thank you peter operator thank you our next question comes from mike harrison seaport global securities please go ahead jacob schowalter seaport global securities analyst good morning this is jacob on for mike sticking with m a just wanted to get an update how the integration is progressing on the acquisitions you ve completed over in the second half of 2018 any notable success stories you want to point out peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer the acquisitions are running fine the integrations are fine if you look at we ll be running a make good for our board coming up in april and we were just reviewing it yesterday as a matter of fact and we felt very very good on our presentation to the board on what we ve been able to accomplish in terms of delivering against our synergy commitment remember those 20 deals represent about 150 million of synergies which would be over a five year period at the onset of when we acquired them and what i can tell you without being specific is that we re ahead of schedule with delivering against those synergies and we re not finding anything that s abstract or anything that concerns us and so we feel pretty good on our integration model and our ability to absorb those entities in a very efficient and orderly methodical way jacob schowalter seaport global securities analyst all right and then we ve touched on the destocking in high end tile coatings i was curious the underlying demand trends that you guys are seeing as we move through this destocking period has that sort of stayed stable or has it improved in january and february maybe some comments on the underlying demand peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes so what s really interesting and this is a good point thanks for asking it if you look at our tile business for the year all in on constant currency on a revenue basis it was up 31 8 including the acquisitions but it was up close to double digit regardless even in the fourth quarter so the demand is still there but remember we have a bifurcated kind of a business model with tire where you have high end and we also have the mid cut and there still remains some straggling of lower end and the demand at the lower end in the mid cut continues to continue to be ok through the fourth quarter as you noticed because i mentioned that our revenue and volume was up in the fourth quarter for that business but it was at the high end so the good news is we expect a very very good growth for the tile business again this year all in with all the businesses and as i mentioned to rosemarie we can see that the higher end is starting to pick up and always remember that when things go bad the high end will still be in demand because of the nature of the technology and you re talking about a differential of high end tiles can range on a square meter price spaces anywhere between 25 and 35 a square yet the mid cut that could be 8 to 9 the low cut could be 3 to 5 and even when times are tough people will spend those who have the wherewithal will continue to buy the high end we see no change in that dynamic other than that the stocking that took place mostly because demand did slow down overall in the second half of the year and those inventory levels were built because demand in 16 17 and the first half of 18 were pretty strong and there are a bunch there was a new recently there was a tile show and that s typically where all the new designs take place and that s one of the reasons why things started up so late where all the new fashion was highlighted and put on display and so all those customers are now ramping up with their new product lines so we feel really good about the continued growth in that business because of our leadership position number one we have a low cost position number three we do have the market leadership position in the high end now jacob schowalter seaport global securities analyst all right thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from david begleiter deutsche bank please go ahead david wang deutsche bank analyst hi this is david wang here for david i guess specifically on europe how is the underlying demand by end market and country peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yes so as everyone has noted europe we see a general slowdown in europe you can clearly see it particularly with us we would notice it more than anything in the pigment side of the business but relative to what s coming out in terms of gdp growth for europe or by automotive or construction what we can tell you we do see a softness but again compared to with the data coming out in every sub segment whether it s auto whether it s construction whether it s pigments whether it s deco whether it s sensors or whatever we are outperforming the market as it s been presented by the trade documents so we see it but again our model is when things are really good we ll do better when things are soft we won t be as soft and we re clearly seeing that now and i think that s one of the really good things about what we ve created here over the past six years is that in an environment which when things are great we ll do better if things are soft we won t go down as much and that s exactly what you re seeing in 2019 exactly the case that really underscores the value that we ve created this model to withstand headwinds like this and the fact that we have a robust pipeline and optimization activities whether we get it from revenue we certainly have a combined activity around cost management and optimization and greater efficiency and that s what you re seeing in 19 you re seeing the benefit of that major optimization program in addition to continued vitality index of about that 20 that s producing what we believe is a very strong guidance relative to the space david wang deutsche bank analyst thanks and just on q4 color solutions i guess you guys have good positive volume mix number in q4 and you talked about volume down slightly does that mean there is a big mix contribution in q4 for color solutions and if so where does that come from peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer so i think i had mentioned it in my prepared remarks but let me underscore it with our vitality index in all of our r d programs we introduced the topic maybe about a year ago a little more ago that we might have some what we define as being off cycle activities which means that if we have a new product introduction particularly in the high end spaces it takes time for gestation to take place in those spaces because of the high end nature and we introduced some new products in the beginning of the year that are finally starting to gain some traction in the second half of last year particularly in the fourth quarter now moving into this year that we have a hit on and in this case in that business it has to deal with surface technologies and our key our position with proprietary and very interesting and technologically advanced polishing activities that we can t talk too much about but certainly that has helped us in the second half of last year mostly in the fourth quarter because it s starting to ramp up david wang deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john mcnulty bmo capital markets please go ahead bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning this is bhavesh lodaya for john benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer good morning peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer good morning bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst hi so the first one regarding the seven plant rationalization you mentioned what are the segments that should benefit from this the most and can you remind us how the 30 million of profit lift is spread through the divisions peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer here s what we can say on this every business unit that we have will benefit from that optimization activity and if you think about the remarks over the past two and a half years it was more of we are going to create a state of the art kind of a manufacturing capability that stretches across one ferro in a way that makes us the most efficient producer with each one of those market segments with the most contemporary equipment automation our supply chain activities everything is very very efficient and very contemporary so each one of the businesses will benefit from that activity and that s probably something that is very important because we should do that and be the most efficient producer as a market leader around the world bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst got it and then can you speak to the efficiency program in a bit more detail as in like do you have the ability to accelerate that program a bit given the slower macro backdrop right now benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the program continues to be to operate on schedule obviously we re we re pushing that to the sort of as planned the rollout of that the rollout of that new program is important from a cadence perspective so we re actually marching pretty close to what we thought we would bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst got it one final question from my side regarding some of the timing issues you saw in the color and glass business tied to some of your restructuring moves how should we be thinking about that going forward do you foresee any other temporary blips as we progress through the year or was this kind of like a one off peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think what s really important to note is that what you are seeing is that our new product development pipeline program is working extremely well maybe quite candidly a bit better than we might have anticipated and we have a challenge a little bit here that the demand was a little bit greater than we could fulfill in the short term but we are adjusting to it and we ll be able to handle it going forward and a lot that happens a lot with a lot of the new high end technology activities across our businesses that may be let s call it new to the world type activities and not just new to ferro or just new new but new to the world sometimes you have some start up delays and we just have to catch up to it and we had a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter but we feel very good here that we have that under control bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst great thanks for the time kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate relations operator we have time for one last question operator thank you our final question comes from rosemarie morbelli of g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you peter i was wondering talking about your comments regarding acquisitions what are we thinking what are you thinking in terms of potential size of the three nubiola something bigger and how much leverage are you willing to take in this uncertain environment peter t thomas chairman president and chief executive officer okay so what we re thinking rosemarie again i think you understand the model from the very beginning because you ve been with us and as we started this process we had a lot of discussions back in 12 and 13 about how we needed to build this business to be a successful model that was going to be orderly methodical and we would define different phases and really define a bunch of strategic priorities around those phases in a way that everyone in the company was aligned they were incented around those phases and we would just continue to move to a point where we are today where we completely have a different ferro you can see that particularly last year we had the best year in the history of our company particularly with most of the financial metrics as you know we had double digit and of course our stock doesn t reflect that but of course we did have double digit growth in most of our ph financial metrics but again we re at a point now where we feel very comfortable we plugged all the technology gaps so now it s sort of like we need we want to add some more smaller technologies but we d like to do something a bit more meaningful again maybe i would use nubiola as a case that it would be good to have another nubiola type the financial metrics like that maybe a little bit bigger but nothing that should cause any one a concern because at the end of the day quite candidly rosemarie we worked really hard last year to prove to our shareholders that we are prudent around managing equally the balance sheet and the p l i mean we ve been able to manage this very very well and at the end of the day if you asked us what s important the p l or the balance sheet for the last half of last year and the fourth quarter we would tell you it s the balance sheet we had a commitment of delivering a certain level of cash and we wanted to get our leverage down and we did that so our teams are very good around understanding that dynamic of hey there is a p l time there is a balance sheet time but in the spirit of this we have to keep beating ourselves every year so even in that environment where some may think it was a little abstract for us it shows you the strength of our business model that one we did grow double digits in every financial metric and shame on us for coming out with a guidance last year that was so far more robust than everybody else that you end up kind of getting penalized for it but at the end of the day we delivered a record performance and we delivered the cash we said and we still had strong p l performance so again right now we re in a zone of we have to really really in this environment watch the balance sheet and watch cash we re not going to do anything stupid right ben benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think i would just underscore what peter said there we felt good about where we ended the year last year from a leverage perspective you heard us go through sort of our leverage targets for the end of this year i would say that what s included in those leverage targets is obviously the cash flow guidance we would typically also have cash charges that we would add back to that for optimization and the restructuring charges those charges in 2018 we would expect from a we announced the significant optimization last month we would expect additional capex related to that this year of about 20 million in addition to additional restructuring charges of about 10 million to 15 million and then we have we have charges from a deals perspective to get those synergies of let s say another 10 million to 15 million and what we ve done is we ve built all of that into our leverage targets this year so the leverage targets that we covered on the call we feel really good about including sort of those one time cash charges that i just went through the only thing that wouldn t be included in there is any deal activity and then our share repurchases which to date this year we ve already made 20 million worth of share repurchases so we re very very focused on leverage you will see leverage spike in the first half of the year we could get up somewhere between let s say 3 2 3 3 times in the first half of the year before we then burn that off back to the previously mentioned target so that just underscores sort of what peter was mentioning around our focus around the balance sheet and leverage in particular going forward rosemarie morbelli g research analyst that is great thank you ben and just wondering if you are still comfortable with your 2020 targets benjamin schlater group vice president and chief financial officer yeah we remain committed to those rosemarie as we announced in november of 2017 our expectation was that we would continue the key pillars of those if you would is whatever the market does we re going to do 1 to 2 on top of that and then on top of that from a optimization perspective we re going to get 2 every year and we remain committed to those metrics through 2020 rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate relations we would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today we appreciate your interest in ferro and we look forward to discussing our results with you again

ll walk through some earnings data for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2018 results i ll then note some interesting changes in investment preferences that took place in the fourth quarter and how we see the year ahead shaping up in the fourth quarter ladder produce core earnings a non gaap measure of 52 5 million or 0 45 per share this resulted in an after tax core return on average equity of 12 9 for the full year 2018 we had core earnings of 230 1 million or 2 03 per share and after tax core return on average equity of 14 9 we are particularly pleased with our performance this year as core earnings per share increased by 31 8 versus 2017 our undepreciated book value increased by 5 1 during the year to 15 34 per share after announcing two increases to our quarterly cash dividend during the year our multi product model served us well in 2018 as our real estate portfolio accounted for 24 of net investment income while our balance sheet loan inventory contributed to another 61 of net investment income to core earnings you may recall that in our last earnings call we voiced some concerns about general market complacency an overly hawkish federal reserve bank chairman and our view that volatility was likely to pick up as we progress into year end the volatility witnessed in december 2018 was expected and produced an excellent opportunity to make high quality investments in securities as ramp in redemption caused the forced selling of many very safe liquid securities particularly clos and short duration cmbs as we are prone to do during periods of high volatility we purchased a relatively large amount of securities in the quarter totaling 468 3 million we purchased these assets at a discount to par and they have a weighted average maturity of less than three years we match funded many of these purchases by borrowing 288 million in the federal home loan bank at an average fixed rate of 2 89 with an average maturity of two years we ve continued to purchase securities into the first quarter of 2019 adding an additional 187 million over the first two months thus far this year while we are acquiring securities we are also witnessing compression of credit spreads in our balance sheet lending business further shifting our focus away from loan origination and toward securities acquisition during the fourth quarter we received loan payoffs in our bridge loan portfolio of 730 9 million roughly three times what we would normally expect in a quarter while we could have held onto many of these loans by simply matching the terms of the refinancing lender the terms being offered usually with higher proceeds at lower rates didn t seem to offer the right risk reward relationship so we collected are pay off with our exit fees and reallocated our capital into what we felt was a better value proposition for our shareholders we did originate 237 9 million in balance sheet loans in the quarter with a weighted average interest rate of 7 75 and we also originated 182 million of first mortgage loans held for securitization during the fourth quarter we also participated in three securitizations all completed before the volatility in december we contributed 364 8 million of loan earning 7 million i m pleased to report that we have also contributed 170 million of loans to a securitization in the first quarter of 2019 however that securitization has not settled yet we ve seen a slowdown in the pace of repayments of our balance sheet loans receiving just 55 million in pay offs at this point in the quarter this is probably the result of the widening of credit spreads in the clo market and the volatility seen in world markets in december while we embarked on an aggressive plan in 2016 to originate more floating rate bridge loans anticipating higher rates after building upon our loan inventory quarter after quarter the fourth quarter of 2018 marked the first time in over two years that our inventory of balance sheet loans fell quarter over quarter at the end of 2018 we still own 3 3 billion of balance sheet loans but for the first time in years our inventory of securities increased by 44 in the quarter ending the year at 1 41 billion this illustrates how flexible and nimble our investment platform is able to pivot quickly into different product types as changing market conditions produce different investment opportunities as we move ahead into 2019 i would like to note that while we seem to have witnessed the v shape recovery from december 2018 into february of 2019 interest rates still have not returned to where they were in november of 2018 the yield on the 10 year u s treasury is still about 50 basis points lower than it was in november while many may chalk that up to more recent fed commentary that expresses patience when raising interest rates we would also note that the two year rate is inverted against the five year treasury rate and the yield curve is still quite flat and this makes us more cautious about what we think lies ahead in the u s economy we continue to be somewhat concerned about slowing global economy trade wars with china emerging talk of future tax policies that don t seem to support growth a possible hard brexit and growing tensions with russia and while we feel that the economy is stable we think real estate valuations and by extension cash flows may have peaked we will be taking a slightly more cautious approach to lending on transitional loans that require execution and timing in a slowing economy we don t think we ve seen the last of the volatility witnessed in december and we will try to position ourselves to exploit investment opportunities that invariably present themselves when liquidity is thin and sellers are forced to sell high quality assets can meet redemption demands that tend to occur during periods of liquidity i ll wrap up now by saying how happy i am with the performance of 2018 of the company i d like to thank our employees and our investors who supported us throughout the year we look forward to 2019 confident that we re well positioned for the year ahead i ll now turn you over to mark fox marc fox chief financial officer thank you brian i will now review ladder capital s financial results for the quarter and year ended december 31 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder generated core earnings of 52 5 million resulting a core eps of 0 45 and an after tax return on average equity of 12 9 the 2018 calendar year core earnings totaled 230 1 million compared to 178 8 million for the year ended 12 31 17 2018 core eps was 2 2 03 per share compared to 1 54 per share earned in 2017 after tax roae for 2018 of 14 9 surpassed 2017 performance of 11 5 ladder s net interest income from loans and securities investments and net rental income from real estate investments totaled 226 9 million in 2018 and was about 25 higher than the 181 million earned in 2017 increases in recurring sources of income have been an ongoing trend since ladder s ipo in 2014 has allowed us to judiciously increased our quarterly cash dividend rate six times over the course of four years most recently in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a gaap basis ladder generated net income of ladder taxes of 27 8 million in the fourth quarter and 228 3 million for the year ended 12 31 18 the the largest gaap to core earnings adjustment in the fourth quarter related to the timing of the recognition of hedge results to coincide with the realization of gains and losses on a disposition of hedged assets in the fourth quarter ladder originated a total of 419 9 million of loans bringing total loan originations to 2 8 billion ladder s balance sheet loan originations exceeded conduit loan originations in 2018 for the first time since inception at the end of 2018 balance sheet loans totaled 3 3 billion in the conduit loan balance stood at 182 4 million also during the fourth quarter ladder reported income from pre securitization transactions to which ladder contributed 364 8 million principal balance of loans held for sale generating 7 million of securitization gains for the 2018 calendar year ladder securitize a total of 103 loans with a total principal balance of 1 3 billion in nine securitization transactions generating a total of 30 million of securitization gains finally during the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder made 7 2 million of net leased and other equity investments resulting in total net leased and other equity investments of 122 7 million in 2018 ladder also received 5 5 million of net proceeds from sales of condominium real estate in the fourth quarter bringing total proceeds from the sales of real estate to 218 7 million for the year turning to key balance sheet and investment activity metrics as of december 31 2018 96 of our debt investments were senior secured including first mortgage loans and commercial mortgage backed securities secured by first mortgage loans which is consistent with the senior secured focus of the company senior secured assets plus cash comprised 76 3 of our total asset base total assets stood at 6 27 billion which is 4 1 higher than at the end of 2017 total unencumbered investments including cash with 2 1 billion at year end and unsecured debt outstanding stood at 1 2 billion reflecting an unencumbered asset to unsecured debt ratio of 1 79 times the weighted average loan to value ratio of the commercial real estate loans on our balance sheet at the december 31 2018 with approximately 68 inline with prior quarters the most meaningful fourth quarter changes to the asset side of the balance sheet were in the securities and balance sheet loan portfolios during the fourth quarter the securities portfolio increased by 431 8 million instead of 1 41 billion at year end ladder responded to the spread widening and general volatility in the fixed income market by purchasing more securities in three months than the company had acquired in the preceding year at the end of the year the key risk metrics of this portfolio remains in line with historic norms as 80 9 of the securities portfolio was comprised of securities rated aaa or backed by a u s government agency and the weighted average duration was 29 months which compares to 30 months at 9 30 18 and 36 months a year prior also during the quarter ladder received 730 9 million of balance sheet loan repayments more than offsetting 237 9 million of balance sheet loan originations during the quarter the net result was a 3 3 billion december 31 2018 balance sheet loan portfolio versus a 3 8 billion portfolio at the end of the prior quarter the weighted average spread to libor and the floating rate loans in the portfolio was 556 basis points at year end compared to 563 basis points at 9 30 18 on the financing side as of 12 31 18 latter had 3 9 billion of adjusted debt outstanding and committed financing availability of 2 6 billion for additional investments at december 31 2018 debt was comprised of 1 17 billion of unsecured bond debt outstanding maturing in 2021 2022 and 2025 743 9 million of long term non recourse mortgage debt financing our real estate holdings and 601 5 million of non recourse clo debt when combined with 1 64 billion of permanent equity and 176 7 million of other liabilities 4 3 billion or 69 of ladder s capital base is comprised of equity unsecured debt and non recourse non mark to market debt at quarter end we had 1 3 billion of fhlb borrowings with a 2 46 year weighted average maturity and an average cost of 2 55 towards the end of the year ladder further diversified its funding sources entering into a new financing agreement with another major bank that is new to ladder to finance both first mortgage and mezzanine loans this new facility provides 100 million of committed availability and this agreement expands our access to loan repurchase financing to a fixed bank in november ladder also successfully accessed the equity market for the first time since our 2014 ipo we issued 5 8 million shares of class a common stock in an underwritten primary public offering resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately 100 million the shares were issued at a price reflecting a 24 premium over a gaap book value and a 12 premium over undepreciated book value ladder s year end undepreciated book value was 15 34 per share up from 15 25 at 9 30 and up from 14 60 at the end of 2017 finally in the fourth quarter ladder paid a 0 57 per share dividend including 0 34 in cash and 0 23 in shares of class a common stock the 0 34 per share cash dividend reflected a 4 increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate the sixth increase in four years dividends in 2018 totaled 1 535 per share of class a common stock with a cash dividend payout ratio of 64 3 ladder s equity base grew to 1 64 billion at year end reflecting an increase of 155 5 million or 10 in 2018 which resulted from strong 2018 performance in the form of 230 1 million of core earnings the 100 million of primary equity issuance in november ladder s continued adherence to a conservative dividend payout ratio supported by a base of growing recurring earnings and the election to pay a 0 23 per share portion of the 2018 dividend in stock instead of cash thus retaining approximately 25 million of equity in the meantime our asset base increased by 4 1 resulting in 2018 year end adjusted leverage of 2 34 times the lowest leverage level since 2014 the result of all this is that ladder entered to 2019 with over 500 million of available liquidity that can be used to take advantage of the opportunities cited when we issued equity in november applying modest leverage to those available funding could result in a 1 billion to 1 5 billion of additional investment assets on ladder s balance sheet over time so summing up in the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder generated 52 5 million of core earnings 0 45 per share of core eps resulting in a core after tax roe of 12 9 bringing 2018 core earnings to 230 1 million or 2 03 per share of core eps we originated 419 9 million of loans and securitized 364 8 million of fixed rate loans resulting in 7 million of net securitization gains we issued 5 8 million shares of class a common stock and our first underwritten primary public offering since the 2014 ipo resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately 100 million and we paid 0 57 per share dividend bringing total 2018 dividend to 1 535 per share of class a common stock in 2018 at this point it s time to open the line for questions and answers questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven delaney with jmp securities please shoot your question steven delaney jmp securities analyst hey good evening everybody thanks for taking my questions obviously a great report one thing you missed though you didn t say anything about your stock being up 35 since the end of 2017 and that was sort of at the top of my list so congrats on that seriously the other thing you didn t talk about is any recent real estate investments recently had the chance to be with one of your peers who also like you makes opportunistic investments and they were really talking down the ability to put any capital to work this year just because of higher prices and brian i appreciate your outlook on that as far as whether you obviously told us what you think about cmbs but i was just curious if you think you ll still be able to find any special sets because the real estate investment has really created a lot of value over the last couple of years thanks brian harris chief executive officer sure thanks steve and thanks for pointing out our recent success i hope that s not the curse of the announcer but i would say that we are not active in the real estate space for acquisitions in the quarter we haven t been terribly active in the first quarter either and that s not really our core business as you know we re always steven delaney jmp securities analyst oh sure brian harris chief executive officer have fielders out i mean we think that there will be some opportunities but i think the answer to the question is twofold one i think things are very expensive and there s a lot of capital around and two i think that we re probably a little more picky given our view of the economy over the next couple of years and it isn t that we think it s going to be bad necessarily we just don t think it s going to be better so we think that you would have to make a real estate investment today based on cash flows today rather than managing better or raising rents later on so we think the opportunity set for real estate as an asset class is not as strong today however steven delaney jmp securities analyst okay brian harris chief executive officer owning real estate through the debt door in the next couple of years might be a much more interesting proposition steven delaney jmp securities analyst got it and you commented on the loan spreads and being tighter almost sounds like to me even the cmbs spreads have come back and clos everything seems to be somewhat back to normal i mean we ve seen your execution on your cmbs you did with wells last week it almost seems though that securities might continue to be a bigger percentage this year just curious if you would care to comment on that and we had the volatility in 4q but it almost sounds like on a relative basis we could see you continue to grow that book brian harris chief executive officer i think that s accurate i can tell you that december you have to be moving quickly to take advantage of opportunities like that and thankfully we were able to do that we had plenty of dry powder and i think that has continued into january and february i think that we ve purchased another 190 million worth of securities in january and february to date so that would probably get us up to around kind of close to 600 million in the last four months or five months that s a lot for us so we are buying things on the short end mainly because we don t want to be hedging interest rates with all of the cash flow and with the flat yield curve that gets a little bit difficult so you want to be in the two year area two and three year and that s where we ve concentrated our efforts i would say though there if you took a look at almost any financial instrument it was really a v shape recovery right went down in december and then right back up into february but there are a couple of selling differences i don t think the clo market has come back all the way and the reason for that is i think the clo market is it s not broadly distributed the clo steven delaney jmp securities analyst right brian harris chief executive officer paper is really in the hands of a few money managers that are capable of understanding what goes into those things and frankly i think it s a very attractive buy but it was bid pretty tightly i would say into june and july of last year where i thought it was a little too aggressive so we do like that right now we are active purchases of clo aaa aa paper we think it s relatively cheap especially when compared to making libor based loans at relatively tight spreads late in the cycle and so we ll continue to do that as long as that opportunity presents itself and as far as the rest of the business just feels ok we are originating loans maybe not at the pace we are originating at when we felt a little more comfortable with where we were in the cycle but there s still plenty of opportunities i think one of the reasons we allocated some capital to securities it was just a better value trade but i also think that we are a little cautious about lending money to people now at higher loan amounts that at tighter spreads and attempting to get paid back in two to three years where we might be in a bit of a downturn so we are very selective right now about who we re lending money to and we re very selective about what rates we ll charge to lend that money out to people and it does seem like many of our competitors and peers are a little bit more aggressive in the space than we are i owe that to the flexibility of our model where we can easily shift over to securitization and the conduit business as well as mine securities so if we can buy the aaa paper from clo of a competitor at 130 and 140 dm which we were doing in december that looks like a better value proposition than libor plus 300 on loans steven delaney jmp securities analyst understood appreciate the comments brian brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please suit your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much brian i wanted to ask if you could share your thoughts on the co working business model it seems to have taking the leasing market by storm and accounts for as much as i don t know something like a third of leasing activity if you look at the commercial real estate brokers the reporting leasing volumes growth of north of 20 year on year and it s clear that the office sector for traditional occupiers is not growing lease occupancy at that rate so wanted to find out what do you think about that brian harris chief executive officer sure i m not an expert on it first of all but it s clearly the the hotelification of the office buildings taking place and i do agree that a lot of office tenants are not renewing nearly the sizes and space that they used to so there you do have to adapt and i do think that especially for new companies it s a very attractive feature because you don t have all of the you have assistance really in moving into these companies so that makes sense and i think the idea behind the weworks of the world and names like that is you put 10 accounts into a building you really hope two or three of them expand greatly and stay in the building i don t know if that s their business plan but that s what i think they re doing but i as far as a lender i am always cautious when you see space in a headline being leaded by a company that s new and oftentimes not making money that always concerns me a little bit so you have to dig into the financials of that company and to see who s guaranteeing that lease but they re signing because effectively what they re doing is they re mass releasing real estate and that s fine if it s a strong in our company but if it s an llc that just has nothing but that space and the cash flows associated with it i would be very cautious around relying too heavily on that but as a business model and as the as technology makes some real estate obsolete and other real estate more portable i think it s fine idea like most good idea as they get a little overdone and i would suspect that when the largest tenants in a city like new york is a temporary space seller to smaller companies i would flash caution at that jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks for that can you give an update on both credit and migration in the quarter it didn t look like there s any notable change in the loss provision so assume credit was stable in the quarter but also on the couple of credit issues you ve experienced what the status update is on those loans brian harris chief executive officer i would say credit any credit problems bubbling up are very similar to the ones that we ve seen before i think credit problems are occurring in particular in operating businesses like hotels and also in non cash flowing businesses that are being repositioned so if you have a construction loan outstanding and there is no cash flow let s say i don t know call it a 100 million loan and if it s out there at a given rate if you need another year that s a very expensive proposition because you have to put up a full year of interest reserves and when you ve got libor at 2 5 instead of 50 where it was few 2 5 years ago that s quite a bit more but as i said i think it s mostly biting into the equity roes at this point and not necessarily causing debt problems having said that i do think that limited service hotels are probably overbuilt i think that the hotel business as a whole is doing fine but i do think it is there are reminders out there that operating businesses are not all real estate so during the quarter in the fourth quarter we actually did have a situation on some hotels in texas that we thought we were going to foreclose on and we began to make moves in that direction however also due to the fact that there is a lot of capital in the world right now and texas is doing very well we did get paid off in full before and ultimately turned it in from that happened that went round tripping in the fourth quarter that became a conversation became a difficult conversation and then it became a pay off in the beginning of december so i would say credit s stable but showing signs of distress on anything that needs to be extended where the borrower is not particularly well capitalized the other situations we ve had as you know we have an office building that we re now part of reserve in wilmington delaware and not much change there it s been a little bit too soon i think given the way we restructured that whole capital stack and the other one was a food emporium on broadway here in manhattan that is in bankruptcy still it is still 100 occupied by bed bath beyond credit for a long term lease i don t understand why it s in bankruptcy but it is still but it is not of a particular concern to us we re under receivership we re receiving cash flow payments and we re just really waiting for that to sort itself out through the bankruptcy system jade rahmani kbw analyst you mentioned securities purchases to date and you mentioned loan repayments to date what about bridge loan and conduit originations in the first quarter thus far brian harris chief executive officer let me take a quick i ve got a pretty good idea of that do you have it pamela pamela mccormack president yeah marc fox chief financial officer yeah pamela mccormack president right now we look on pace more toward on average kind of growth i would say we re expecting to do 500 million to 650 million broken roughly 50 50 maybe a slightly heavier balance toward balance sheet but i think you can see you can expect to see a more regular quarter from us brian harris chief executive officer and i would tell you so far in the first two months we have closed i don t have the breakout between bridge and conduit but we have closed 334 million worth of loan so far marc fox chief financial officer 190 million were balance sheet loans jade rahmani kbw analyst okay thanks for taking the questions brian harris chief executive officer no problem at all operator our next question comes from the line of stephen laws with raymond james please proceed with your question stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions following it up on the last answer was to jade s question can you maybe talk a little bit about the differences and how you think about the underwriting are the volumes for the loans that you plan to put into the conduit versus those you put it to the on to the balance sheet and i guess maybe start with that brian harris chief executive officer same underwriting process there is no difference same people here underwrite both categories and obviously one of them has more cash flow than others so one of them you might have there have a little bit better predictive ability as opposed to this fully stabilized assets that go into the conduit but again the conduit model you re really underwriting in for rating agency guideline and kind of there is a little bit of variation around it but not that much whereas the balance sheet business you can t overlook certain things that maybe a rating agency wouldn t or you can also decide to penalize an item more then a rating agency would so we re cautious on all of our loans and we use the same process but i would tell you that today as opposed to a couple of years ago in the bridge loan business we are not underwriting the expectation of higher cash flows over the next 12 to 24 months we re underwriting stability and if not possibly down cash flows so we don t necessarily things are going think things are going to get better and then a transitional loan i think we have to live in a world where first of all interest rates might go up and we think they won t but they might and if they do that libor cap only helps until you get to the maturity date and then it has to be refinanced so you have to think a little bit more there is a lot more liquidity in the world so you can take a little bit more risk i think in the execution because if a borrower does execute 75 of its business plan he can probably refinance you even though he hasn t got all the cash flow straightened out but if that liquidity dries up on the refinance pipeline then you d have to be you re in an extension conversation where you re going to ask a bar to write a check with additional equity given 730 million in pay offs in the fourth quarter and i ll tell you december didn t get a lot of pay offs because it was such a volatile quarter so that was a hell of a lot of payoffs in that quarter relative to our existence to date having said that i think december put a real holding that clo model because spreads did widen out quite a bit and as a result of that and as i said we re only we ve only received 55 million in pay offs so far in the first quarter so i wouldn t draw too much conclusion from any one quarter but we are underwriting cautiously going forward on bridge loans as well as conduit loans stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst great thanks for the color on that brian and switching gears to the cmbs side how big we do envision that portfolio getting i mean if the environment stays like it is or was for january and february we continued to add it to add it to the cmbs baskets will that reached 2 billion in cmbs will it go higher kind of you how do you think about your portfolio mix moving through the year given the current market environment brian harris chief executive officer well i try not to put a calendar into the answer i would tell you our desire to do our next transaction oftentimes leads to securities during periods of high volatility and we happen to see that in december i think we ll see it again but i don t quote me on this marc you might be able to help i believe we had a cmbs portfolio of over 3 billion at one point marc fox chief financial officer yeah we were approaching 3 billion yes brian harris chief executive officer so to me again when you make a loan you really own the aaa the aa the singe a and bbb and everything else that goes into a normal securitization so it isn t i don t differentiate too much between loans and securities what securities do is they provide you with a degree of safety and the degree of liquidity and so when you can buy very short term high quality assets that are easily financed easily sold and they produce levered returns in the 8 to 9 area that might very well be a better short term investments than making loans that yield an 11 levered because those loans are not that liquid and so we always sometimes it may not be intuitive but we might take a little bit less in yield to live a little bit more safely so your question is do we see it get to the 2 billion i don t see it getting to 2 billion unless there is another few bouts of volatility but if there was a 60 day about of volatility and still you had to do is watch your tv today and you realize there s plenty of things that can cause that that number could go to 3 billion stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst great appreciate the color on that brian and marc thank you very much brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of tim hayes with fbr please proceed with your question tim hayes fbr analyst hey good evening everyone brian i appreciate your comments on credit quality earlier but i just wanted to pick on credit a little bit more directly do you anticipate a pickup in provisions and or losses in your portfolio this year and how does the fed commentary or your view of rates play into this view brian harris chief executive officer i m sorry jim i didn t hear that can you repeat that tim hayes fbr analyst yeah sure no i was just just got to wanted to pick on credit a little bit more directly just wondering if you expect provisions to increase this year and or losses in the portfolio and then just maybe how your view around with plays into that brian harris chief executive officer i think that there will be more stress again i personally think the fed s next move is down not up i know that s an unusual comment but it isn t because i see anything in particular that s problematic in our portfolio i see things in the economy that are problematic and again i think that there maybe just a little bit too much liquidity right now chasing too few transactions so there might be a little bit of over leveraging of a principal column construction loans is typically something that might get into trouble but excuse me those don t hop and show up until a couple years go by because they have interest reserves right now so i would say answer the question by saying i don t think that we ll see less difficulty in our portfolio or real estate in general but i don t think we re going to see any unusual increases in it either so if there the loan underwritings that have been done over the last few years they re reasonably sane there is a reasonable equity in these transactions so i think that you could easily see some maturity defaults or some restructuring without necessarily seeing a loss associated with it tim hayes fbr analyst understood appreciate the comments there and then the gain on sale margin on the conduit transactions in 4q was pretty low compared to historical levels and just wondering directionally if you d expect the margin to improve on the 1q 19 transaction and to be more in line with historical levels okay the first securitization we did i can t get into too much detail because it hasn t settled however i can tell you that in the fourth quarter and i ll go back even till june from june of 2018 through december credit spreads widened almost every month so every securitization we did in the second half of the year we may have made money we did make money on all of them and we are they were profitable but they were not as profitable as we had hoped they would be and i think we made around that 1 9 in the fourth quarter and we were in three securitizations and all three of them in my opinion didn t do very well but again that s why you build in a bigger margin because you can absorb some spread widening while you re out there in the market going into the first quarter we do see flows of funds and they re in the 7 to 10 year intermediate bond area there s a lot of flows going into those funds so that tells me that a lot of investors are not afraid of the fed raising rates and they re not afraid to buy longer paper even though there s a flat yield curve in addition to that the insurance companies with their fresh allocations have arrived in january they generally like to get through their allocations before the summer and so this is a seasonally aggressive period for lenders there s a lot of competition in the first and second quarters tends to lighten up a a little bit in the second half of the year really after july 4th so it s a little hard for me to say what i think profit margins will be i do think that there is a lack of supply loan demand is not terribly strong but i do think that that flat yield curve fear has left the market at least for the near term so and i ll also give you a little factoid in that these january the securitization we did in 2019 obviously was loans that were closed before 19 interest rates on the 10 year fell dramatically and they have not returned to where they were so the 10 year interest rate on u s treasury is about 10 50 basis points lower today than it was back in november and so when loan when rates fall dramatically like that that s usually good for us even though it does invite more competition but that would be in a high loan demand market which december was not but on the other hand we have floors in our loans and when you have floors in your loans as you re closing them your spreads are effectively widening which should create wider profit margins got it okay and so putting that kind of altogether do you see ladder taking share this year in the conduit market or obviously you ve expressed a lot of caution and more volatility so just given kind of the trends you re seeing now how would you say volumes look like this year versus last year brian harris chief executive officer yeah volume is not a concern of ours its profitability that we search for so i would say i can only really look out a quarter i will tell you i like the conduit business right now i think we re going to do more of it now than we did in the past recently margin seem acceptable there seems to be good supply and demand going on their partners are easy to find bp s buyers are aggressive so there s plenty of reasons why i like that business and honestly in the next last two years this is probably as optimistic as i ve been on that business and that s probably the good part of when you see in 2016 we embarked on an aggressive campaign to add balance sheet loans that were libor based floaters onto our balance sheet adding and adding and adding in anticipation of the fed raising rates and they did exactly what we had hoped they would do today if you fear that they might go down in rates i think you have to think of the other side of that coin too if you like making those loans when libor was going up maybe the definition is slowing it down a little bit if you think they re going down is a concern especially in the late cycle so on a relative value basis last year i told you we loved real estate and we loved bridge loans i would tell you this year we like real estate we love the conduit business and we especially love securities during volatile times so that s the model at ladder right we rotate around the wheel on the products and we are we have moved and the reason i don t want to give you a volume estimate or participation estimate for a full year is we can turn on the dime and so it we can be buying securities and focusing on the conduit business for 90 days and then show up with 1 billion worth of bridge loans tim hayes fbr analyst that makes a lot of sense appreciate the comments around that and then just one more from me real estate operating expenses were down a decent amount quarter over quarter just wondering what accounted for the drop with the balance of the portfolio being relatively flat marc fox chief financial officer yeah that that had to do with the combination of things are the accounting that s surrounding our condominium investments as has changed with respect to the consolidation of the hoas that are involved and also what you see is also the aftermath of us selling the lafayette property last year tim hayes fbr analyst got it okay appreciate you guys taking my questions brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of rich shane with jp morgan please see with your question rich shane jp morgan analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions this afternoon i ll try to keep it quick look i think the you ve done a good job describing sort of the transition in terms of where you want to deploy capital i just want to make sure i understand the securities the transition toward securities two fold one is brian is it fair to say that when you looked at execution on the stuff you were selling you realized it was just simply a better time to be a buyer and that s that drives that inflection brian harris chief executive officer categorically no the execution was fine the only mistake we made was we didn t have enough of them however it s a very easy transaction to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a very short period of time while the whole world is a seller so we just took advantage of that reason because they were simply cheap i wouldn t say this was us not liking another investment it was really the it was more that the product called cusips got attractive it wasn t that the rest of the world got less attractive rich shane jp morgan analyst got it okay that s helpful and brian harris chief executive officer when i look at our products right now bridge loans real estate conduit and cusips i will tell you all of them are on i like every one of those products right now i think that the only expression you re hearing from me on the bridge loan portfolio is competition has heated up there s a lot of capital chasing it credit spreads are tightening into a market where they might maybe should be widening and i m a little concerned about that and if you think that libor is going to fall as opposed to rise you can exit that in one quarter you have to start thinking about that years in advance i don t want to signal to you that we re not originating bridge loans because i d suspect in the first quarter you ll see a resumption of our net add on the balance sheet portfolio because we re not experiencing a lot of payoffs but we are writing plenty of loans but we are a little more cautious in that area rich shane jp morgan analyst cusips are great and again you indicated that the conduit business you expect the conduit business to rebound in this in the first quarter brian harris chief executive officer i do rich shane jp morgan analyst i am curious so is the way to look at this the attractiveness of the securities was a function of being able to deploy capital into larger chunks more quickly and into diversified pools with short durations is that what made it compelling brian harris chief executive officer yes we don t there s much less insurance being paid to hedge interest rates on a short security there s less airplane time and analysis when you re buying aaas and all you had to really do was look at the inflows and outflows and you could see through redemptions that is one of the benefits of this cycle where there s a lot of passive investing what happens is you just see forced redemption going on it used to be hedge funds you would see a lot of volatility and you d make a few calls around town and find out what hedge fund was having a problem now it s an etf usually and so when we re buying a whole lot of clo types aaa bonds there s not that many people that own them so one of my originators said to me who s selling those things they look very cheap and i said it s the people that just bought them because they re only two years old and they said well why would they sell them and the answer is because they have to they re taking redemptions in their funds and so we really like moment like that anytime we see a volatility spike we take a look and we ask a very basic question is this a credit problem or is this a liquidity problem and that looked like a liquidity problem to us if we ever saw one rich shane jp morgan analyst so it was much more of a tactical call than the strategic call brian harris chief executive officer it was an opportunistic call yes rich shane jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jill o dwyer ph with ltc partners please proceed with your question jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst hey everybody good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions you raised capital to equity sales which of course stayed with management stake and you raised that for some opportunistic things that were out in the marketplace i m just wondering after you raise that capital and leverage it if you feel like you ve expanded at all now in terms of where you thought those opportunities were going to be brian harris chief executive officer we have a reasonable amount of dry powder we don t think that that december situation is necessarily over we take our cue from the inverted five year and two year as potentially problems ahead and some of the rhetoric coming out of washington right now so we think that there will be some other opportunities and we did raise that small amount of capital really as a hybrid almost as i mentioned in the original call that when i was talking about the quarter we thought rates were low and we borrowed fixed rate fundings from the federal home loan bank of over 280 million and but we originally started by simply buying securities to hold that so that there was no drag effect and no j curve on those funds that we had borrowed because it is secured borrowing but we borrowed the other 100 million for a few reasons one is we felt like we unpacked i think we even said it on the third quarter call that we thought we d be buying securities because we thought volatility would be increasing and we did not have to wait long until it happen have we expanded all of it well we took 700 million in payoffs also so the original plan of the 100 million that we borrowed coupled with the borrowings at the federal home loan bank yes we ve expanded that however with 730 million in payoffs on the bridge loan portfolio we have some cash around but we will it may take a quarter but i don t think it ll be too hard there s plenty of opportunities right now jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst okay thank you and then just curious in terms of playing off what you said in terms of kind of things are expensive there s a lot of capital available like technical difficulty our liquidity in the marketplace i was wondering how that s impacting to your thought process on net lease acquisitions and even more specifically and maybe what you re doing with the dollar general acquisitions and just kind of how that whole thought process is played into the way you re looking in that marketplace brian harris chief executive officer well the marketplace of net lease i think is a difficult place to say you re going to add a whole lot in right now and the main reason being your cost of funds has dramatically increased relative to where the cap rates are on many of those things that are selling you do have the amazon effect taking place in some of those retailers i would argue that rather than talking about the net lease space i d rather talk about the dollar general space and dollar general is one of our favorite companies right now and there s a lot of reasons why we prefer to buy dollar generals one is that there are hundreds of them and you can be rather selective around where you want to buy them two is that trying to word it delicately the dollar general customer is not necessarily the amazon prime customer so and they re oftentimes in less populated areas so less likely to be trafficked by the big retailers that are mostly shrinking as opposed to expanding into areas like that and another thing that we like to do is dollar general has been around for a long time and what the dollar general is doing is they re moving out of a lot of their inline stores and moving right across the street into stand alone source and we like that because we know that they know their customer so they wouldn t be making that move unless they understood they could support it and lastly there is a high barrier to entry to buying dollar generals because the average dollar general costs about 1 4 million so by the time you get through with appraisers and engineers and environmental and lawyers you can get through a pretty big legal bill on a 1 4 million asset so if we were buying one of them i wouldn t do it but when you buy 100 of them that s a very attractive proposition because you do get them at a slightly wider cap rate because of the expense factor that goes with it we don t absorb quite the expenses that other people do jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst right and i appreciate that and i feel the same way you do about dollar general for all those same reasons i ve looked at the dollar general portfolio pretty extensively and it s pretty wise just my last question is you saw a loan book run off and then the need to redeploy that capital i m just wondering if we enter an environment where despite what s happened in the first quarter where you hadn t really had a loan book run off but if we get into future quarters where you re having a loan book runoff just kind of wondering how you guys have thought about replacing that and if you say rotating into other areas if you feel like if and when the loan book runs off will you be able to rotate into these other areas to keep your core growth going brian harris chief executive officer well we think we will be able to but that doesn t mean we will be able to we don t determine those opportunities those are determined by the market but there s always other things we can do one we can give it back to our shareholders if we feel like it but if we re last year we developed during a year where cash was considered the best investment where bonds were down stocks were down we delivered a 14 9 roe when we re delivering an roe like that or even we tend to shoot for as we ve said many times 9 to 10 without anything fancy going on but if we can make a double digit return on equity and we can do that rather easily from what i can tell at this point anyway if it continues like this as long as we can do that we ll just keep investing and rotating around our product mix however if for some reason it got to the point where we didn t think we could deliver a return like that we would probably opt to start giving money back to shareholders rather than trying to fund loans that didn t cover our dividend jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst okay appreciate the conservatism you guys are bringing into the marketplace because we re not really seeing that in too many other areas operator our final question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks just wanted to ask your thoughts on the new york city condo market how much of a concern is the oversupply right now and the decline in demand do you anticipate it to result in distressed projects and could that be an opportunity for ladder brian harris chief executive officer that s an interesting question i don t know how it will be more negative on it than we are we are not comfortable with new york city condos as an investment right now it doesn t mean they won t become a very attractive investment in fact one thing that could change our mind very quickly is if the state and local tax deduction were restored and we think it might be or if it was even raised to 30 000 instead of 10 000 we think that that event alone has really caused a big problem in the space and that could be easily reversed so i don t know if i call that a market condition or a legal condition but it is problematic for sure and that s where i am very concerned i think about residential housing let s not talk about new york city condos let s talk about new york new jersey connecticut and california because i think that there are many factors at work right now in those states that would cause me to be very concerned about any form of positive view toward residential property values jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator this concludes our question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back over to

price these rounds were often held near the courthouse steps q4 update in november 2018 the doj announced that two more mississippi real estate investors pleaded guilty for their roles in a conspiracy to rig bids at public real estate foreclosure auctions in mississippi from as early as june 2011 through as least february 2017 bringing the total number of guilty pleas obtained by the doj in this

inheritance two companies and two executives agreed to split fees and to not contact the other s clients one company and its executive pleaded guilty while the other company and its executive proceeded to trial prior to trial the district court made two important holdings first the rule of reason would apply to the heir location agreement not the per se rule the court reasoned that per se treatment was inappropriate for an agreement structured in an unusual way that affected only a small number of estates in a relatively obscure industry the court added that the agreement may have contained efficiency enhancing potential second the court held that the statute of limitations barred prosecution the agreement ended in july 2008 and mere ministerial tasks like distributing payments did not extend the conspiracy beyond the agreement s stated termination date united states v kemp assocs inc no 16 cr 00403 d utah aug 28 2017 the government appealed both rulings to the tenth circuit court of appeals q4 update the tenth circuit reversed the district court s second ruling that the statute of limitations barred prosecution but found that it lacked jurisdiction to review the district court s rule of reason decision however the appeals court suggested that the district court might want to revisit its rule of reason order on remand since additional briefing at the appellate stage added important information that might be helpful in determining whether the rule of reason or the per se rule applied united states v kemp assocs inc 907 f 3d 1264 10th cir 2018 on remand the government has asked the district court for a hearing on whether it should revisit its rule of reason decision which the defendant opposed the district court has yet to rule on the government s

claimed that the conspirators met at several locations in honduras and the united states and conspired to raise prices charged to u s customers through commissions in port cities throughout the us according to the doj s filings the two executives also instructed their co conspirators not to leave a document trail for fear of us antitrust liability q4 update the two executives have since pleaded guilty to the doj s charges and have agreed to cooperate with its investigation the owner could face a sentence between 18 and 24 months and the manager 12 to 21 months sentencing is set for february 2019 in the southern district of florida united states v dip et al no 18 cr 20877 s d fla no poach agreements in 2016 the ftc and doj released joint guidance arguing that anti poaching agreements are per se illegal such no poach or no hire clauses in employment contracts prohibit companies from soliciting one another s employees the guidance also stated that certain no poach agreements that are ancillary to otherwise pro competitive conduct will be subject to a quick look or rule of reason level of scrutiny while the recent activity has been confined to the franchise setting there is no reason to believe it will remain so confined in early 2018 doj assistant attorney general makan delrahim stated that the doj will criminally investigate and prosecute so called no poach agreements the doj brought its first case since the policy was announced reaching a civil settlement with two firms knorr bremse ag and westinghouse air brake technologies corp for allegedly agreeing not to recruit and hire each other s employees in announcing the settlement doj specified that it was handled civilly rather than criminally only because the conduct ceased when the guidance was announced in 2016 since then eleven state attorneys general for california illinois massachusetts maryland minnesota new jersey new york oregon pennsylvania rhode island and washington have initiated antitrust investigations into the use of no poach agreements by franchise based fast food operations in their states the washington attorney general has led the charge after initiating its investigation the washington ag obtained agreements from 30 nationwide chains to eliminate the practices of including no poach clauses in their franchise contracts while the washington ag s investigation first focused on fast food chains its investigation has since expanded to other industries including hotels car repair gyms home health care convenience stores cleaning tax preparation parcel electronics repair child care custom window covering travel and insurance adjuster services according to the washington ag only two nationwide fast food chains in washington continue to use no poach clauses in their franchise agreements both of which are sandwich chains and one of which the ag filed a formal complaint against in october 2018 several civil class actions have since been filed by employees of certain franchise based companies that have come under scrutiny q4 update in three civil suits in the eastern district of washington the doj filed motions to inform the court of the doj s view as to what standard the court should apply to individual no poach agreements per se or rule of reason the doj maintains its view that strictly horizontal no poach agreements between competitors should be governed by the per se rule however it argued to the court that vertical no poach agreements between franchisors and franchisees that limit competing franchisees from hiring the others employees should be governed by the rule of reason those agreements are vertical in one sense and horizontal in another but they are reasonably related to a legitimate business goal the district judge overseeing the cases in which the doj intervened has rescheduled hearings on defendants motions to dismiss for march 2019 so as to allow the doj additional time to formally express its view over the relevant standards of scrutiny to apply in the civil suits polyurethane industry in its july 2018 complaint against seven chemical companies over supply restrictions of polyurethane products a foam maker stated that in february 2018 the doj s antitrust division caused a federal grand jury to issue subpoenas to manufacturers of polyurethane products methylene diphenyl diisocyanate mdi and toluene diisocyanate tdi the doj has not formally announced an investigation into the polyurethane industry but one defendant in the foam maker s complaint confirmed that it had been contacted by the doj in relation to an investigation in the polyurethane industry any doj investigation in the polyurethane industry would be separate from its 2006 investigation into sales of tdi mdi and polyether polyols products that concluded in 2007 without any charges promotional products these cases relate to an investigation over price fixing of customized promotional products such as wristbands and lanyards sold online two companies and two executives have pleaded guilty and the companies have been ordered to pay nearly 2 5 million dollars in criminal fines the doj alleged that the individuals met in person and used encrypted messaging apps to reach and implement the price fixing agreements q4 update in november 2018 the doj announced new charges against another online promotional products company and its executive for conspiring to fix prices for customized promotional products including wristbands lanyards temporary tattoos and buttons between may 2014 and june 2016 fuel supply contracts new

refinery companies conspired to suppress competition during the bidding process for us government fuel supply contracts three south korea based companies have agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay approximately 82 million in criminal fines and have agreed to pay 154 million in civil fines relating to the antitrust and false claims act violations these guilty pleas are the first

july 12 2018 the general court of the eu upheld a decision of the commission imposing a fine on an investment bank for its indirect subsidiary s participation in the power cables cartel in its decision of april 2 2014 the commission applied its case law according to which a parent company that exercises decisive influence over a subsidiary can be found liable for the competition law infringements of that subsidiary more specifically the commission applied its parental liability presumption according to which a parent company is presumed to exercise such decisive influence when it wholly owns its subsidiary or holds almost all of the shares of its subsidiary the investment bank appealed the commission s decision arguing that it held less than 91 of the shares of the subsidiary that had participated in the cartel the general court rejected this argument and held that the parental liability presumption can be applied even if the parent company holds less than 100 of the shares of its subsidiary but is able to exercise all the voting rights in the subsidiary the investment bank has appealed the general court s ruling to the european court of justice car emissions on

business news of thursday 28 february 2019 source thebftonline com a report by the bank of ghana that assesses the impact of external shocks on ghana s economy has revealed the cedi s depreciation against the us is expected to continue throughout the year as global events show more external threats ahead the report titled the effect of external conditions on the economy of ghana is authored by philip abradu otoo and bernard jagre walley of the bog s research department it says an expected slowdown in the u s and chinese economies alongside policy rate hikes in the u s strengthening of the us and higher crude oil prices will all impact ghana s economy negatively leading to a significant deterioration in the exchange rate the slow down of the world s two biggest economies will dampen growth in emerging and developing economies including ghana which will result in capital outflows whereas policy rate hikes in the us will attract investors also triggering capital outflows from ghana to the u s and resulting in high demand for the dollar while a surge in oil prices will although stabilizing growth further increase inflation which will also culminate in a sharp depreciation of the cedi the results show that a simultaneous slowdown in the world s two largest economies will dampen gdp growth in ghana induce a significant deterioration in the exchange rate and induce a marginal increase in the domestic inflation rate and a sharp rise in interest rates it further says a surge in oil prices leads to a relatively stable gdp growth inflation declines initially but picks up marginally after three quarters while the exchange rate depreciates sharply the report states commenting on the report financial analyst dr richmond atuahene told the b ft that the local currency s future looks gloomy if you look at the currency depreciation it doesn t look good it may depreciate more than 15 percent this year and once the interest rate in america goes up people will disinvest their bonds and rather go and invest in the u s and this will definitely put pressure on the cedi so all the report is saying is that it doesn t look good from the currency point of view he said the report further shows that about 40 percent of the variation in ghana s real gdp growth is accounted for by external influences what this essentially means is that any activity be it positive or negative which happens with ghana s trading partner countries can affect economic growth by 40 percent an economist at the university of cape coast professor john gatsi said this shows how integrated the country s economy is with other economies and should not be a cause for worry when situations are favorable the activities in those economies will help you also develop because when they are doing well they will invest in other countries but when something negative is happening to them it will affect you for example we are supposed to receive some us 2 billion from china if the economic situation does not support their ability to give you that us 2 billion it will not come so it is explaining our linkage with some economies he said the report recommends that policymakers should implement measures that can absorb some of the external shocks to mitigate their effect on the local economy the results thus imply that external factors play an important role in the ghanaian economy domestic fundamentals may either act to amplify or dampen the impact of these external developments on the ghanaian economy policymakers should therefore continue to improve the macro fundamentals to dampen the effects of external shocks on the ghanaian economy it proposes measures like fiscal discipline reduction in external debt building forex buffers continuing with the ongoing disinflation process and appropriate monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy in the long term promoting exports would help to reduce the pressure on the cedi the report states

comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap are contained in our earnings release with that i ll turn the call over to our chief executive officer brian harris brian harris chief executive officer thank you michelle today i ll walk through some earnings data for the fourth quarter as well as the full year 2018 results i ll then note some interesting changes in investment preferences that took place in the fourth quarter and how we see the year ahead shaping up in the fourth quarter ladder produce core earnings a non gaap measure of 52 5 million or 0 45 per share this resulted in an after tax core return on average equity of 12 9 for the full year 2018 we had core earnings of 230 1 million or 2 03 per share and after tax core return on average equity of 14 9 we are particularly pleased with our performance this year as core earnings per share increased by 31 8 versus 2017 our undepreciated book value increased by 5 1 during the year to 15 34 per share after announcing two increases to our quarterly cash dividend during the year our multi product model served us well in 2018 as our real estate portfolio accounted for 24 of net investment income while our balance sheet loan inventory contributed to another 61 of net investment income to core earnings you may recall that in our last earnings call we voiced some concerns about general market complacency an overly hawkish federal reserve bank chairman and our view that volatility was likely to pick up as we progress into year end the volatility witnessed in december 2018 was expected and produced an excellent opportunity to make high quality investments in securities as ramp in redemption caused the forced selling of many very safe liquid securities particularly clos and short duration cmbs as we are prone to do during periods of high volatility we purchased a relatively large amount of securities in the quarter totaling 468 3 million we purchased these assets at a discount to par and they have a weighted average maturity of less than three years we match funded many of these purchases by borrowing 288 million in the federal home loan bank at an average fixed rate of 2 89 with an average maturity of two years we ve continued to purchase securities into the first quarter of 2019 adding an additional 187 million over the first two months thus far this year while we are acquiring securities we are also witnessing compression of credit spreads in our balance sheet lending business further shifting our focus away from loan origination and toward securities acquisition during the fourth quarter we received loan payoffs in our bridge loan portfolio of 730 9 million roughly three times what we would normally expect in a quarter while we could have held onto many of these loans by simply matching the terms of the refinancing lender the terms being offered usually with higher proceeds at lower rates didn t seem to offer the right risk reward relationship so we collected are pay off with our exit fees and reallocated our capital into what we felt was a better value proposition for our shareholders we did originate 237 9 million in balance sheet loans in the quarter with a weighted average interest rate of 7 75 and we also originated 182 million of first mortgage loans held for securitization during the fourth quarter we also participated in three securitizations all completed before the volatility in december we contributed 364 8 million of loan earning 7 million i m pleased to report that we have also contributed 170 million of loans to a securitization in the first quarter of 2019 however that securitization has not settled yet we ve seen a slowdown in the pace of repayments of our balance sheet loans receiving just 55 million in pay offs at this point in the quarter this is probably the result of the widening of credit spreads in the clo market and the volatility seen in world markets in december while we embarked on an aggressive plan in 2016 to originate more floating rate bridge loans anticipating higher rates after building upon our loan inventory quarter after quarter the fourth quarter of 2018 marked the first time in over two years that our inventory of balance sheet loans fell quarter over quarter at the end of 2018 we still own 3 3 billion of balance sheet loans but for the first time in years our inventory of securities increased by 44 in the quarter ending the year at 1 41 billion this illustrates how flexible and nimble our investment platform is able to pivot quickly into different product types as changing market conditions produce different investment opportunities as we move ahead into 2019 i would like to note that while we seem to have witnessed the v shape recovery from december 2018 into february of 2019 interest rates still have not returned to where they were in november of 2018 the yield on the 10 year u s treasury is still about 50 basis points lower than it was in november while many may chalk that up to more recent fed commentary that expresses patience when raising interest rates we would also note that the two year rate is inverted against the five year treasury rate and the yield curve is still quite flat and this makes us more cautious about what we think lies ahead in the u s economy we continue to be somewhat concerned about slowing global economy trade wars with china emerging talk of future tax policies that don t seem to support growth a possible hard brexit and growing tensions with russia and while we feel that the economy is stable we think real estate valuations and by extension cash flows may have peaked we will be taking a slightly more cautious approach to lending on transitional loans that require execution and timing in a slowing economy we don t think we ve seen the last of the volatility witnessed in december and we will try to position ourselves to exploit investment opportunities that invariably present themselves when liquidity is thin and sellers are forced to sell high quality assets can meet redemption demands that tend to occur during periods of liquidity i ll wrap up now by saying how happy i am with the performance of 2018 of the company i d like to thank our employees and our investors who supported us throughout the year we look forward to 2019 confident that we re well positioned for the year ahead i ll now turn you over to mark fox marc fox chief financial officer thank you brian i will now review ladder capital s financial results for the quarter and year ended december 31 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder generated core earnings of 52 5 million resulting a core eps of 0 45 and an after tax return on average equity of 12 9 the 2018 calendar year core earnings totaled 230 1 million compared to 178 8 million for the year ended 12 31 17 2018 core eps was 2 2 03 per share compared to 1 54 per share earned in 2017 after tax roae for 2018 of 14 9 surpassed 2017 performance of 11 5 ladder s net interest income from loans and securities investments and net rental income from real estate investments totaled 226 9 million in 2018 and was about 25 higher than the 181 million earned in 2017 increases in recurring sources of income have been an ongoing trend since ladder s ipo in 2014 has allowed us to judiciously increased our quarterly cash dividend rate six times over the course of four years most recently in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a gaap basis ladder generated net income of ladder taxes of 27 8 million in the fourth quarter and 228 3 million for the year ended 12 31 18 the the largest gaap to core earnings adjustment in the fourth quarter related to the timing of the recognition of hedge results to coincide with the realization of gains and losses on a disposition of hedged assets in the fourth quarter ladder originated a total of 419 9 million of loans bringing total loan originations to 2 8 billion ladder s balance sheet loan originations exceeded conduit loan originations in 2018 for the first time since inception at the end of 2018 balance sheet loans totaled 3 3 billion in the conduit loan balance stood at 182 4 million also during the fourth quarter ladder reported income from pre securitization transactions to which ladder contributed 364 8 million principal balance of loans held for sale generating 7 million of securitization gains for the 2018 calendar year ladder securitize a total of 103 loans with a total principal balance of 1 3 billion in nine securitization transactions generating a total of 30 million of securitization gains finally during the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder made 7 2 million of net leased and other equity investments resulting in total net leased and other equity investments of 122 7 million in 2018 ladder also received 5 5 million of net proceeds from sales of condominium real estate in the fourth quarter bringing total proceeds from the sales of real estate to 218 7 million for the year turning to key balance sheet and investment activity metrics as of december 31 2018 96 of our debt investments were senior secured including first mortgage loans and commercial mortgage backed securities secured by first mortgage loans which is consistent with the senior secured focus of the company senior secured assets plus cash comprised 76 3 of our total asset base total assets stood at 6 27 billion which is 4 1 higher than at the end of 2017 total unencumbered investments including cash with 2 1 billion at year end and unsecured debt outstanding stood at 1 2 billion reflecting an unencumbered asset to unsecured debt ratio of 1 79 times the weighted average loan to value ratio of the commercial real estate loans on our balance sheet at the december 31 2018 with approximately 68 inline with prior quarters the most meaningful fourth quarter changes to the asset side of the balance sheet were in the securities and balance sheet loan portfolios during the fourth quarter the securities portfolio increased by 431 8 million instead of 1 41 billion at year end ladder responded to the spread widening and general volatility in the fixed income market by purchasing more securities in three months than the company had acquired in the preceding year at the end of the year the key risk metrics of this portfolio remains in line with historic norms as 80 9 of the securities portfolio was comprised of securities rated aaa or backed by a u s government agency and the weighted average duration was 29 months which compares to 30 months at 9 30 18 and 36 months a year prior also during the quarter ladder received 730 9 million of balance sheet loan repayments more than offsetting 237 9 million of balance sheet loan originations during the quarter the net result was a 3 3 billion december 31 2018 balance sheet loan portfolio versus a 3 8 billion portfolio at the end of the prior quarter the weighted average spread to libor and the floating rate loans in the portfolio was 556 basis points at year end compared to 563 basis points at 9 30 18 on the financing side as of 12 31 18 latter had 3 9 billion of adjusted debt outstanding and committed financing availability of 2 6 billion for additional investments at december 31 2018 debt was comprised of 1 17 billion of unsecured bond debt outstanding maturing in 2021 2022 and 2025 743 9 million of long term non recourse mortgage debt financing our real estate holdings and 601 5 million of non recourse clo debt when combined with 1 64 billion of permanent equity and 176 7 million of other liabilities 4 3 billion or 69 of ladder s capital base is comprised of equity unsecured debt and non recourse non mark to market debt at quarter end we had 1 3 billion of fhlb borrowings with a 2 46 year weighted average maturity and an average cost of 2 55 towards the end of the year ladder further diversified its funding sources entering into a new financing agreement with another major bank that is new to ladder to finance both first mortgage and mezzanine loans this new facility provides 100 million of committed availability and this agreement expands our access to loan repurchase financing to a fixed bank in november ladder also successfully accessed the equity market for the first time since our 2014 ipo we issued 5 8 million shares of class a common stock in an underwritten primary public offering resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately 100 million the shares were issued at a price reflecting a 24 premium over a gaap book value and a 12 premium over undepreciated book value ladder s year end undepreciated book value was 15 34 per share up from 15 25 at 9 30 and up from 14 60 at the end of 2017 finally in the fourth quarter ladder paid a 0 57 per share dividend including 0 34 in cash and 0 23 in shares of class a common stock the 0 34 per share cash dividend reflected a 4 increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate the sixth increase in four years dividends in 2018 totaled 1 535 per share of class a common stock with a cash dividend payout ratio of 64 3 ladder s equity base grew to 1 64 billion at year end reflecting an increase of 155 5 million or 10 in 2018 which resulted from strong 2018 performance in the form of 230 1 million of core earnings the 100 million of primary equity issuance in november ladder s continued adherence to a conservative dividend payout ratio supported by a base of growing recurring earnings and the election to pay a 0 23 per share portion of the 2018 dividend in stock instead of cash thus retaining approximately 25 million of equity in the meantime our asset base increased by 4 1 resulting in 2018 year end adjusted leverage of 2 34 times the lowest leverage level since 2014 the result of all this is that ladder entered to 2019 with over 500 million of available liquidity that can be used to take advantage of the opportunities cited when we issued equity in november applying modest leverage to those available funding could result in a 1 billion to 1 5 billion of additional investment assets on ladder s balance sheet over time so summing up in the fourth quarter of 2018 ladder generated 52 5 million of core earnings 0 45 per share of core eps resulting in a core after tax roe of 12 9 bringing 2018 core earnings to 230 1 million or 2 03 per share of core eps we originated 419 9 million of loans and securitized 364 8 million of fixed rate loans resulting in 7 million of net securitization gains we issued 5 8 million shares of class a common stock and our first underwritten primary public offering since the 2014 ipo resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately 100 million and we paid 0 57 per share dividend bringing total 2018 dividend to 1 535 per share of class a common stock in 2018 at this point it s time to open the line for questions and answers questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven delaney with jmp securities please shoot your question steven delaney jmp securities analyst hey good evening everybody thanks for taking my questions obviously a great report one thing you missed though you didn t say anything about your stock being up 35 since the end of 2017 and that was sort of at the top of my list so congrats on that seriously the other thing you didn t talk about is any recent real estate investments recently had the chance to be with one of your peers who also like you makes opportunistic investments and they were really talking down the ability to put any capital to work this year just because of higher prices and brian i appreciate your outlook on that as far as whether you obviously told us what you think about cmbs but i was just curious if you think you ll still be able to find any special sets because the real estate investment has really created a lot of value over the last couple of years thanks brian harris chief executive officer sure thanks steve and thanks for pointing out our recent success i hope that s not the curse of the announcer but i would say that we are not active in the real estate space for acquisitions in the quarter we haven t been terribly active in the first quarter either and that s not really our core business as you know we re always steven delaney jmp securities analyst oh sure brian harris chief executive officer have fielders out i mean we think that there will be some opportunities but i think the answer to the question is twofold one i think things are very expensive and there s a lot of capital around and two i think that we re probably a little more picky given our view of the economy over the next couple of years and it isn t that we think it s going to be bad necessarily we just don t think it s going to be better so we think that you would have to make a real estate investment today based on cash flows today rather than managing better or raising rents later on so we think the opportunity set for real estate as an asset class is not as strong today however steven delaney jmp securities analyst okay brian harris chief executive officer owning real estate through the debt door in the next couple of years might be a much more interesting proposition steven delaney jmp securities analyst got it and you commented on the loan spreads and being tighter almost sounds like to me even the cmbs spreads have come back and clos everything seems to be somewhat back to normal i mean we ve seen your execution on your cmbs you did with wells last week it almost seems though that securities might continue to be a bigger percentage this year just curious if you would care to comment on that and we had the volatility in 4q but it almost sounds like on a relative basis we could see you continue to grow that book brian harris chief executive officer i think that s accurate i can tell you that december you have to be moving quickly to take advantage of opportunities like that and thankfully we were able to do that we had plenty of dry powder and i think that has continued into january and february i think that we ve purchased another 190 million worth of securities in january and february to date so that would probably get us up to around kind of close to 600 million in the last four months or five months that s a lot for us so we are buying things on the short end mainly because we don t want to be hedging interest rates with all of the cash flow and with the flat yield curve that gets a little bit difficult so you want to be in the two year area two and three year and that s where we ve concentrated our efforts i would say though there if you took a look at almost any financial instrument it was really a v shape recovery right went down in december and then right back up into february but there are a couple of selling differences i don t think the clo market has come back all the way and the reason for that is i think the clo market is it s not broadly distributed the clo steven delaney jmp securities analyst right brian harris chief executive officer paper is really in the hands of a few money managers that are capable of understanding what goes into those things and frankly i think it s a very attractive buy but it was bid pretty tightly i would say into june and july of last year where i thought it was a little too aggressive so we do like that right now we are active purchases of clo aaa aa paper we think it s relatively cheap especially when compared to making libor based loans at relatively tight spreads late in the cycle and so we ll continue to do that as long as that opportunity presents itself and as far as the rest of the business just feels ok we are originating loans maybe not at the pace we are originating at when we felt a little more comfortable with where we were in the cycle but there s still plenty of opportunities i think one of the reasons we allocated some capital to securities it was just a better value trade but i also think that we are a little cautious about lending money to people now at higher loan amounts that at tighter spreads and attempting to get paid back in two to three years where we might be in a bit of a downturn so we are very selective right now about who we re lending money to and we re very selective about what rates we ll charge to lend that money out to people and it does seem like many of our competitors and peers are a little bit more aggressive in the space than we are i owe that to the flexibility of our model where we can easily shift over to securitization and the conduit business as well as mine securities so if we can buy the aaa paper from clo of a competitor at 130 and 140 dm which we were doing in december that looks like a better value proposition than libor plus 300 on loans steven delaney jmp securities analyst understood appreciate the comments brian brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please suit your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much brian i wanted to ask if you could share your thoughts on the co working business model it seems to have taking the leasing market by storm and accounts for as much as i don t know something like a third of leasing activity if you look at the commercial real estate brokers the reporting leasing volumes growth of north of 20 year on year and it s clear that the office sector for traditional occupiers is not growing lease occupancy at that rate so wanted to find out what do you think about that brian harris chief executive officer sure i m not an expert on it first of all but it s clearly the the hotelification of the office buildings taking place and i do agree that a lot of office tenants are not renewing nearly the sizes and space that they used to so there you do have to adapt and i do think that especially for new companies it s a very attractive feature because you don t have all of the you have assistance really in moving into these companies so that makes sense and i think the idea behind the weworks of the world and names like that is you put 10 accounts into a building you really hope two or three of them expand greatly and stay in the building i don t know if that s their business plan but that s what i think they re doing but i as far as a lender i am always cautious when you see space in a headline being leaded by a company that s new and oftentimes not making money that always concerns me a little bit so you have to dig into the financials of that company and to see who s guaranteeing that lease but they re signing because effectively what they re doing is they re mass releasing real estate and that s fine if it s a strong in our company but if it s an llc that just has nothing but that space and the cash flows associated with it i would be very cautious around relying too heavily on that but as a business model and as the as technology makes some real estate obsolete and other real estate more portable i think it s fine idea like most good idea as they get a little overdone and i would suspect that when the largest tenants in a city like new york is a temporary space seller to smaller companies i would flash caution at that jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks for that can you give an update on both credit and migration in the quarter it didn t look like there s any notable change in the loss provision so assume credit was stable in the quarter but also on the couple of credit issues you ve experienced what the status update is on those loans brian harris chief executive officer i would say credit any credit problems bubbling up are very similar to the ones that we ve seen before i think credit problems are occurring in particular in operating businesses like hotels and also in non cash flowing businesses that are being repositioned so if you have a construction loan outstanding and there is no cash flow let s say i don t know call it a 100 million loan and if it s out there at a given rate if you need another year that s a very expensive proposition because you have to put up a full year of interest reserves and when you ve got libor at 2 5 instead of 50 where it was few 2 5 years ago that s quite a bit more but as i said i think it s mostly biting into the equity roes at this point and not necessarily causing debt problems having said that i do think that limited service hotels are probably overbuilt i think that the hotel business as a whole is doing fine but i do think it is there are reminders out there that operating businesses are not all real estate so during the quarter in the fourth quarter we actually did have a situation on some hotels in texas that we thought we were going to foreclose on and we began to make moves in that direction however also due to the fact that there is a lot of capital in the world right now and texas is doing very well we did get paid off in full before and ultimately turned it in from that happened that went round tripping in the fourth quarter that became a conversation became a difficult conversation and then it became a pay off in the beginning of december so i would say credit s stable but showing signs of distress on anything that needs to be extended where the borrower is not particularly well capitalized the other situations we ve had as you know we have an office building that we re now part of reserve in wilmington delaware and not much change there it s been a little bit too soon i think given the way we restructured that whole capital stack and the other one was a food emporium on broadway here in manhattan that is in bankruptcy still it is still 100 occupied by bed bath beyond credit for a long term lease i don t understand why it s in bankruptcy but it is still but it is not of a particular concern to us we re under receivership we re receiving cash flow payments and we re just really waiting for that to sort itself out through the bankruptcy system jade rahmani kbw analyst you mentioned securities purchases to date and you mentioned loan repayments to date what about bridge loan and conduit originations in the first quarter thus far brian harris chief executive officer let me take a quick i ve got a pretty good idea of that do you have it pamela pamela mccormack president yeah marc fox chief financial officer yeah pamela mccormack president right now we look on pace more toward on average kind of growth i would say we re expecting to do 500 million to 650 million broken roughly 50 50 maybe a slightly heavier balance toward balance sheet but i think you can see you can expect to see a more regular quarter from us brian harris chief executive officer and i would tell you so far in the first two months we have closed i don t have the breakout between bridge and conduit but we have closed 334 million worth of loan so far marc fox chief financial officer 190 million were balance sheet loans jade rahmani kbw analyst okay thanks for taking the questions brian harris chief executive officer no problem at all operator our next question comes from the line of stephen laws with raymond james please proceed with your question stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions following it up on the last answer was to jade s question can you maybe talk a little bit about the differences and how you think about the underwriting are the volumes for the loans that you plan to put into the conduit versus those you put it to the on to the balance sheet and i guess maybe start with that brian harris chief executive officer same underwriting process there is no difference same people here underwrite both categories and obviously one of them has more cash flow than others so one of them you might have there have a little bit better predictive ability as opposed to this fully stabilized assets that go into the conduit but again the conduit model you re really underwriting in for rating agency guideline and kind of there is a little bit of variation around it but not that much whereas the balance sheet business you can t overlook certain things that maybe a rating agency wouldn t or you can also decide to penalize an item more then a rating agency would so we re cautious on all of our loans and we use the same process but i would tell you that today as opposed to a couple of years ago in the bridge loan business we are not underwriting the expectation of higher cash flows over the next 12 to 24 months we re underwriting stability and if not possibly down cash flows so we don t necessarily things are going think things are going to get better and then a transitional loan i think we have to live in a world where first of all interest rates might go up and we think they won t but they might and if they do that libor cap only helps until you get to the maturity date and then it has to be refinanced so you have to think a little bit more there is a lot more liquidity in the world so you can take a little bit more risk i think in the execution because if a borrower does execute 75 of its business plan he can probably refinance you even though he hasn t got all the cash flow straightened out but if that liquidity dries up on the refinance pipeline then you d have to be you re in an extension conversation where you re going to ask a bar to write a check with additional equity given 730 million in pay offs in the fourth quarter and i ll tell you december didn t get a lot of pay offs because it was such a volatile quarter so that was a hell of a lot of payoffs in that quarter relative to our existence to date having said that i think december put a real holding that clo model because spreads did widen out quite a bit and as a result of that and as i said we re only we ve only received 55 million in pay offs so far in the first quarter so i wouldn t draw too much conclusion from any one quarter but we are underwriting cautiously going forward on bridge loans as well as conduit loans stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst great thanks for the color on that brian and switching gears to the cmbs side how big we do envision that portfolio getting i mean if the environment stays like it is or was for january and february we continued to add it to add it to the cmbs baskets will that reached 2 billion in cmbs will it go higher kind of you how do you think about your portfolio mix moving through the year given the current market environment brian harris chief executive officer well i try not to put a calendar into the answer i would tell you our desire to do our next transaction oftentimes leads to securities during periods of high volatility and we happen to see that in december i think we ll see it again but i don t quote me on this marc you might be able to help i believe we had a cmbs portfolio of over 3 billion at one point marc fox chief financial officer yeah we were approaching 3 billion yes brian harris chief executive officer so to me again when you make a loan you really own the aaa the aa the singe a and bbb and everything else that goes into a normal securitization so it isn t i don t differentiate too much between loans and securities what securities do is they provide you with a degree of safety and the degree of liquidity and so when you can buy very short term high quality assets that are easily financed easily sold and they produce levered returns in the 8 to 9 area that might very well be a better short term investments than making loans that yield an 11 levered because those loans are not that liquid and so we always sometimes it may not be intuitive but we might take a little bit less in yield to live a little bit more safely so your question is do we see it get to the 2 billion i don t see it getting to 2 billion unless there is another few bouts of volatility but if there was a 60 day about of volatility and still you had to do is watch your tv today and you realize there s plenty of things that can cause that that number could go to 3 billion stephen laws raymond james associates inc analyst great appreciate the color on that brian and marc thank you very much brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of tim hayes with fbr please proceed with your question tim hayes fbr analyst hey good evening everyone brian i appreciate your comments on credit quality earlier but i just wanted to pick on credit a little bit more directly do you anticipate a pickup in provisions and or losses in your portfolio this year and how does the fed commentary or your view of rates play into this view brian harris chief executive officer i m sorry jim i didn t hear that can you repeat that tim hayes fbr analyst yeah sure no i was just just got to wanted to pick on credit a little bit more directly just wondering if you expect provisions to increase this year and or losses in the portfolio and then just maybe how your view around with plays into that brian harris chief executive officer i think that there will be more stress again i personally think the fed s next move is down not up i know that s an unusual comment but it isn t because i see anything in particular that s problematic in our portfolio i see things in the economy that are problematic and again i think that there maybe just a little bit too much liquidity right now chasing too few transactions so there might be a little bit of over leveraging of a principal column construction loans is typically something that might get into trouble but excuse me those don t hop and show up until a couple years go by because they have interest reserves right now so i would say answer the question by saying i don t think that we ll see less difficulty in our portfolio or real estate in general but i don t think we re going to see any unusual increases in it either so if there the loan underwritings that have been done over the last few years they re reasonably sane there is a reasonable equity in these transactions so i think that you could easily see some maturity defaults or some restructuring without necessarily seeing a loss associated with it tim hayes fbr analyst understood appreciate the comments there and then the gain on sale margin on the conduit transactions in 4q was pretty low compared to historical levels and just wondering directionally if you d expect the margin to improve on the 1q 19 transaction and to be more in line with historical levels okay the first securitization we did i can t get into too much detail because it hasn t settled however i can tell you that in the fourth quarter and i ll go back even till june from june of 2018 through december credit spreads widened almost every month so every securitization we did in the second half of the year we may have made money we did make money on all of them and we are they were profitable but they were not as profitable as we had hoped they would be and i think we made around that 1 9 in the fourth quarter and we were in three securitizations and all three of them in my opinion didn t do very well but again that s why you build in a bigger margin because you can absorb some spread widening while you re out there in the market going into the first quarter we do see flows of funds and they re in the 7 to 10 year intermediate bond area there s a lot of flows going into those funds so that tells me that a lot of investors are not afraid of the fed raising rates and they re not afraid to buy longer paper even though there s a flat yield curve in addition to that the insurance companies with their fresh allocations have arrived in january they generally like to get through their allocations before the summer and so this is a seasonally aggressive period for lenders there s a lot of competition in the first and second quarters tends to lighten up a a little bit in the second half of the year really after july 4th so it s a little hard for me to say what i think profit margins will be i do think that there is a lack of supply loan demand is not terribly strong but i do think that that flat yield curve fear has left the market at least for the near term so and i ll also give you a little factoid in that these january the securitization we did in 2019 obviously was loans that were closed before 19 interest rates on the 10 year fell dramatically and they have not returned to where they were so the 10 year interest rate on u s treasury is about 10 50 basis points lower today than it was back in november and so when loan when rates fall dramatically like that that s usually good for us even though it does invite more competition but that would be in a high loan demand market which december was not but on the other hand we have floors in our loans and when you have floors in your loans as you re closing them your spreads are effectively widening which should create wider profit margins got it okay and so putting that kind of altogether do you see ladder taking share this year in the conduit market or obviously you ve expressed a lot of caution and more volatility so just given kind of the trends you re seeing now how would you say volumes look like this year versus last year brian harris chief executive officer yeah volume is not a concern of ours its profitability that we search for so i would say i can only really look out a quarter i will tell you i like the conduit business right now i think we re going to do more of it now than we did in the past recently margin seem acceptable there seems to be good supply and demand going on their partners are easy to find bp s buyers are aggressive so there s plenty of reasons why i like that business and honestly in the next last two years this is probably as optimistic as i ve been on that business and that s probably the good part of when you see in 2016 we embarked on an aggressive campaign to add balance sheet loans that were libor based floaters onto our balance sheet adding and adding and adding in anticipation of the fed raising rates and they did exactly what we had hoped they would do today if you fear that they might go down in rates i think you have to think of the other side of that coin too if you like making those loans when libor was going up maybe the definition is slowing it down a little bit if you think they re going down is a concern especially in the late cycle so on a relative value basis last year i told you we loved real estate and we loved bridge loans i would tell you this year we like real estate we love the conduit business and we especially love securities during volatile times so that s the model at ladder right we rotate around the wheel on the products and we are we have moved and the reason i don t want to give you a volume estimate or participation estimate for a full year is we can turn on the dime and so it we can be buying securities and focusing on the conduit business for 90 days and then show up with 1 billion worth of bridge loans tim hayes fbr analyst that makes a lot of sense appreciate the comments around that and then just one more from me real estate operating expenses were down a decent amount quarter over quarter just wondering what accounted for the drop with the balance of the portfolio being relatively flat marc fox chief financial officer yeah that that had to do with the combination of things are the accounting that s surrounding our condominium investments as has changed with respect to the consolidation of the hoas that are involved and also what you see is also the aftermath of us selling the lafayette property last year tim hayes fbr analyst got it okay appreciate you guys taking my questions brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of rich shane with jp morgan please see with your question rich shane jp morgan analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions this afternoon i ll try to keep it quick look i think the you ve done a good job describing sort of the transition in terms of where you want to deploy capital i just want to make sure i understand the securities the transition toward securities two fold one is brian is it fair to say that when you looked at execution on the stuff you were selling you realized it was just simply a better time to be a buyer and that s that drives that inflection brian harris chief executive officer categorically no the execution was fine the only mistake we made was we didn t have enough of them however it s a very easy transaction to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a very short period of time while the whole world is a seller so we just took advantage of that reason because they were simply cheap i wouldn t say this was us not liking another investment it was really the it was more that the product called cusips got attractive it wasn t that the rest of the world got less attractive rich shane jp morgan analyst got it okay that s helpful and brian harris chief executive officer when i look at our products right now bridge loans real estate conduit and cusips i will tell you all of them are on i like every one of those products right now i think that the only expression you re hearing from me on the bridge loan portfolio is competition has heated up there s a lot of capital chasing it credit spreads are tightening into a market where they might maybe should be widening and i m a little concerned about that and if you think that libor is going to fall as opposed to rise you can exit that in one quarter you have to start thinking about that years in advance i don t want to signal to you that we re not originating bridge loans because i d suspect in the first quarter you ll see a resumption of our net add on the balance sheet portfolio because we re not experiencing a lot of payoffs but we are writing plenty of loans but we are a little more cautious in that area rich shane jp morgan analyst cusips are great and again you indicated that the conduit business you expect the conduit business to rebound in this in the first quarter brian harris chief executive officer i do rich shane jp morgan analyst i am curious so is the way to look at this the attractiveness of the securities was a function of being able to deploy capital into larger chunks more quickly and into diversified pools with short durations is that what made it compelling brian harris chief executive officer yes we don t there s much less insurance being paid to hedge interest rates on a short security there s less airplane time and analysis when you re buying aaas and all you had to really do was look at the inflows and outflows and you could see through redemptions that is one of the benefits of this cycle where there s a lot of passive investing what happens is you just see forced redemption going on it used to be hedge funds you would see a lot of volatility and you d make a few calls around town and find out what hedge fund was having a problem now it s an etf usually and so when we re buying a whole lot of clo types aaa bonds there s not that many people that own them so one of my originators said to me who s selling those things they look very cheap and i said it s the people that just bought them because they re only two years old and they said well why would they sell them and the answer is because they have to they re taking redemptions in their funds and so we really like moment like that anytime we see a volatility spike we take a look and we ask a very basic question is this a credit problem or is this a liquidity problem and that looked like a liquidity problem to us if we ever saw one rich shane jp morgan analyst so it was much more of a tactical call than the strategic call brian harris chief executive officer it was an opportunistic call yes rich shane jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jill o dwyer ph with ltc partners please proceed with your question jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst hey everybody good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions you raised capital to equity sales which of course stayed with management stake and you raised that for some opportunistic things that were out in the marketplace i m just wondering after you raise that capital and leverage it if you feel like you ve expanded at all now in terms of where you thought those opportunities were going to be brian harris chief executive officer we have a reasonable amount of dry powder we don t think that that december situation is necessarily over we take our cue from the inverted five year and two year as potentially problems ahead and some of the rhetoric coming out of washington right now so we think that there will be some other opportunities and we did raise that small amount of capital really as a hybrid almost as i mentioned in the original call that when i was talking about the quarter we thought rates were low and we borrowed fixed rate fundings from the federal home loan bank of over 280 million and but we originally started by simply buying securities to hold that so that there was no drag effect and no j curve on those funds that we had borrowed because it is secured borrowing but we borrowed the other 100 million for a few reasons one is we felt like we unpacked i think we even said it on the third quarter call that we thought we d be buying securities because we thought volatility would be increasing and we did not have to wait long until it happen have we expanded all of it well we took 700 million in payoffs also so the original plan of the 100 million that we borrowed coupled with the borrowings at the federal home loan bank yes we ve expanded that however with 730 million in payoffs on the bridge loan portfolio we have some cash around but we will it may take a quarter but i don t think it ll be too hard there s plenty of opportunities right now jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst okay thank you and then just curious in terms of playing off what you said in terms of kind of things are expensive there s a lot of capital available like technical difficulty our liquidity in the marketplace i was wondering how that s impacting to your thought process on net lease acquisitions and even more specifically and maybe what you re doing with the dollar general acquisitions and just kind of how that whole thought process is played into the way you re looking in that marketplace brian harris chief executive officer well the marketplace of net lease i think is a difficult place to say you re going to add a whole lot in right now and the main reason being your cost of funds has dramatically increased relative to where the cap rates are on many of those things that are selling you do have the amazon effect taking place in some of those retailers i would argue that rather than talking about the net lease space i d rather talk about the dollar general space and dollar general is one of our favorite companies right now and there s a lot of reasons why we prefer to buy dollar generals one is that there are hundreds of them and you can be rather selective around where you want to buy them two is that trying to word it delicately the dollar general customer is not necessarily the amazon prime customer so and they re oftentimes in less populated areas so less likely to be trafficked by the big retailers that are mostly shrinking as opposed to expanding into areas like that and another thing that we like to do is dollar general has been around for a long time and what the dollar general is doing is they re moving out of a lot of their inline stores and moving right across the street into stand alone source and we like that because we know that they know their customer so they wouldn t be making that move unless they understood they could support it and lastly there is a high barrier to entry to buying dollar generals because the average dollar general costs about 1 4 million so by the time you get through with appraisers and engineers and environmental and lawyers you can get through a pretty big legal bill on a 1 4 million asset so if we were buying one of them i wouldn t do it but when you buy 100 of them that s a very attractive proposition because you do get them at a slightly wider cap rate because of the expense factor that goes with it we don t absorb quite the expenses that other people do jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst right and i appreciate that and i feel the same way you do about dollar general for all those same reasons i ve looked at the dollar general portfolio pretty extensively and it s pretty wise just my last question is you saw a loan book run off and then the need to redeploy that capital i m just wondering if we enter an environment where despite what s happened in the first quarter where you hadn t really had a loan book run off but if we get into future quarters where you re having a loan book runoff just kind of wondering how you guys have thought about replacing that and if you say rotating into other areas if you feel like if and when the loan book runs off will you be able to rotate into these other areas to keep your core growth going brian harris chief executive officer well we think we will be able to but that doesn t mean we will be able to we don t determine those opportunities those are determined by the market but there s always other things we can do one we can give it back to our shareholders if we feel like it but if we re last year we developed during a year where cash was considered the best investment where bonds were down stocks were down we delivered a 14 9 roe when we re delivering an roe like that or even we tend to shoot for as we ve said many times 9 to 10 without anything fancy going on but if we can make a double digit return on equity and we can do that rather easily from what i can tell at this point anyway if it continues like this as long as we can do that we ll just keep investing and rotating around our product mix however if for some reason it got to the point where we didn t think we could deliver a return like that we would probably opt to start giving money back to shareholders rather than trying to fund loans that didn t cover our dividend jill o dwyer ltc partners analyst okay appreciate the conservatism you guys are bringing into the marketplace because we re not really seeing that in too many other areas operator our final question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks just wanted to ask your thoughts on the new york city condo market how much of a concern is the oversupply right now and the decline in demand do you anticipate it to result in distressed projects and could that be an opportunity for ladder brian harris chief executive officer that s an interesting question i don t know how it will be more negative on it than we are we are not comfortable with new york city condos as an investment right now it doesn t mean they won t become a very attractive investment in fact one thing that could change our mind very quickly is if the state and local tax deduction were restored and we think it might be or if it was even raised to 30 000 instead of 10 000 we think that that event alone has really caused a big problem in the space and that could be easily reversed so i don t know if i call that a market condition or a legal condition but it is problematic for sure and that s where i am very concerned i think about residential housing let s not talk about new york city condos let s talk about new york new jersey connecticut and california because i think that there are many factors at work right now in those states that would cause me to be very concerned about any form of positive view toward residential property values jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator this concludes our question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back over to

rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a roughly flat opening on thursday with stocks likely to continue to experience choppy trading traders may be reluctant to make significant moves as they weigh better than expected u s economic data against disappointing news out of the summit between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un the futures recovered from earlier weakness following the release of a report from the commerce department showing u s economic growth slowed by less than expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 meanwhile traders are also digesting news that the trump kim summit ended abruptly without an agreement on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula trump told reporters the north korean dictator wanted the u s to lift all sanctions without having to give up all of his weapons of mass destruction basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn t do that trump said they were willing to de nuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted but we couldn t give up all of the sanctions for that so we continue to work and we ll see but we had to walk away from that particular suggestion he added we had to walk away from that the president noted that the two sides will continue to work toward an agreement although the lack of a deal at the summit may add to recent uncertainty on wall street stocks once again recovered from an early move to the downside on wednesday but showed a lack of direction over the remainder of the session the major averages spent the afternoon lingering

the currency of south africa is regarded as one of the most volatile in the world as it is linked to the world commodities markets which fluctuate regularly it is also impacted by any major political developments in south africa to understand south african currency here is a brief overview of it south africa s physical currency south africa s currency is called the rand and older south africa s banknotes display the big five animals in south africa the rhinoceros elephant lion buffalo and leopard the rand has the symbol r and banknotes are issued in r10 r20 r50 r100 and r200 denominations the other side of these banknotes feature nelson mandela s head as recognition for the way nelson mandela committed himself to south africa and touched all the lives within the country the history of south african banknotes in 1782 the dutch governor van plettenberg was obliged due to his incapacity to obtain enough quantity of money from the netherlands to meet settlement requirements to introduce paper money for the first time in the history of the cape this earliest paper money the cape currency at that time was issued in rixdollar and stiver denominations because the cape had not printing press all notes had to be hand written until around 1803 they had a government tax stamp showing the value and the date of the issue after 1803 all notes were printed but they kept showing the tax stamp for a while in the mid 1860 s several banks used local printed paper money most often made by the cape town printer company called soul solomon co banknotes were imported from england again thereafter this continued until the founding of the banknote factory in the republic of south africa in 1962 since then the south african reserve bank has been responsible for this factory in 1961 south africa changed its currency from pound sterling into rand and cents and when it became a republic in the same year it retained the new currency afterwards the south african reserve bank began to withdraw the old pound sterling currency banknotes and replace them with new currency banknotes the new bank notes in july 2018 a new mandela bank note was launched to commemorate the 28th anniversary of nelson mandela s release from prison these commemorative notes cover all denominations including the r5 coin and have the standard visage of nelson mandela on one side but instead of an image of one of the big five animals on the other side the notes feature a younger image of mandela these nelson mandela banknotes also include a new security feature which consist of little dots on the front and bank of all the notes the mandela banknotes and the older big 5 are both legal tender in south africa the new coin series for south africa was introduced in 1989 by the south african reserve bank coins are issued in cents 5c 10c 20c 50c r1 r2 and r5 denominations 100 cents are equal to r1 the rand coin designs celebrate animals that are common to south africa r1 features a springbok the r2 the kudu and the black wildebeest is found on the r5 south africa s most famous coin is the krugerrand which was the first gold bullion coin in the world and is still the most actively traded coin of its kind how is the value of the rand determined like any commodity the value of the rand is determined by demand and supply if there is high demand for the rand its value will increase if the demand is low the price will drop the value of the rand is also linked to south africa s interest rate if the interest rate is high investors are more likely to invest in the country in order to benefit from the interest rate this will cause the exchange rate of the rand to strengthen unpleasant factors like a year of poor economic performance in south africa or political instability can cause investors to lose confidence in south africa which in turn causes the rand to weaken how the rand compares to other currencies the rand is a lot weaker than the usa dollar and is currently worth in the region of 0 072 dollars which means effectively that you need r13 89 to buy 1 united states dollar the rand is even weaker when compared to the uk pound currently 1 rand is worth in the region 0 056 pound sterling which means you need r17 84 to buy 1 pound sterling the rand is somewhat stronger when compared to the canadian dollar with one rand being worth in the region of 0 096 canadian dollars this means that you need r10 25 to purchase 1 canadian dollar the rand continues to strengthen when compared to the australian dollar with 1 rand worth in the region of 0 10 australian dollars or alternatively r9 94 buys you 1 australian dollar the rand is even stronger when compared to the united arab emirates dirham if you are living in dubai approximately r3 78 will buy you 1 united emirates dirham the exchange regulations established by the south african reserve bank apply to all foreign exchange transactions from and to south africa violation of these

adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal

investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all

ebitda as ebitda further adjusted for acquisition and offering related costs stock based compensation deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting gains losses related to divested businesses or assets sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted ebitda are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding depreciation and amortization from ebitda users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 3 cision defines adjusted net income as net income loss plus provision for or minus benefit from income taxes further adjusted for acquisition and offering related costs gains losses related to divested businesses or assets stock based compensation deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting amortization related to acquired intangibles non recurring interest and losses on extinguishment of debt sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains which together sum to adjusted net income loss before income taxes adjusted net income loss before income taxes is then taxed at an assumed long term corporate tax rate of 33 for 2017 and periods prior and 26 for 2018 and beyond pursuant to our preliminary analysis with respect to recent u s tax law changes to determine adjusted net income the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017 resulted in a provisional net one time tax of 11 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects primarily from a tax on accumulated foreign earnings the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and new limitations on the deductibility of interest our calculation of adjusted net income excludes this provisional net one time tax we continue to finalize the analysis of the tax reform provisions in 2018 all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted net income are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding the amortization related to acquired intangibles users can compare operating performance without regard to highly variable amortization expenses related to our acquisitions in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 4 cision defines adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income as defined above divided by the fully diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding for the period the fully diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding for the respective period assume that the exchange of shares pursuant to our merger with capitol acquisition iii had taken effect as of the

thank you all for joining us on our 2018 fourth quarter and year end conference call today dave and i will provide highlights for 2018 that includes progress toward our long term goals success with our unique e commerce resistant strategy and our performance since our ipo and a look ahead to 2019 dave will provide details on the quarter and discuss the restatement related to our ownership interest in pillarstone as a background to my remarks our accomplishments in 2018 were significant given the distraction of a costly and time consuming proxy contest the disruption in the retail industry and its contagion impact on retail real estate in a rising interest rate environment with that i have three themes that i would like to share with you today maintaining our commitment to achieving our long term goals our successful implementation of our e commerce resistant strategy and our process of creating long term value for our shareholders the first thing i would like to share is our commitment to maintaining and growing a healthy and vibrant company in the best way we can to continue to drive long term value for our shareholders and know that our team is dedicated to achieving these goals that we communicated at the beginning of 2018 our investment strategy is simple high quality properties in markets we know well and make them better a property that s worth owning is worth taking care of and never lose sight of the consumer this strategy has proven the best way to achieve success in both good and turbulent times and that led us to some remarkable industry leading results the process of acquiring properties in exceptional markets that we know and making them better will always be the primary engines of our long term economic growth our work is to communicate the value enhancement process that we have and have created to the marketplace second theme i d like to share is our early recognition in response to the e commerce disruption was deliberate we focused on the consumer and the delivery system of retail goods shifted and provided them services our deep dive into the research and analytics gave us a roadmap to address consumer service basically our research showed us trends and linkages to the consumer that were somewhat time sensitive and applied to a consumer base that varies from millennials to baby boomers within all our markets we link this powerful information to prospective tenants who were primarily entrepreneurs and through them executed leases to meet these service needs by choosing the right tenant with lease terms that are mutually beneficial we established the foundation to provide financial viability and longevity to and within our communities we now have over 1 300 tenants in whitestone that provide the kitchen living room home offices exercise rooms cleaners beauty salon high life entertainment emergency medical treatment and on and on and on like the very services that most of you on this call still can use my third and final theme is our long term value creation the selection of properties and the integration of our business model has driven value creation and will continue to do so we began with a 150 million of eclectic asset and the strategy that was contrarian to most retail real estate owners and began scaling its business utilizing retail real estate under the public market umbrella it has been eight years since our ipo and we now have a portfolio of high quality properties in great markets with an estimated real estate value of approximately 1 5 billion in business friendly state of texas and arizona the markets we re in are the highest growing markets in the country that includes houston dallas fort worth austin san antonio phoenix mesa gilbert chandler and scottsdale creating long term enterprise value is clearly a defined process that includes the timely synchronization of buying properties strategically repositioning operating and selling and judiciously integrating capital some of our highlights include the disposition of five properties that were non core or had limited upside which included the three from our investment in pillarstone for 29 million resulting in a net profit of 11 3 million strengthening our balance sheet with an expanded upsized credit facility with improved term and 70 of our debt locked in with fixed rate upgrading our overall quality of our portfolio and achieving same store net operating income growth of 3 3 annualized base rent increases of 3 3 per square foot and an occupancy growth of 30 basis points our work is making progress as we ve achieved d a cost reductions and improvement in our debt leverage ratios we are optimistic about 2019 with a pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities in our portfolio including newly entitled properties out parcels and the vacant land we have an acquisition pipeline with sellers interested in exchanging properties for operating partnership units and an experienced leasing team that is energized we expect progress to continue as we have over the past eight years of new resources key to our value proposition is our people and it s management s responsibility to assure our shareholders that we are developing future managers and leaders since our beginning we have instituted management training at all levels with our signature program being reed which stands for real estate executive development program at the senior and regional level as we look toward our first scholar program in conjunction with the jones graduate school of business with rice university along with our training and development programs every single associate in whitestone is a whitestone shareholder with that i d like to conclude 2018 was a year that we continued to make progress toward our long term goals we continued to strengthen our e commerce resistant business market and we continue to create value within our portfolio we expect 2019 to continue to improve occupancies operating margins and net operating income as we expand our footprint with that i ll now turn the call over to dave dave david k holeman chief financial officer thanks jim first let me address the 2018 quarterly restatement we announced last night i think it would be helpful for me to give a brief summary december of 2016 whitestone contributed 14 non core properties the pillarstone op for aggregate consideration of 84 million consisting of op unit and the assumption of 65 million in debt both contribution of the asset whitestone owned 81 4 of pillarstone op prior to 2018 we accounted for our 81 4 ownership of these properties under the profit sharing method which required us to continue to recognize the asset and the liability of pillarstone in our financials and defer the gain of approximately 19 million from the original contribution in january 2018 whitestone adopted the new revenue recognition standard and evaluated the transaction based on those standard based on consultation of advisors and ultimately our judgment regarding the control criteria under those revenue recognition standard we concluded that the transfer of the control criteria has not been met and we should continue to recognize those assets and liabilities of whitestone in our financial and defer any gain from the contribution in august of 2018 we received a comment letter from the sec regarding our application of the new revenue recognition standard related to this transaction after numerous communications with the sec staff in february of 2019 the staff informed the company that it objected to our conclusion regarding the assessment of the transfer of control criteria in topic 606 with respect to the contribution and objected to the company s continued recognition of the underlying asset and liabilities associated with the contribution subsequent to january 1 2018 accordingly the company has determined it will restate the three previously issued 2018 quarterly financial and will do so in our form 10 k to be filed prior to march 18 2019 because this change from the profit sharing method is only applicable for periods ending after giving effect to the implementation of topic 606 no periods prior to january 1 2018 are affected by this change as a result of the restatement company will derecognize the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the contribution as of january 1 2018 and will recognize the company s investment in pillarstone op under the equity method the 2018 year end financials presented in our press release and discussed today reflect the new accounting treatment and reflect an adjustment to increase our january 1 2018 retained earnings by 19 1 million for the nine months ended september 30 2018 we expect the restatement to reduce revenue and expenses by 11 3 million and 10 2 million respectively and increase equity in earnings of real estate partnership by 1 8 million resulting in a 600 000 increase to net income the adjustment in the quarters are roughly one third of those amounts and we expect the restatement to favorably impact quarterly ffo by nominal amount in light of these facts and determination we are in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures this evaluation could result in the identification of one or more material weaknesses that impact the company s determination of the effectiveness of those controls for previously reported period and the year now let me provide a few details from our financial and operating results for the quarter and year as jim commented in 2018 we had to overcome several challenges and we were able to make progress on a few of our key metrics if not all while our 2018 funds from operations core per share reflects a decrease from 2017 we believe the progress we have made this year which includes upgrading the portfolio through selective dispositions improving our debt structure to reducing leverage increasing tenure and fixing the rate on a larger percentage of our debt reducing our g a cost and enhancing our corporate governance will all result in long term value creation for our shareholders funds from operations per share was 0 94 for 2018 an increase of 0 01 or 0 93 in 2017 this per share increase was largely driven by same store growth of 3 3 for the year and reduction in our share based compensation expense of 3 7 million and lower acquisition cost the items increasing funds from operations were offset by higher borrowing costs lower noi from our 2017 acquisition increases in our other general and administrative costs of 1 3 million and proxy contest professional fees of 2 5 million we report funds from operation core adjusting the nareit definition by excluding share based compensation proxy contest professional fees and early debt extinguishment costs in 2018 and excluding share based compensation and acquisition cost in 2017 reflecting these adjustments funds from operation core was 1 16 for 2018 down 0 09 from 2017 our same store net operating income growth was a strong 3 3 for the year but reduced to 0 6 for the second half of 2018 with the inclusion of our may 2017 acquisition in our same store pool the second half same store growth is adjusted to approximately 1 taking into account fourth quarter adjustment relating to tenant write offs and tam true ups which are not expected to repeat occupancy grew 30 basis points from year end 2017 but was down 40 basis points from last quarter this was largely driven by the move out of a grocer in our phoenix market which was on a low rent roundly we believe this actually will turn in quite positive for the company in the coming years for terminating this lease whitestone received the building and improvement on the land that were previously owned by the grocer whitestone expects to break this 47 000 square foot space into smaller spaces and lease at a much higher rate per square foot than the big box ground lease rental rates continued to expand with our abr at 19 35 at year end compared to 18 97 in q3 and 18 82 a year ago our leasing activity in 2018 with robust with leasing spreads up 7 on new leases and a 11 1 on renewal leases for a blended increase of 10 3 our weighted average lease term was 4 4 years our contractual rate was inaudible which is 5 higher in our in place abr at year end on the cost side our fourth quarter g a expenses were 1 1 million or 17 lower than a year ago our annual g a cost adjusting for proxy contest cost in 2018 and acquisition expenses in 2017 were 1 8 million or 8 lower for the full year our interest expense was 600 000 higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 than a year ago this was driven by a 1 increase in our variable rate debt for the year our interest expense was 3 8 million higher than 2017 approximately half of this increase for the year is a result of rising interest rate as of today we have approximately 70 of our debt at fixed rate and intend to increase this percentage to 85 in q1 of 2019 subsequent to year end we amended our credit facility increasing the overall size to 515 million improving the pricing and terms extending the overall term and fixing rates on an additional 55 million of variable rate debt we are providing our initial financial guidance for 2019 our guidance reflects management s view of current and future market conditions as well as the earnings impact of events referenced in our earnings release and supplemental data package this guidance does not include the operational or capital impact of any future unannounced acquisitions or dispositions the assumption for our 2019 guidance include same store net operating income growth 1 5 to 2 year end occupancy of 90 to 92 and an average interest rate on our debt for 2019 of 4 3 we project net income per share to be in the range of 0 21 to 0 25 funds from operations to be in the range of 0 90 to 0 94 per share and funds from operations core to be in the range in the 1 06 to 1 10 per share although we don t give guidance on a quarterly basis given we are two thirds of the way into our first quarter i would like to highlight the fact that the first quarter typically has higher professional and accounting fees relative the other follow on orders and with that jim and i will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions we will now take our first question from craig kucera of b riley fbr please go ahead craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst hi good morning guys james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer good morning craig david k holeman chief financial officer yeah craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst i wanted to start with some of the assumptions in guidance with your average interest rate i think you re looking at something like a 4 3 kind of what is i think in the fourth quarter you were at about 3 9 on your fixed rate you had the line i guess are you assuming terming out i know you mentioned taking things from 70 to 85 can you just provide a little more color on what that assumption is david k holeman chief financial officer sure i think a couple of factors craig as we mentioned obviously looking to term out and fix the rate on about another 15 of our debt and then secondly we are building an increased assumption on the remaining variable rate debt as well craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst and what is that assumption i think the market has kind of assumed that the fed might be done raising rates david k holeman chief financial officer i think we ve assumed kind of one rate increase within our projections craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst okay and from the standpoint of the pillarstone contribution going forward can you give us some color on sort of post the assets that were sold what the quarterly or annual income statement impact is expected to be david k holeman chief financial officer maybe i to make sure i understand your question i think obviously the guidance we ve given reflect the disposition of assets that we ve done this year so to your question beyond that craig to make sure i understand it craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst yeah well i mean you re now reporting it on the equity method and i m just trying to determine what the net impact of that will be on a quarterly or annual basis david k holeman chief financial officer i think the change in accounting will have minimal impact on our financial results it s largely a presentation of pillarstone under the equity method versus grossing up under the profit sharing method we did it showed the impact of it did show impact of our 2018 disposition i think in our 2019 guidance and sup data craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst okay and just from the standpoint of trying to we have the pillarstone rents but we don t have the expenses as we kind of think about how to consider net asset value calculations going forward do you have a sense of what the operating expense is for the existing assets or maybe a operating expense margin that we can consider david k holeman chief financial officer i think the results represented in our fourth quarter reflect the new method of accounting but those would be the kind of the expected results going forward the expected margins you see in revenue levels et cetera craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst all right thanks james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer welcome operator we will now take our next question from anthony hau of suntrust please go ahead anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst going morning guys you know 2019 same store noi is expected to be lower than previous years can you guys provide some more color on the underlying assumptions in terms of occupancy lease spreads rent bumps and bad debt reserve david k holeman chief financial officer i m sorry would you repeat the first part of your question i heard the end i just didn t hear the very first part anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst sure so 19 same store noi guidance is expected to be lower than in previous years can you just provide more color on the underlying assumptions in terms of occupancy lease spreads rent bumps and our bad debt reserves unidentified speaker sure so 2019 we ve given in our guidance we ve given the assumptions regarding same store growth of a 0 5 to 2 i think as i mentioned our same store growth was 3 3 but obviously each period is reported as a different pool of same store asset based on ownership assets of the entire period our same store growth for the second half of the year including our 2017 acquisitions was 1 though we reflected that inclusion of those assets in our expectation of same store growth in 2019 as far as occupancy i think we ve given guidance of 90 to 92 and then from those are probably the two largest drivers of our assumptions regarding noi for 2019 now bad debt we on the bad debt side we don t expect any significant difference from our current levels we continue to see that improve slightly basically flat year over year anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and typically how much do you have baked in is it 100 bips of revenue david k holeman chief financial officer typically how much do we do what anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst how much bad debt reserve was embedded in the same store noi is it 100 bips of gross revenue or 75 bips david k holeman chief financial officer our bad debt is generally run in 1 to 2 of revenue but i think we clearly show that in our quarterly financials you ll see bad debt has typically been in the 1 to 2 of revenue anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and can you guys provide more color on why the leasing spreads were so weak this quarter and how should that trend heading into 19 david k holeman chief financial officer i think the first thing is just the inclusion of some 17 acquisitions into that pool one of the things that typically happens is whitestone will acquire a property and then it takes us a bit of time to apply our model and to really begin to drive rates so the largest change in the second half of the year was the inclusion of the 17 acquisitions in the pool i did mention in the fourth quarter there were about 250 000 of the things that we don t expect to repeat related to move outs then and some tam true up anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and the increased share count in 19 is that caused by options and the money or are you guys planning to raise equity david k holeman chief financial officer yes the share count assumes that the related to the additional dilutive impact of shares in 19 over what was out there today so it s not any assumption of raising additional shares anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it thanks operator operator instructions we will now take our next question from john massocca of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst good morning james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer good morning john how are you john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst good so the 65 million of debt that you swapped out kind of subsequent to quarter end what was the rate on that david k holeman chief financial officer so it was so i think you are referring to pillarstone s debt that no longer is on our balance sheet that had kind of three pieces of debt the first one was two pieces of mortgage debt which are at i think roughly 26 million of it is in the 4 range 16 million of it is in the right at 5 and then the balance was the 6 million amount of whitestone which is roughly 4 john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst and then the kind of interest inaudible company loan between you and pillarstone what s the long term plan for that is that the you sell asset as the pillarstone sells assets to continue paying that off just any color you can provide there and how maybe that gets resolved going forward david k holeman chief financial officer sure i think as we created the original contribution involved about 15 million and 16 million of loan from whitestone to pillarstone that was paid down to approximately 6 million at the end of the year and we expect to continue to further to have that paid down and to further remove ourselves from the pillarstone assets john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst okay and is there anything other than the the kind of grocer moving out that you mentioned that is driving kind of the occupancy outlook going forward with any other tenants or anything maybe in the lease roll that s coming up here in 19 or you really see some expected move outs just any color there would be helpful david k holeman chief financial officer john i think as you guys all know our tenant mix is has a lot of diversity our largest tenant is about 3 so there is no so typically we renew a lot of tenants each year and then provide a lot ph activities but there s nothing in particular no large move outs we are expecting obviously in our portfolio we turn in a fair amount of portfolio each year john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst okay and then lastly maybe with regards to kind of your conversations with the sec is there anything maybe besides kind of the differing interpretation of the rules around pillarstone that kind of cause them to objects to how you are classifying personal for accounting reasons and just kind of thinking more as you go forward and you kind of examine the effectiveness of your controls over accounting is there anything else that was kind of highlighted or flagged that maybe we should know about or was it just pretty much simply this issue and there was a divergence in opinion as to what how technical difficulty for this entity david k holeman chief financial officer i think ultimately the company made a determination to involve judgement around the control yes we objected to that judgement and we are very clear on that and so there s really nothing else there as far as the evaluation of our controls we will clearly look at our controls over financial reporting and disclosures and a step whether they were affected john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst all right that s it for me thank you very much james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer all right thanks john operator we will now take our next question from anthony hau of suntrust please go ahead ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey this ki bin good morning everyone just wanted to make some comments about the sec and evaluating the control of them and disclosures i guess a couple of questions one is that 100 self evaluating or self policing on the accounting controls second is there ongoing is there going to be ongoing dialog or communication with sec regarding the other control david k holeman chief financial officer thanks ki bin obviously with i can t speak to the sec s actions going forward i m not aware of any ongoing dialog we would expect to have with the sec as far as the evaluation of control that is conducted by the company obviously participation of the executive officers in that is going as we like it ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and should we is there any impact to at previous quarter s ffo per share from the whole accounting reshuffling with pillarstone david k holeman chief financial officer there is not i think the impact is that that is it s small it s very very small impact to ffo so for the for the year there will be mitigated the impact of revenue and expenses to net income the impact for the previous three quarters of the year is nominal on a nominal on a dollar basis and very nominal on a share basis and it will be nominally accretive but very small ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and in terms of like just the background on the deal you guys sold i believe 20 of it but that was to the ceo and maybe a couple of board members at the end of the day when everything that s happened was it really worth it to do that kind of minor transaction david k holeman chief financial officer yes ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and i guess what was the overall goal david k holeman chief financial officer sure thanks for your question ki i think we have clearly communicated previously that transaction and the goals of whitestone i don t believe technical difficulty is going to give you some more time to go back and reimagine ph all those things that have been previously communicated and discussed james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer yes i d like to make a comment on that see ki bin i know we talked about this sometime ago and you ve always expressed an interest that you d like to see whitestone become a pure play so we had approached it that way of bringing getting whitestone to become a pure play without the nature of fire selling the assets because at the time we looked at the transaction they were valued relatively low and we didn t think that was fair to the whitestone shareholders to let that the profitability of those assets seep out of our hand so what we did is we want to investment bankers and they looked at all the strategic alternatives available to us and recommended that we could do a transaction like this with no future liability from whitestone by spinning off pillarstone assets like that and the future liability to adopt any of those assets really was in the hands of pillarstone which made it kind of a no risk situation with an we getting the best price out of it at the beginning of the transaction and then profiting further in 80 of the development risk the sec rulings brings us one stock close to becoming a pure play we now only have about 6 million left in debt that is owed to whitestone from pillarstone yet whitestone has 80 interest in all of the upside in pillarstone i hope that s helpful for you to understand it ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes that helpful and same store noi you mentioned the inaudible loss in the fourth quarter i m just curious how that is there any kind of follow on impact to co tenancy to other retailers in that center and how does that configure into your guidance if there is one david k holeman chief financial officer yeah there is no impact in community centered business center and i think as i communicated it was a low lower rent ground lease and so there s really no impact to any of the centers and the impact of that is all built into our guidance ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right thank you operator we will now take our next question from john massocca of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst just two quick kind of follow ups from me one is on the g a front understanding there is going to be some potential seasonal uptick in 1q is there also potential for maybe some kind of one time ish g a associated with kind of the examining of the effectiveness of controls and with the the dealing with the sec as you guys have kind of gone through here in 1q david k holeman chief financial officer well i think we ve commented that from a g a perspective obviously we have a commitment to continue to decrease that level as well as scale it and just say the first quarter typically had just a higher percentage of professional fees and accounting fees related to us audit those are a little higher this year probably that as a result of this but nothing material john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst and then the restatements didn t shouldn t have any impact on the credit facility you guys recut in 1q correct david k holeman chief financial officer that s right they the restatements had no impact on the credit facility or any of the covenants they were calculated in the same manner previously as they will be going forward john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst okay that s it from me thank you james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer thank you john operator there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to management for any additional or closing remarks james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer yes thank you operator and thank you all for joining us again i d just like to go back and say that 2018 was a solid year for us one that we had no less interest in driving the value of the portfolio than previous ones the distractions are time consuming as you all know and we were able to overcome that with our tenacity and skill and experience we have in terms of this business we re still remain very excited about our business model we think that it answers the questions to many of the concerns that people have about the consumers and we re starting to bring to our properties tenants with stronger balance sheet and also a longer work histories where they have opened up multiple locations with us so i thank you for your continued confidence and i think you re going to find 2019 to be very promising year for all of us and really do appreciate your consideration and the loyalty you ve given us in terms of being with us since our

our team delivered solid results in 2018 even as we worked to complete the integration of starwood hotels resorts our rooms grew by nearly 5 percent net worldwide revenue per available room or revpar increased nearly 3 percent general and administrative expenses rose only 1 percent and adjusted earnings per share surged 48 percent we ended the year with a record 1 3 million rooms operating under

especially strong in north america particularly for residence inn fairfield inn suites and courtyard in the fourth quarter north america systemwide revpar increased 0 2 percent and worldwide systemwide revpar increased 1 3 percent north american revpar growth in the quarter was impacted by labor strikes in eight north american markets and weaker than expected transient demand for the industry we expect north america revpar will increase 1 to 2 percent in the first quarter reflecting the impact of the government shutdown offset by a favorable calendar comparison outside north america revpar growth is expected to moderate slightly in the first quarter due to the slower economic growth outlook in the asia pacific region for the full year 2019 we expect north america and worldwide revpar growth of 1 to 3 percent and rooms growth of roughly 5 5 percent net this should yield an increase in total fee revenue of 5 to 7 percent despite foreign exchange headwinds it should also enable us to return at least 3 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in 2019 even assuming no asset sales for the year we are pleased that just over two years since the

743 million in the 2018 fourth quarter an 8 percent increase over base management and franchise fees of 688 million in the year ago quarter the year over year increase in these fees is primarily attributable to unit growth higher credit card branding fees and higher revpar fourth quarter 2018 incentive management fees totaled 167 million a 4 percent decrease compared to incentive management fees of 174 million in the year ago quarter the year over year decrease largely reflects the impact of labor strikes unfavorable comparisons in the middle east and unfavorable foreign exchange

the year ago quarter compared to the year ago quarter results were negatively impacted by 14 million from hotels sold during or after the fourth quarter of 2017 that negative impact was mostly offset

performance measures in our press release and schedules and on the related conference call we report certain financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap we discuss management s reasons for reporting these non gaap measures below and the press release schedules reconcile the most directly comparable gaap measure to each non gaap measure that we refer to although management evaluates and presents these non gaap measures for the reasons described below please be aware that these non gaap measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue operating income income from continuing operations net income earnings per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by gaap in addition we may calculate and or present these non gaap financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report and as a result the non gaap measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin exclude cost reimbursement revenue reimbursed expenses starwood merger costs presented in the merger related costs and charges caption of our income statements and net purchase accounting revisions adjusted operating income margin reflects adjusted operating income divided by adjusted total revenues we believe that these are meaningful metrics because they allow for period over period comparisons of our ongoing operations before these items and for the reasons further described below adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps reflect our net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of cost reimbursement revenue reimbursed expenses merger related costs charges and other merger related adjustments due to purchase accounting the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in avendra and the income tax effect of these adjustments and the impact of the u s tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we calculate the income tax effect of the adjustments using an estimated tax rate applicable to each adjustment we believe that these measures are meaningful indicators of our performance because they allow for period over period comparisons of our ongoing operations before these items and for the reasons further described below adjusted earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda reflects net income excluding the impact of the following items cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses interest expense depreciation including depreciation classified in reimbursed expenses as discussed below amortization and provision for income taxes pre tax transaction and transition costs associated with the starwood merger and share based compensation expense for all periods presented when applicable adjusted ebitda also excludes gains and losses on asset dispositions made by us or by our joint venture investees in our presentations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps we exclude transaction and transition costs associated with the starwood merger which we record in the merger related costs and charges caption of our income statements and other merger related adjustments due to purchase accounting to allow for period over period comparisons of our ongoing operations before the impact of these items we exclude cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses which relate to property level and centralized programs and services that we operate for the benefit of our hotel owners we do not operate these programs and services to generate a profit over the contract term and accordingly when we recover the costs that we incur for these programs and services from our hotel owners we do not seek a mark up for property level services our owners typically reimburse us at the same time that we incur expenses however for centralized programs and services our owners may reimburse us before or after we incur expenses causing temporary timing differences between the costs we incur and the related reimbursement from hotel owners in our operating and net income over the long term these programs and services are not designed to impact our economics either positively or negatively because we do not retain any such profits or losses over time we exclude the net impact when evaluating period over period changes in our operating results a 14 marriott international inc explanation of non gaap financial and performance measures we believe that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period over period comparisons of our ongoing operations before these items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies we use adjusted ebitda to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provisions for income taxes can vary considerably among companies our adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under depreciation amortization and other as well as depreciation classified in reimbursed expenses and contract investment amortization in our consolidated statements of income our income statements because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets depreciation classified in reimbursed expenses reflects depreciation of marriott owned assets for which we receive cash from owners to reimburse the company for its investments made for the benefit of the system these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies we exclude share based compensation expense in all periods presented to address the considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share based payment awards differently both in the type and quantity of awards granted revpar in addition to the foregoing non gaap financial measures we present revenue per available room revpar as a performance measure we believe revpar is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we calculate revpar by dividing room sales recorded in local currency for comparable properties by room nights available for the period we present growth in comparative pro forma combined company revpar on a constant dollar basis which we calculate by applying exchange rates for the current period to each period presented we believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our properties performance as it removes currency fluctuations from the presentation of such results a 15 source marriott international inc related links

thank you all for joining us on our 2018 fourth quarter and year end conference call today dave and i will provide highlights for 2018 that includes progress toward our long term goals success with our unique e commerce resistant strategy and our performance since our ipo and a look ahead to 2019 dave will provide details on the quarter and discuss the restatement related to our ownership interest in pillarstone as a background to my remarks our accomplishments in 2018 were significant given the distraction of a costly and time consuming proxy contest the disruption in the retail industry and its contagion impact on retail real estate in a rising interest rate environment with that i have three themes that i would like to share with you today maintaining our commitment to achieving our long term goals our successful implementation of our e commerce resistant strategy and our process of creating long term value for our shareholders the first thing i would like to share is our commitment to maintaining and growing a healthy and vibrant company in the best way we can to continue to drive long term value for our shareholders and know that our team is dedicated to achieving these goals that we communicated at the beginning of 2018 our investment strategy is simple high quality properties in markets we know well and make them better a property that s worth owning is worth taking care of and never lose sight of the consumer this strategy has proven the best way to achieve success in both good and turbulent times and that led us to some remarkable industry leading results the process of acquiring properties in exceptional markets that we know and making them better will always be the primary engines of our long term economic growth our work is to communicate the value enhancement process that we have and have created to the marketplace second theme i d like to share is our early recognition in response to the e commerce disruption was deliberate we focused on the consumer and the delivery system of retail goods shifted and provided them services our deep dive into the research and analytics gave us a roadmap to address consumer service basically our research showed us trends and linkages to the consumer that were somewhat time sensitive and applied to a consumer base that varies from millennials to baby boomers within all our markets we link this powerful information to prospective tenants who were primarily entrepreneurs and through them executed leases to meet these service needs by choosing the right tenant with lease terms that are mutually beneficial we established the foundation to provide financial viability and longevity to and within our communities we now have over 1 300 tenants in whitestone that provide the kitchen living room home offices exercise rooms cleaners beauty salon high life entertainment emergency medical treatment and on and on and on like the very services that most of you on this call still can use my third and final theme is our long term value creation the selection of properties and the integration of our business model has driven value creation and will continue to do so we began with a 150 million of eclectic asset and the strategy that was contrarian to most retail real estate owners and began scaling its business utilizing retail real estate under the public market umbrella it has been eight years since our ipo and we now have a portfolio of high quality properties in great markets with an estimated real estate value of approximately 1 5 billion in business friendly state of texas and arizona the markets we re in are the highest growing markets in the country that includes houston dallas fort worth austin san antonio phoenix mesa gilbert chandler and scottsdale creating long term enterprise value is clearly a defined process that includes the timely synchronization of buying properties strategically repositioning operating and selling and judiciously integrating capital some of our highlights include the disposition of five properties that were non core or had limited upside which included the three from our investment in pillarstone for 29 million resulting in a net profit of 11 3 million strengthening our balance sheet with an expanded upsized credit facility with improved term and 70 of our debt locked in with fixed rate upgrading our overall quality of our portfolio and achieving same store net operating income growth of 3 3 annualized base rent increases of 3 3 per square foot and an occupancy growth of 30 basis points our work is making progress as we ve achieved d a cost reductions and improvement in our debt leverage ratios we are optimistic about 2019 with a pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities in our portfolio including newly entitled properties out parcels and the vacant land we have an acquisition pipeline with sellers interested in exchanging properties for operating partnership units and an experienced leasing team that is energized we expect progress to continue as we have over the past eight years of new resources key to our value proposition is our people and it s management s responsibility to assure our shareholders that we are developing future managers and leaders since our beginning we have instituted management training at all levels with our signature program being reed which stands for real estate executive development program at the senior and regional level as we look toward our first scholar program in conjunction with the jones graduate school of business with rice university along with our training and development programs every single associate in whitestone is a whitestone shareholder with that i d like to conclude 2018 was a year that we continued to make progress toward our long term goals we continued to strengthen our e commerce resistant business market and we continue to create value within our portfolio we expect 2019 to continue to improve occupancies operating margins and net operating income as we expand our footprint with that i ll now turn the call over to dave dave david k holeman chief financial officer thanks jim first let me address the 2018 quarterly restatement we announced last night i think it would be helpful for me to give a brief summary december of 2016 whitestone contributed 14 non core properties the pillarstone op for aggregate consideration of 84 million consisting of op unit and the assumption of 65 million in debt both contribution of the asset whitestone owned 81 4 of pillarstone op prior to 2018 we accounted for our 81 4 ownership of these properties under the profit sharing method which required us to continue to recognize the asset and the liability of pillarstone in our financials and defer the gain of approximately 19 million from the original contribution in january 2018 whitestone adopted the new revenue recognition standard and evaluated the transaction based on those standard based on consultation of advisors and ultimately our judgment regarding the control criteria under those revenue recognition standard we concluded that the transfer of the control criteria has not been met and we should continue to recognize those assets and liabilities of whitestone in our financial and defer any gain from the contribution in august of 2018 we received a comment letter from the sec regarding our application of the new revenue recognition standard related to this transaction after numerous communications with the sec staff in february of 2019 the staff informed the company that it objected to our conclusion regarding the assessment of the transfer of control criteria in topic 606 with respect to the contribution and objected to the company s continued recognition of the underlying asset and liabilities associated with the contribution subsequent to january 1 2018 accordingly the company has determined it will restate the three previously issued 2018 quarterly financial and will do so in our form 10 k to be filed prior to march 18 2019 because this change from the profit sharing method is only applicable for periods ending after giving effect to the implementation of topic 606 no periods prior to january 1 2018 are affected by this change as a result of the restatement company will derecognize the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the contribution as of january 1 2018 and will recognize the company s investment in pillarstone op under the equity method the 2018 year end financials presented in our press release and discussed today reflect the new accounting treatment and reflect an adjustment to increase our january 1 2018 retained earnings by 19 1 million for the nine months ended september 30 2018 we expect the restatement to reduce revenue and expenses by 11 3 million and 10 2 million respectively and increase equity in earnings of real estate partnership by 1 8 million resulting in a 600 000 increase to net income the adjustment in the quarters are roughly one third of those amounts and we expect the restatement to favorably impact quarterly ffo by nominal amount in light of these facts and determination we are in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures this evaluation could result in the identification of one or more material weaknesses that impact the company s determination of the effectiveness of those controls for previously reported period and the year now let me provide a few details from our financial and operating results for the quarter and year as jim commented in 2018 we had to overcome several challenges and we were able to make progress on a few of our key metrics if not all while our 2018 funds from operations core per share reflects a decrease from 2017 we believe the progress we have made this year which includes upgrading the portfolio through selective dispositions improving our debt structure to reducing leverage increasing tenure and fixing the rate on a larger percentage of our debt reducing our g a cost and enhancing our corporate governance will all result in long term value creation for our shareholders funds from operations per share was 0 94 for 2018 an increase of 0 01 or 0 93 in 2017 this per share increase was largely driven by same store growth of 3 3 for the year and reduction in our share based compensation expense of 3 7 million and lower acquisition cost the items increasing funds from operations were offset by higher borrowing costs lower noi from our 2017 acquisition increases in our other general and administrative costs of 1 3 million and proxy contest professional fees of 2 5 million we report funds from operation core adjusting the nareit definition by excluding share based compensation proxy contest professional fees and early debt extinguishment costs in 2018 and excluding share based compensation and acquisition cost in 2017 reflecting these adjustments funds from operation core was 1 16 for 2018 down 0 09 from 2017 our same store net operating income growth was a strong 3 3 for the year but reduced to 0 6 for the second half of 2018 with the inclusion of our may 2017 acquisition in our same store pool the second half same store growth is adjusted to approximately 1 taking into account fourth quarter adjustment relating to tenant write offs and tam true ups which are not expected to repeat occupancy grew 30 basis points from year end 2017 but was down 40 basis points from last quarter this was largely driven by the move out of a grocer in our phoenix market which was on a low rent roundly we believe this actually will turn in quite positive for the company in the coming years for terminating this lease whitestone received the building and improvement on the land that were previously owned by the grocer whitestone expects to break this 47 000 square foot space into smaller spaces and lease at a much higher rate per square foot than the big box ground lease rental rates continued to expand with our abr at 19 35 at year end compared to 18 97 in q3 and 18 82 a year ago our leasing activity in 2018 with robust with leasing spreads up 7 on new leases and a 11 1 on renewal leases for a blended increase of 10 3 our weighted average lease term was 4 4 years our contractual rate was inaudible which is 5 higher in our in place abr at year end on the cost side our fourth quarter g a expenses were 1 1 million or 17 lower than a year ago our annual g a cost adjusting for proxy contest cost in 2018 and acquisition expenses in 2017 were 1 8 million or 8 lower for the full year our interest expense was 600 000 higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 than a year ago this was driven by a 1 increase in our variable rate debt for the year our interest expense was 3 8 million higher than 2017 approximately half of this increase for the year is a result of rising interest rate as of today we have approximately 70 of our debt at fixed rate and intend to increase this percentage to 85 in q1 of 2019 subsequent to year end we amended our credit facility increasing the overall size to 515 million improving the pricing and terms extending the overall term and fixing rates on an additional 55 million of variable rate debt we are providing our initial financial guidance for 2019 our guidance reflects management s view of current and future market conditions as well as the earnings impact of events referenced in our earnings release and supplemental data package this guidance does not include the operational or capital impact of any future unannounced acquisitions or dispositions the assumption for our 2019 guidance include same store net operating income growth 1 5 to 2 year end occupancy of 90 to 92 and an average interest rate on our debt for 2019 of 4 3 we project net income per share to be in the range of 0 21 to 0 25 funds from operations to be in the range of 0 90 to 0 94 per share and funds from operations core to be in the range in the 1 06 to 1 10 per share although we don t give guidance on a quarterly basis given we are two thirds of the way into our first quarter i would like to highlight the fact that the first quarter typically has higher professional and accounting fees relative the other follow on orders and with that jim and i will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions we will now take our first question from craig kucera of b riley fbr please go ahead craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst hi good morning guys james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer good morning craig david k holeman chief financial officer yeah craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst i wanted to start with some of the assumptions in guidance with your average interest rate i think you re looking at something like a 4 3 kind of what is i think in the fourth quarter you were at about 3 9 on your fixed rate you had the line i guess are you assuming terming out i know you mentioned taking things from 70 to 85 can you just provide a little more color on what that assumption is david k holeman chief financial officer sure i think a couple of factors craig as we mentioned obviously looking to term out and fix the rate on about another 15 of our debt and then secondly we are building an increased assumption on the remaining variable rate debt as well craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst and what is that assumption i think the market has kind of assumed that the fed might be done raising rates david k holeman chief financial officer i think we ve assumed kind of one rate increase within our projections craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst okay and from the standpoint of the pillarstone contribution going forward can you give us some color on sort of post the assets that were sold what the quarterly or annual income statement impact is expected to be david k holeman chief financial officer maybe i to make sure i understand your question i think obviously the guidance we ve given reflect the disposition of assets that we ve done this year so to your question beyond that craig to make sure i understand it craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst yeah well i mean you re now reporting it on the equity method and i m just trying to determine what the net impact of that will be on a quarterly or annual basis david k holeman chief financial officer i think the change in accounting will have minimal impact on our financial results it s largely a presentation of pillarstone under the equity method versus grossing up under the profit sharing method we did it showed the impact of it did show impact of our 2018 disposition i think in our 2019 guidance and sup data craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst okay and just from the standpoint of trying to we have the pillarstone rents but we don t have the expenses as we kind of think about how to consider net asset value calculations going forward do you have a sense of what the operating expense is for the existing assets or maybe a operating expense margin that we can consider david k holeman chief financial officer i think the results represented in our fourth quarter reflect the new method of accounting but those would be the kind of the expected results going forward the expected margins you see in revenue levels et cetera craig kucera b riley fbr inc analyst all right thanks james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer welcome operator we will now take our next question from anthony hau of suntrust please go ahead anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst going morning guys you know 2019 same store noi is expected to be lower than previous years can you guys provide some more color on the underlying assumptions in terms of occupancy lease spreads rent bumps and bad debt reserve david k holeman chief financial officer i m sorry would you repeat the first part of your question i heard the end i just didn t hear the very first part anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst sure so 19 same store noi guidance is expected to be lower than in previous years can you just provide more color on the underlying assumptions in terms of occupancy lease spreads rent bumps and our bad debt reserves unidentified speaker sure so 2019 we ve given in our guidance we ve given the assumptions regarding same store growth of a 0 5 to 2 i think as i mentioned our same store growth was 3 3 but obviously each period is reported as a different pool of same store asset based on ownership assets of the entire period our same store growth for the second half of the year including our 2017 acquisitions was 1 though we reflected that inclusion of those assets in our expectation of same store growth in 2019 as far as occupancy i think we ve given guidance of 90 to 92 and then from those are probably the two largest drivers of our assumptions regarding noi for 2019 now bad debt we on the bad debt side we don t expect any significant difference from our current levels we continue to see that improve slightly basically flat year over year anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and typically how much do you have baked in is it 100 bips of revenue david k holeman chief financial officer typically how much do we do what anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst how much bad debt reserve was embedded in the same store noi is it 100 bips of gross revenue or 75 bips david k holeman chief financial officer our bad debt is generally run in 1 to 2 of revenue but i think we clearly show that in our quarterly financials you ll see bad debt has typically been in the 1 to 2 of revenue anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and can you guys provide more color on why the leasing spreads were so weak this quarter and how should that trend heading into 19 david k holeman chief financial officer i think the first thing is just the inclusion of some 17 acquisitions into that pool one of the things that typically happens is whitestone will acquire a property and then it takes us a bit of time to apply our model and to really begin to drive rates so the largest change in the second half of the year was the inclusion of the 17 acquisitions in the pool i did mention in the fourth quarter there were about 250 000 of the things that we don t expect to repeat related to move outs then and some tam true up anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and the increased share count in 19 is that caused by options and the money or are you guys planning to raise equity david k holeman chief financial officer yes the share count assumes that the related to the additional dilutive impact of shares in 19 over what was out there today so it s not any assumption of raising additional shares anthony hau suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it thanks operator operator instructions we will now take our next question from john massocca of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst good morning james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer good morning john how are you john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst good so the 65 million of debt that you swapped out kind of subsequent to quarter end what was the rate on that david k holeman chief financial officer so it was so i think you are referring to pillarstone s debt that no longer is on our balance sheet that had kind of three pieces of debt the first one was two pieces of mortgage debt which are at i think roughly 26 million of it is in the 4 range 16 million of it is in the right at 5 and then the balance was the 6 million amount of whitestone which is roughly 4 john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst and then the kind of interest inaudible company loan between you and pillarstone what s the long term plan for that is that the you sell asset as the pillarstone sells assets to continue paying that off just any color you can provide there and how maybe that gets resolved going forward david k holeman chief financial officer sure i think as we created the original contribution involved about 15 million and 16 million of loan from whitestone to pillarstone that was paid down to approximately 6 million at the end of the year and we expect to continue to further to have that paid down and to further remove ourselves from the pillarstone assets john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst okay and is there anything other than the the kind of grocer moving out that you mentioned that is driving kind of the occupancy outlook going forward with any other tenants or anything maybe in the lease roll that s coming up here in 19 or you really see some expected move outs just any color there would be helpful david k holeman chief financial officer john i think as you guys all know our tenant mix is has a lot of diversity our largest tenant is about 3 so there is no so typically we renew a lot of tenants each year and then provide a lot ph activities but there s nothing in particular no large move outs we are expecting obviously in our portfolio we turn in a fair amount of portfolio each year john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst okay and then lastly maybe with regards to kind of your conversations with the sec is there anything maybe besides kind of the differing interpretation of the rules around pillarstone that kind of cause them to objects to how you are classifying personal for accounting reasons and just kind of thinking more as you go forward and you kind of examine the effectiveness of your controls over accounting is there anything else that was kind of highlighted or flagged that maybe we should know about or was it just pretty much simply this issue and there was a divergence in opinion as to what how technical difficulty for this entity david k holeman chief financial officer i think ultimately the company made a determination to involve judgement around the control yes we objected to that judgement and we are very clear on that and so there s really nothing else there as far as the evaluation of our controls we will clearly look at our controls over financial reporting and disclosures and a step whether they were affected john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst all right that s it for me thank you very much james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer all right thanks john operator we will now take our next question from anthony hau of suntrust please go ahead ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey this ki bin good morning everyone just wanted to make some comments about the sec and evaluating the control of them and disclosures i guess a couple of questions one is that 100 self evaluating or self policing on the accounting controls second is there ongoing is there going to be ongoing dialog or communication with sec regarding the other control david k holeman chief financial officer thanks ki bin obviously with i can t speak to the sec s actions going forward i m not aware of any ongoing dialog we would expect to have with the sec as far as the evaluation of control that is conducted by the company obviously participation of the executive officers in that is going as we like it ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and should we is there any impact to at previous quarter s ffo per share from the whole accounting reshuffling with pillarstone david k holeman chief financial officer there is not i think the impact is that that is it s small it s very very small impact to ffo so for the for the year there will be mitigated the impact of revenue and expenses to net income the impact for the previous three quarters of the year is nominal on a nominal on a dollar basis and very nominal on a share basis and it will be nominally accretive but very small ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and in terms of like just the background on the deal you guys sold i believe 20 of it but that was to the ceo and maybe a couple of board members at the end of the day when everything that s happened was it really worth it to do that kind of minor transaction david k holeman chief financial officer yes ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and i guess what was the overall goal david k holeman chief financial officer sure thanks for your question ki i think we have clearly communicated previously that transaction and the goals of whitestone i don t believe technical difficulty is going to give you some more time to go back and reimagine ph all those things that have been previously communicated and discussed james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer yes i d like to make a comment on that see ki bin i know we talked about this sometime ago and you ve always expressed an interest that you d like to see whitestone become a pure play so we had approached it that way of bringing getting whitestone to become a pure play without the nature of fire selling the assets because at the time we looked at the transaction they were valued relatively low and we didn t think that was fair to the whitestone shareholders to let that the profitability of those assets seep out of our hand so what we did is we want to investment bankers and they looked at all the strategic alternatives available to us and recommended that we could do a transaction like this with no future liability from whitestone by spinning off pillarstone assets like that and the future liability to adopt any of those assets really was in the hands of pillarstone which made it kind of a no risk situation with an we getting the best price out of it at the beginning of the transaction and then profiting further in 80 of the development risk the sec rulings brings us one stock close to becoming a pure play we now only have about 6 million left in debt that is owed to whitestone from pillarstone yet whitestone has 80 interest in all of the upside in pillarstone i hope that s helpful for you to understand it ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes that helpful and same store noi you mentioned the inaudible loss in the fourth quarter i m just curious how that is there any kind of follow on impact to co tenancy to other retailers in that center and how does that configure into your guidance if there is one david k holeman chief financial officer yeah there is no impact in community centered business center and i think as i communicated it was a low lower rent ground lease and so there s really no impact to any of the centers and the impact of that is all built into our guidance ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right thank you operator we will now take our next question from john massocca of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst just two quick kind of follow ups from me one is on the g a front understanding there is going to be some potential seasonal uptick in 1q is there also potential for maybe some kind of one time ish g a associated with kind of the examining of the effectiveness of controls and with the the dealing with the sec as you guys have kind of gone through here in 1q david k holeman chief financial officer well i think we ve commented that from a g a perspective obviously we have a commitment to continue to decrease that level as well as scale it and just say the first quarter typically had just a higher percentage of professional fees and accounting fees related to us audit those are a little higher this year probably that as a result of this but nothing material john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst and then the restatements didn t shouldn t have any impact on the credit facility you guys recut in 1q correct david k holeman chief financial officer that s right they the restatements had no impact on the credit facility or any of the covenants they were calculated in the same manner previously as they will be going forward john massocca ladenburg thalmann co analyst okay that s it from me thank you james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer thank you john operator there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to management for any additional or closing remarks james c mastandrea chairman and chief executive officer yes thank you operator and thank you all for joining us again i d just like to go back and say that 2018 was a solid year for us one that we had no less interest in driving the value of the portfolio than previous ones the distractions are time consuming as you all know and we were able to overcome that with our tenacity and skill and experience we have in terms of this business we re still remain very excited about our business model we think that it answers the questions to many of the concerns that people have about the consumers and we re starting to bring to our properties tenants with stronger balance sheet and also a longer work histories where they have opened up multiple locations with us so i thank you for your continued confidence and i think you re going to find 2019 to be very promising year for all of us and really do appreciate your consideration and the loyalty you ve given us in terms of being with us since our ipo of 2010 thank you operator operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect duration 42 minutes call participants kevin

by thomas mills politics nc february 26 2019 if democrats want to see large victories in 2020 they need to steal the narrative away from their left flank the new voice of the left wing of the party is alexandria ocasio cortez the 29 year old freshman congresswoman from the bronx is engaging articulate funny and everywhere in the media her green new deal has become a rallying point for the left and a litmus test for presidential contenders if democrats make the green new deal the centerpiece of their 2020 campaign strategy i suspect we should get comfortable having donald trump in the white house it s too complicated for most people to understand and most likely full of unintended consequences i ve read a bit about it and i still don t understand it i believe that climate change presents an existential threat and i also believe that our economic and tax systems disproportionally benefit the wealthy at the expense of the working class that said i don t believe the answer to either problem can be addressed in a single program that is more of slogan than a solution and i don t think most voters believe so either don t get me wrong i m not scared of government programs social security medicare and medicaid are foundations of our society that have helped people better their lives public schools community colleges and universities have offered people the tools to escape poverty and build better lives for their children we should support and expand on all of these programs i believe that addressing climate change requires government intervention now not later waiting on a free market solution is like waiting on the republican health care plan it s never going to happen we need to move away from reliance from fossil fuels and we won t do that without nudging from the government to both penalize polluters and reward developers of clean energy i believe in universal health care and i don t care how we get there whether it s a single payer program like medicare for all or revised version of obamacare that keeps private insurance an integral part of the delivery system i just know that every other developed country has a system that s less expensive and more efficient than ours and covers all their citizens i also know until we fix it health care will be the top domestic problem facing the country nobody wants to go broke because they get sick and they don t want to watch their loved ones die just because they can t afford treatment republicans still don t get that i believe that everybody should have access to higher education without taking on mortgage sized debt but i don t believe in free college for everybody i ve got no interest in letting my hard earned tax dollars subsidize millionaires to send their children to college that said i believe corporations should pay for community college education that serves as job training our government has a responsibility to ensure that our citizens have access to the tools to succeed in the 21stcentury economy i believe our embrace of supply side economics in the 1980s has led to the economic inequality we see today and has exacerbated the social turmoil that s rocking the country we created a system where winners win big and losers get left behind we reward those who live off of investments far more than we do those who work for wages we need to revise our tax structure to pay for the investments we need in energy infrastructure health care and education we don t however need to believe that the rich can pay for it all we need rely on economic growth that sees more people making more money not fewer people making a lot of money and paying less taxes on it we can t hide from globalization but we can make sure that our free trade policies are also fair trade policies when industries get wiped out like they did in the wake of nafta we should help ease the burden of communities that are affected by investing in infrastructure and education to attract new industries and jobs to those areas the big winners shouldn t always be investors and consumers while workers end up the big losers catchy names like the green new deal might excite activists and others predisposed to embracing change but they scare the hell out of folks for whom change is usually painful most voters aren t big idea people they re self interested what can you do for me people democrats should offer them hope for the future and a vision of what that looks like not some amorphous slogan that sounds like it s going to save the world
following a set of very weak chinese trade data at the end of 2018 it has been popular to portray china as being the epicentre of this slowdown in world growth we think that this view is overly simplistic we have been warning of a sharp slowdown in global trade for many months now and have also highlighted other risks including those from emerging markets mr slater said in our view the slowdown in global growth has been longer in the making than many observers think and results from a series of mutually reinforcing negative shocks the impact of some of these shocks has probably peaked but in other cases is still working its way through the system downwards pressure on world growth is likely to remain in place in the near term at least in a new comment amplifying global s greg gibbs said the chances that the rba cuts rates sooner rather than later got a boost from much weaker than expected construction work done figures on wednesday the data suggest that q4 gdp data will be significantly weaker than the rba s implied projection and leave year ended growth somewhat below trend he wrote the gdp report is due on wednesday a day after the rba monthly policy meeting a weak gdp outcome in q4 will only reinforce market pressure to act and make it harder for the rba to hold the line mr gibbs noted it must consider the broader risks to its forecasts and the weaker starting point for gdp related to the construction sector will boost the case to move closer to easing rates advertisement one potential brake on the rba is the continuing strength in the jobs market as strong employment growth might also be expected to help underpin household income and consumption growth if the rba does decide to provide more monetary stimulus judging by experience they are likely to be decisive and deliver two rate cuts over a few months as such there is room for rates to fall significantly further in the event that the rba signals an easing bias today s agenda local

shares and non gaap net income loss per ads as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america u s gaap the company defines non gaap income loss from operations as income loss from operations excluding share based compensation amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions revenue

progress purchase of intangible assets and land use rights the company defines non gaap ebitda as non gaap income loss from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions the company presents these non gaap financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans non gaap income loss from operations non gaap net income loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and non gaap ebitda reflect the company s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period to period comparisons free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from jd digits related credit

the use of the non gaap financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does if they so choose the company also believes that the non gaap financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses gain loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company s core operating results and business outlook the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools the company s non gaap financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures further these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited the company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to the nearest u s gaap performance measure all of which should be considered when evaluating performance the company encourages you to review the company s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure contacts investor relations

reconciliations of the most directly comparable gaap measures to non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews include adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share additionally we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates for example our ability to meet capital expenditures and working capital requirements and otherwise meet our obligations as they become due investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary information forward looking non gaap financial information is based on numerous assumptions including assumptions with respect to general business economic market regulatory and financial conditions and various other factors all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to cision many of which present non gaap measures when reporting their results these measures can be useful in evaluating our performance

revenue reduction from purchase accounting gains losses related to divested businesses or assets sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted ebitda are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding depreciation and amortization from ebitda users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 3 cision defines adjusted net income as net income loss plus provision for or minus benefit from income taxes further adjusted for acquisition and offering related costs gains losses related to divested businesses or assets stock based compensation deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting amortization related to acquired intangibles non recurring interest and losses on extinguishment of debt sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains which together sum to adjusted net income loss before income taxes adjusted net income loss before income taxes is then taxed at an assumed long term corporate tax rate of 33 for 2017 and periods prior and 26 for 2018 and beyond pursuant to our preliminary analysis with respect to recent u s tax law changes to determine adjusted net income the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017 resulted in a provisional net one time tax of 11 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects primarily from a tax on accumulated foreign earnings the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and new limitations on the deductibility of interest our calculation of adjusted net income excludes this provisional net one time tax we continue to finalize the analysis of the tax reform provisions in 2018 all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted net income are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding the amortization related to acquired intangibles users can compare operating performance without regard to highly variable amortization expenses related to our acquisitions in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 4 cision defines adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income as defined above divided by the fully diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding for the period the fully diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding for the respective period assume that the exchange of shares pursuant to our merger with capitol acquisition iii had taken effect as of the beginning of such period additionally for purposes of calculating

and stock options and restricted units issued and outstanding pursuant to our 2017 omnibus incentive plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we issued an aggregate of 6 342 989 ordinary shares 6

to have the opportunity to talk to all of you about our fourth quarter and year end results as usual i will start today s call with some highlights and then turn the call over to michael miller ibp s cfo who will discuss our results in more detail before we take your questions for 2018 ibp once again achieved record revenues earnings per share and adjusted ebitda in fact we have reported record results in each year since going public in 2014 since december 31st 2013 ibp has rapidly grown revenues from 432 million to a record 1 3 billion while our adjusted ebitda has increased nearly 500 to a record 164 4 million these accomplishments are a result of ibp s growth oriented business model disciplined acquisition strategy and the dedication and commitment of our employees across the us i m particularly proud of our performance during 2018 throughout the year the market environment and pricing dynamics within the insulation industry presented multiple challenges as we work through rapid price increases for our materials i appreciate our shareholders patience as we worked on offsetting the headwinds facing our business in 2018 i m pleased to report we ended the year with strong operating and financial momentum and i m excited by the opportunities for further growth in 2019 so let s look at the specific drivers of our business during 2018 and why we are so optimistic about our long term opportunities total revenues for 2018 increased 18 to more than 1 3 billion driven by greater volume favorable end customer and product growth and the 12 acquisitions completed this year single family same branch sales increased over 12 while total single family sales increased 20 compared to the increase in total us single family completions of 6 1 same branch multi family sales increased over 7 while total multi family sales increased approximately 9 during the 2018 fourth quarter ibp experienced a reacceleration in multi family growth as same branch multi family sales increased nearly 29 we believe this growth is a function of industry backlog conversion and not indicative of sustained demand combined new residential same branch sales during 2018 increased over 11 while total residential sales increased over 18 compared to the increase in total us completions of approximately 3 4 we continue to believe our focus on operating branches in strong and diverse us housing markets enhances opportunities and creates favorable position for ibp to outpace industry growth ibp s current geographic footprint provides us access to nearly 70 of total residential permits compared to 55 at december 31 2013 we remain committed to expanding our footprint through acquisitions organic branch growth and to capitalize on cross selling opportunities of other product offerings within our existing markets diversifying ibp s product mix allows us to provide more installation services to our customers expands our end markets and deepens our relationships with builders across the country at december 31 2018 approximately 66 of revenues were derived from insulation installation services compared to 74 of revenues five years ago acquisitions continue to play an important role in both our product and geographic expansion strategy as a result ibp installs a greater number of products serves multiple end markets and has a larger geographic footprint than ever before which we believe enhances our competitive position during 2018 we acquired approximately 83 million of annual revenue across multiple product lines and markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed three acquisitions including advanced fiber technology a manufacture of cellulose insulation and industrial fibers in bucyrus ohio with annual revenues of approximately 18 million carolina glass mirror inc a commercial and residential glass applications installer in north carolina with annual revenues of 6 2 million and hamilton benchmark inc a commercial fire stopping solutions installer in wisconsin with annual revenues of 1 3 million ibp has a strong platform of complementary businesses managed by experienced leaders our product offerings combined with our strong operating cash flow and our expanded credit facility provides us with significant resources and capital to continue to fund our accretive acquisition strategy the market for residential and commercial installation services remains highly fragmented our pipeline of potential acquisitions is robust and we believe 2019 will be another strong year of acquisition growth in addition to actively growing our business through accretive acquisitions our capital allocation includes the opportunistic repurchase of common stock i m pleased to announce that ibp returned over 89 million of capital back to shareholders through our stock repurchase program during the year we currently have 2 8 million shares of treasury stock with an average price of 37 28 per share we remain committed to creating value for our shareholders and we are focused on maximizing returns on capital i d now like to provide an update on the pricing environment for our installation services and the operational performance at alpha our large commercial installation business we have talked about the complex pricing and demand dynamics within the insulation industry throughout 2018 the increased demand for material to support industry growth as well as planned and unplanned downtime at manufacturing facilities impacted industry supply and supported manufacturer price increase strategies during 2018 as we stated last quarter we are putting a greater emphasis on our branch managers to align with customers that want partners like ibp who can deliver quality installation services on time and at a fair price we expect this alignment to enable us to better manage periods of material inflation improve our labor utilization and drive margin expansion across each of our product categories our price mix growth during the fourth quarter was 7 8 which is our strongest quarterly increase in price mix during 2018 and shows the progress we are making to increase our prices we continue to proactively work with our customers and suppliers to lessen the impact of rising material costs across all product lines and we expect further improvements during 2019 turning to alpha revenues increased 11 5 for 2018 and 13 during the fourth quarter i m pleased to report profitability continued to stabilize and during the fourth quarter operating expenses to support new locations improved as sales increased as these trends continue we expect profitability at these new branch locations to show further improvements organic geographic expansion continues to be a key component of our large commercial construction strategy we are opening a new alpha location in phoenix early this year and expect this location to quickly ramp given favorable trends within the region to wrap up my comments before turning the call over to michael i d like to review the impacts our financial wellness stock compensation and community engagement programs have had on our company and our employees as a result of these programs i m pleased to report ibp experienced improving employee retention rates in 2018 better retention rates produced significant benefit benefits across our organization they increased labor efficiency reduced training costs and improved employee morale i ve received numerous emails and hand written letters from employees thanking me and ibp for these programs through these initiatives we have positively impacted the lives families and communities of our hardworking local employees today more than 3 000 people have gained tools and knowledge through our financial wellness programs our performance and longevity based stock compensation program has been awarded to more than 1 000 employees who now enjoy the pride of ownership in ibp with our support numerous hours have been volunteered and financial resources have been donated to various organizations throughout our many ibp communities and we encourage our employees to support the local causes they believe are important we are dedicated to providing and promoting a strong employee first culture at ibp and i am proud and encouraged by the progress we are making in closing 2018 s financial results show the strength of ibp s platform as we look to the future we are excited by the opportunities we have to grow our geographic footprint increase our end market penetration and expand the products and services we offer residential and commercial builders we are focused on profitable growth which has produced significant improvements in net income and adjusted ebitda and drives compelling returns on invested capital and equity we are committed to creating value for shareholders and we ll continue to deploy our strong operating cash flow to make strategic acquisitions invest in our business and repurchase stock i m excited about our future and the opportunities we have to create value for our stockholders i would now like to turn the call over to michael to provide more details on our fourth quarter results michael wood nomura instinet analyst thank you jeff and good morning everyone for the full year our net sales increased 18 to 1 3 billion compared to 1 1 billion in the prior year which was mainly driven by higher volumes and pricing favorable end customer and end product mix and our 2018 acquisitions for the 2018 fourth quarter our revenue increased 17 8 to a record 353 1 million our same branch sales increased 11 1 due to favorable improvements in price and mix and an increase in volume our same branch d single family sales growth was 8 6 and our total new residential construction same branch sales increased 10 9 fourth quarter 2018 gross profit improved 21 3 to 98 6 million from 81 3 million in the prior year quarter adjusted gross profit as a percent of revenue was 27 9 compared to 28 1 for the same period last year based on seasonality within the business we would typically expect to see adjusted gross profit as a percent of revenue decline sequentially in the fourth quarter the 27 9 in the fourth quarter of 2018 is consistent with the third quarter predominantly as a result of the timing of material cost increases and our customer pricing initiative i m pleased to report on the labor side of cost of goods sold we continue to experience lower turnover and better retention and productivity rate these improvements are a direct result of the investments we ve been making to attract retain and motivate our workforce and we will continue investing in our employee benefit program for the 2018 fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue improved to 18 7 as compared to 19 2 for the 2017 period as a percentage of revenues administrative expenses were 13 7 in the fourth quarter compared to 13 9 for the same period last year adjusted selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue improved by 50 basis points from 18 5 to 18 we expect selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue to continue to improve over time as we further scale our operations and benefit from increased sales as we have stated in previous earning calls it is important to note that as our acquisition strategy continues and as the volume of total acquired business operations become larger we will incur additional non cash amortization expense in the fourth quarter we recorded 5 7 million of amortization expenses compared to 7 1 million for the same period last year this non cash technical difficulty adjustment impacted net income which is why we continue to believe that adjusted ebitda is the most useful measure of profitability based on our acquisition completed to date we expect first quarter 2019 amortization expense of approximately 5 9 million and full year expense of approximately 23 3 million this figure will change with any subsequent acquisitions for the full year we improved our adjusted ebitda to a record 164 4 million representing an increase of 16 5 from 141 1 million in the prior year and our adjusted ebitda margin was 12 3 for the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda improved to 43 6 million representing an increase of 20 5 from 36 2 million in the prior year as a percent of that revenue our adjusted ebitda was 12 4 in the fourth quarter compared to 12 1 in the prior year quarter our same branch incremental adjusted ebitda margin benefited from stabilizing gross margins and operating leverage and for the 2018 fourth quarter it was 15 5 compared to 8 4 for the same period last year this is the highest same branch incremental adjusted ebitda margin we have achieved for any quarter in 2018 and demonstrates our initiatives to improve profitability on a gaap basis our fourth quarter net income was 16 5 million or 0 54 per diluted share compared to net income of 10 8 million or 0 34 per diluted share in the prior year quarter our adjusted net income improved to 21 8 million or 0 72 per diluted share compared to 16 6 million or 0 52 per diluted share in the prior year quarter for 2018 our effective tax rate was approximately 24 2 and we expect a full year effective tax rate of 25 to 27 for 2018 now moving onto our balance sheet and cash flow for the 12 month period ending december 31st 2018 we generated 96 6 million in cash flow from operations compared to 68 8 million in the prior year a 40 5 increase we continue to use our strong operating cash flow to fund acquisitions reinvest in our business and repurchase our shares capital expenditures at december 31st 2018 were 35 2 million while total incurred capital leases were 2 2 million capital expenditures and incurred capital leases as a percent of revenue decreased 40 basis points to 2 8 at december 31st 2018 compared to the same period last year at december 31st 2018 we had total cash and short term investment of 100 5 million compared to 92 6 million at december 31st 2017 during the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 1 3 million shares of our common stock for a total price of approximately 46 5 million for the year we ve repurchased approximately 2 1 million shares for a total price of approximately 89 4 million we have approximately 61 million available in our expanded 150 million stock repurchase program total debt at december 31st 2018 was approximately 463 million taking into account cash and short term investments at december 31st 2018 our net total debt was approximately 363 million compared to 267 million it s december 31st 2017 our capital structure remains conservative and we have considerable flexibility as we continue to deliver on our growth strategy with that i will now turn the call back to jeff for closing remarks jeff edwards president chief executive officer thanks michael ibp has a strong platform a disciplined approach and an experienced team i am encouraged by our record results and our opportunities to grow and create value for our stockholders in 2019 and beyond operator let s open up the call for questions questions and answers operator at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of nishu sood with deutsche bank please proceed with your question nishu sood deutsche bank analyst thank you first question i wanted to ask was about the price mix obviously a very strong number at nearly 8 the turmoil that began in terms of insulation pricing at the beginning of 18 you have talked about it taking through part of part of 19 maybe even all of 19 to get back to kind of equilibrium in terms of your input cost versus your pricing to your customers so it looks like you made some pretty good progress in 18 obviously based on that i m sorry in 4q based on that 8 number where are we generally in terms of catching up and getting to an equilibrium there just a rough sense of that please michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer hey nishu this is michael as you can probably tell from our prepared comments and having a bit of a cold so sorry if i don t come across very clearly but yes we did make very good progress in the fourth quarter which we were pleased with but as we noted in the third quarter we expect to continue to make further progress as we go through 19 and that continues to be the case so we re continuing to make sure that we re as jeff said in his prepared comments that we re working with customers that are willing to pay us a fair price for our services and fully get back to as you referred to at that equilibrium between price cost and selling price to our customers jeff edwards president chief executive officer and i guess this is jeff nishu but i guess to further clarify or make even a little more of a point on it i don t consider our price and our margins at the beginning of 18 to even be equilibrium i mean quite frankly we ve been playing catch up really since the price increases have started just because we took three last year there was at least a couple for multiple years before that so this idea of playing catch up existed even at the beginning of 18 so i would consider what we re after is something better than what we started with to be honest with you michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer absolutely nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it and the well recognized turmoil in the residential market i think it makes the progress you ve made in price mix stand out even more can you give us your general sense of how the volatility in the residential new residential and market affects your ability to get back to equilibrium i think the general investor perception might be that it would make the task a little bit more difficult your 4q number obviously argues against that but how does that complicate or perhaps ease the process of getting back to equilibrium on price versus input costs jeff edwards president chief executive officer well clearly we can t ignore that kind of macro environment that s there but quite frankly we feel very good about the continued demand environment we re seeing clearly as is very well noted publicly that the builders are making a strong pivot toward a more affordable home which means more volume it also means shorter cycle times and it also means more specs so there still quite a bit of backlog in single family work to work on and we re encouraged by the pivot the builders are making and also the very early signs that the indications that we re seeing from the spring selling season but fundamentally as you know because we spent quite a bit of time talking about it we have been positioning the business for a pause or a slight slowdown in the rate of growth in new single family construction by diversifying the product offerings that we have to our new single family construction customers but also on the commercial side of the business so we really have been building and preparing for however you want to characterize what s going on in the market now for really 18 to 24 months now and we feel very confident about our ability to continue to perform and deliver good returns for our shareholders nishu sood deutsche bank analyst right and the 18 growth you saw in commercial projects in 4q 18 certainly obviously reflects that diversification how does that compare that 18 to the underlying market rate of growth and what do you expect for 2019 on the commercial side michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer so nishu just to clarify for the full year our total sales growth was 18 and in the quarter our total sales growth was 17 8 but the growth at alpha was 13 in the quarter and 11 5 for the full year so as you know we don t provide guidance but alpha has continued to grow at an organic rate similar to our same branch sales growth and we feel given the backlog of business that we have within the alpha business we continue to feel good about its ability to grow at a good clip as you full well know because its commercial business and there are long term contracts we have greater visibility into what their revenue picture is going to look like than we might in some of the other businesses so we feel good about that business s ability to perform in 19 as we ve mentioned in previous calls the profitability there has been a little bit lower than our expectations because of the branch start up costs that we ve been incurring but we did make good progress in the fourth quarter of 18 both from a revenue and a profitability perspective at that business but we still have work to do in 19 and as we previously have said we believe we ll continue to see improvement going through 19 with that business jeff edwards president chief executive officer technical difficulty in both business both the residential side and the commercial side there s plenty of market opportunity for us to run the playbook that we ve set out for us nishu sood deutsche bank analyst got it great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet please proceed with your question michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning first are you able to quantify for us the headwinds to profit in fourth quarter from price cost and the new alpha branch investments that you re making michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer so when we ve talked about it in the past and talked about on an annual basis of being 1 million to 1 05 million ph the headwinds in the fourth quarter for the new branches was significantly less than that there were still some headwinds associated with it but it was significantly less than that on a quarterly basis and as i just said we feel good that we re getting positive momentum not just in the organic business if you will or the legacy branches but also that the new branches are getting up to a scale where they ll get to a profitability that we find acceptable so the drag was there was definitely a drag there but it wasn t nearly as significant as it was in the second or third quarter michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay and on the residential organic growth side are you able to give us some idea of where the organic growth rates are in some of the non insulation products in fourth quarter like blinds waterproofing just some of the major categories maybe directionally commenting on it or a range michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer so we ve seen pretty good balance i would say in terms of growth of the various product lines we definitely have seen i would say stepped up growth in the blinds business that we ve as we ve talked about it but we ve really seen good balance through the various products and that really is continuing to perform and execute on our strategy of cross selling those other products to our insulation customers so we are making the progress that we ve been talking about for the past several quarters and we hope that that s going to continue or would expect that that would continue through 19 michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you jeff edwards president chief executive officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of mike eisen with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question michael eisen rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer sure michael eisen rbc capital markets analyst just wanted to start off and looking at what the builders have talked about and you guys mentioned the volatility and pressure they ve seen how should we think about the potential for some organic sales declines in 19 and if that is likely to happen or possible to happen how should we think about the decrementals in the business with volumes down michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer this is michael i would say that we our internal view at this point when we re looking at a full year 19 is that volumes will still continue to be positive for the overall industry i think we ve done a very good job of demonstrating our ability to grow at a rate above the industry so we would absolutely not expect there to be any decline and we re very confident in our ability to again use the other products and some of the other commercial business to help offset any temporary weakness there might be in the new single family side jeff edwards president chief executive officer and that s separate and apart obviously from our price increase strategy and continue to try to kind of sort through our customers to make sure we re doing work for the customers that are willing to pay us what we should get paid a fair price michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer and i think it was clear from the fourth quarter results is that right now we re not emphasizing volume we re emphasizing quality of customer and quality of margin michael eisen rbc capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and encouraging and then following up on that jeff you also made the comment about a strong push from the builders to mix down to smaller and more affordable products when thinking about the different moving pieces in the price bucket including the size of the homes the additional products you re putting in how much of the price expectation of getting back to equilibrium is strictly talking about the insulation product as opposed to your overall share of wallet from the builders michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer that s actually a great point because you re right it s not just installation that we re talking about it really is all the products because the material price inflation that i think everybody saw in 18 was cross again all the products so we re working on pricing on everything that we sell to the builder and it s not a question of just making up share of wallet it s a question of getting higher selling prices and a fair selling price for the products that we are installing jeff edwards president chief executive officer absolutely well and i d say that as it relates to our portfolio of products for the most part as we ve referred to them before and we ve kind of i guess referred to them at times as nuisance products but we love that word we love the word nuisance even though it has a negative connotation but at the end of the day most of the services and products that we provide to the builders are of a de minimis amount in the scheme of the total price of the house now that s not to say that we shouldn t be encouraging and rewarding our sales people for doing their job and getting out there and getting with the builder and getting it done but at the same time we re not talking about typically thousands and thousands of dollars of price increase that are associated with some of the other trades that would need to accomplish the same things in the house michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer and i think it s key too as the builder makes this pivot to the more entry level home cycle times do shorten and getting the house done on time becomes even more important so we become we believe more important to the builder particularly because we ve done quite frankly such an excellent job on the labor side improving productivity improving our turnover and really having the labor to get the jobs done and get them done on time and i think again it s been widely discussed with investors and with yourselves that the builders that are going to win are the builders that have the houses ready to sell very quickly because an entry level buyer is not going to wait around six months for a house michael eisen rbc capital markets analyst got it very helpful and if i can sneak in one more with the comments of the new branch in phoenix i think that brings you guys to six organic greenfield branches on the commercial side can you help us think about when thinking 13 growth in the quarter what the legacy alpha branches did and how we should think about the growth rates from the new branches michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we haven t broken that out and part of the reason is and i think we ve talked about this on previous calls is because that business can be very lumpy at a local level at a branch level particularly on a quarterly basis and it s just we think it would take away from the clarity of the picture we re trying to present michael eisen rbc capital markets analyst understood thanks for all the information jeff edwards president chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of phil ng with jefferies please proceed with your question maggie jefferies analyst good morning everyone this is maggie ph on for phil i just wanted to dig into the supply and demand dynamics in the industry either what you re seeing currently or what you re expecting this year i guess based on recent commentary about one of your competitors moving supplier around and one of the manufacturers shuttering capacity this year so i guess what the implications are for pricing and what you re expecting this year jeff edwards president chief executive officer i guess though in a broad brush manner i d still say that insulation material fiber glass that is remains still tight and from a capacity perspective pretty highly utilization rates are pretty high so i don t know that we are in a vastly different position than we were in prior years as you might remember last year there was an unexpected as one of our my colleagues would call it a catastrophic failure i think is what has been referred to in a inaudible plant that kind of threw the market into a bit of a tizzy and a tighter spot than would have been otherwise i don t think anybody anticipates that happening again although that s i guess the nature of something that you don t expect but in general i would say it s not markedly different than it s been from a capacity and utilization perspective maggie jefferies analyst okay go ahead jeff edwards president chief executive officer so i was going to say as you know that and we talk about this for the past five years we maintain a great relationship with all four of the manufacturers and we think that s a key strategy and we re going to continue to do that they know that we are here to support them and they are here to support us as well maggie jefferies analyst and how does the advanced fiber acquisition play into that now that you own some of that cellulose manufacturing capacity or is that an easy substitute fiberglass and have you seen fiberglass insulation driving more demand growth in cellulose jeff edwards president chief executive officer yes there has been more demand growth in cellulose because it is a substitute for fiberglass and given that fiberglass pricing has increased so significantly it s a logical substitute but i mean there s still cellulose capacity is nothing like the fiberglass capacity that s out there you can add sales capacity faster than fiberglass capacity but it still takes some time so cellulose is still sort of a niche product to some extent but it s definitely an alternative and it s definitely a good counterbalance to kind of fiberglass particularly lose fill capacity utilization on the fiberglass side maggie jefferies analyst got it and if i could sneak one more in just on your incremental they ve been lagging that 20 to 25 target range over the last few quarters and definitely being mindful of the cost inflation in 2018 but i guess what has to change or what levers do you have to pull to get incrementals back to that long term range is it just pricing or is there labor efficiencies anything like that thanks michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we still feel very confident that we ll get back to the 20 to 25 but again i need to reiterate that it is not something that we expect on a quarterly basis particularly in the first half of the year it is typically a back half of the year opportunity for us and on a full year basis but clearly as we talked about in the third quarter and then on this call we re still getting on top of the price increases and trying to realize more stronger price mix from our customers and as we said in the third quarter of last year we expect that to continue to go into 19 as we do today continue to expect that to go into 19 and believe as we get into the back half of next year we feel more confident about our ability to return to those levels jason niswonger senior vice president finance and investor relations i mean it is predominantly pricing but with the decrease in turnover at the employee level and predominantly at the store level that we ve been able to kind of shepherd fully we expect that to start to contribute to toward helping us return to kind of more acceptable and historical margins jeff edwards president chief executive officer we feel very very good about it i mean probably the best we ve felt in a long time about our labor situation not that it s not something we re working on every single day and that as you know is definitely one of the greatest challenges of this business but our team is just doing an excellent job and they really use the tools that we ve given them from a employee wellness perspective to we believe increase significantly employee engagement and employee retention maggie jefferies analyst wonderful thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of susan maklari with credit suisse please proceed with your question susan maklari credit suisse analyst good morning jeff edwards president chief executive officer good morning susan maklari credit suisse analyst the first question is and kind of building on your comments just now in response to maggie s question but obviously as you ve gone for price you still really held onto your share can you talk to how some of the efforts you have made on the labor side the lower turnover the productivity how is that helping your branch managers to have these conversations is it perhaps making them more productive than they otherwise would have been jeff edwards president chief executive officer i think that s very fair statement to be honest with you i mean the idea is you have a finite to a degree at least resource or on top of it more than maybe the competitor might be on the labor side it s certainly emboldens your conversation in terms of the price to get the job done and quite frankly if they and it s not uncommon actually for us sometimes to give up a little bit of work to have them try another contractor that might be a little less expensive who is not quite in the same position only to return back to us later when they are stumbling or struggling so it absolutely does help a manager or a sales person to go have that conversation and knowing that the services is going to be required elsewhere if it s not with that single building ph michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer the consistency in productivity knowing that the labor force is there and that it s going to get the job done absolutely gives us a lot of confidence when we re talking to our customers and i d add to that with the managers being less focused we re spending fewer hours on trying to get labor not only helps time for selling but it also helps with other products and just overall branch profitability in terms of leveraging those costs we have in these facilities susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay all right that s very helpful and my second question is and i know that you oftentimes don t like to talk about the weather but just given the a verity of some of the weather that we have seen this winter and especially with your focus in the midwest is there anything that you are seeing in terms of maybe delays or any other kind of changes that we should be thinking about going into the spring jeff edwards president chief executive officer susan it s been pretty modest i mean as you know we can work weekends to make up for lost time or times when we can t get to the job sites and i think you might see just some small delays coming later in the year but it s nothing significant nothing that we re hearing people complaining about susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay all right that s good thank you guys jeff edwards president chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of trey morrish with evercore please proceed with your question james morrish evercore analyst thanks and great job guys on the quarter especially on that price cost dynamic and sticking with that lot of people are talking about the material cost inflation but i wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you re seeing cost inflation shape up for freight and your labor component looking into 2019 michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer labor as we ve said i think a couple of times we feel very good about it and our ability to continue to improve our labor efficiencies that s not to say that people aren t going to get paid more it s just that we have more productive people get paid more money but they are also more efficient from our perspective in terms of providing just more efficient and better labor percentages for us in terms of the freight costs i mean i think that clearly there was a big ramp up in 18 associated with those i don t think we or the market expects really a significant change from sort of where we are at this point and keep in mind our manufacturers do pay the transportation costs for our products and we really don t expect to see anything significant significantly different i would say in 19 around that jeff edwards president chief executive officer well we ve been fighting that s maybe argumentative word but fighting the freight rising price environment for a lot longer than even the last 12 months it s probably been around 24 to 36 anyway so it s typically dealt with the surcharge from the manufacturers and it s not all that significant in terms of the surcharge and i should i mean it is any cost increase is significant but it s not double digits michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer the material price inflation is more of the issue is the issue james morrish evercore analyst okay thanks for that and then looking back over to alpha with such a strong performance in the quarter you are not really breaking out organic i wonder if you could help us think about how pricing in the commercial business is moving is that i m assuming it s rising but at a less rate than what you re seeing on the residential price mix so just how to think about that part of the business directionally jeff edwards president chief executive officer as you know within that business every job is bid so it s very job specific but i would say that i mean two things just fundamentally in that business material as a percentage of the cost of a job is lower than it is in installation or in our other products and they also have not experience as much material price inflation as we have in particularly the fiberglass side james morrish evercore analyst okay thanks very much jeff edwards president chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens please proceed with your question noah merkousko stephans analyst this is noah merkousko on for trey grooms jeff edwards president chief executive officer hi noah merkousko stephans analyst so i kind of wanted to follow up on your discussion of higher selling prices you saw in the quarter how much of this was due to mix and then looking forward into 2019 can you talk about what impact you think mix would have on that michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer as you know we don t break out the difference between price and mix and as you do know that our other products that we talk about on the residential side selling they do reduce the price mix because their average selling price is less than installation so we feel very good about the progress we ve made in the fourth quarter and as we ve said earlier in the call we still have room to grow and we re continuing to work through 19 to make sure that we get again a fair price for the quality of the service that we re providing noah merkousko stephans analyst okay that s helpful and then my follow up just how are you thinking about demand in 2019 i know we ve talked about the sentiment has improved on the buyer side but at the same time we ve seen starts continue to trend lower on a year over year basis so how are you thinking about that and maybe the cadence of that impact from starts jeff edwards president chief executive officer again just looking at the macro data and looking at order growth that the builders are disclosing i mean when they come out with their fourth quarter numbers clearly i think it points to a tougher first half than i think the second half because what we re seeing now and the forward indicators that we are getting versus the backward indicators that we re getting seem to be pretty positive from the builders so i mean this year might be a little bit lumpier than others for the industry as a whole as we said previously in the call we re working hard to offset any kind of weaknesses out there within the builder community that s what we ve been working on for the past 18 to 24 months in terms of diversifying the business so we feel we re prepared for it we also know i mean you ve looked at the numbers and again i think we re all skeptical about the census bureau numbers just given the timing of them coming out and the government shutdown but the backlog in single family in december was that is permits to authorize but not started was the highest than all year so there are homes to be worked on as we start getting into the spring selling season and clearly as we ve said several times in the call that the product that s being shifted to have a shorter cycle time and will get completed sooner so we think the demand environment at least from what we re seeing continues to be constructive and we are encouraged noah merkousko stephans analyst thanks that s helpful i ll jump back in queue jeff edwards president chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of justin speer with zelman associates please proceed with your question justin speer zelman associates analyst thanks guys just a follow up question for me i have a couple of questions but the price cost you mentioned you were lagging i think something like 4 to 5 million last quarter and i know you mentioned something here earlier on the call but i want to make sure i understand it how much are you lagging do you think into the fourth quarter with what you have in hand now michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer honestly we didn t quantify it for this quarter it s definitely there but obviously given the strength that we saw in the price mix it s diminishing but it s still there and we still have opportunity or we still have room to go in terms of getting back to as nishu had referred toward equilibrium justin speer zelman associates analyst so with the tightness still in capacity and a large manufacturer curtailing more in terms of 2018 there were three price increases and i think there was an announcement before january for another increase i guess what s your view on just the cadence of pricing in view of what is a softer volume backdrop to start the year and then following on that is how does that play into your negotiations with your customers as you try to push that price through michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer yes as jeff said earlier the capacity utilization is still high so we would expect that 19 there is price realization for sure from the manufacturers and it s important for us and we re having those conversations with our customers now to make sure that we can stay on top of it but we don t expect it to be anything like what we experienced in 18 in terms of the number of increases and the rigidity of the increases out there jeff edwards president chief executive officer the backdrop from a manufacturer perspective is not exactly the same as it was obviously in 18 but it still remains tight from utilization perspective but again i ll just go back to the idea that there is plenty of market opportunity for us as a company out there in the marketplace to run our playbook and to stick with our plan justin speer zelman associates analyst i guess big picture i think everyone s just trying to figure this thing out do you think that you can expand margins if you have this kind of tough first half better back half i mean seasonally it s important for the back half to be better but do you think you are going to expand margins in 2019 jeff edwards president chief executive officer absolutely justin speer zelman associates analyst then one more question for me jeff edwards president chief executive officer it s conviction around getting paid what you should get paid for the services you re providing and i think our company down to the sales person and managers i think they believe that statement and they should it s not an easy business for what we get paid traveling three times out to a house to make on average 2 500 or so on an insulation job it s and to do that on time and pass inspection frankly we should be rewarded michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and when we say that we think of it in the context of the full year justin speer zelman associates analyst right that s exactly what i m looking for and then last question for me on this commercial business because it s tucked in here i appreciate you giving us the revenue numbers but in terms could you characterize what the full year margin was for alpha and where that destination is as we look to 2019 and beyond that d be very helpful as well michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer so it s as we ve talked about it s still below our expectations but it is incremental to the business so i mean it s still a very attractive business for us and we re pleased with the investment we ve made there and we think long term that it has the ability like the rest of the business to get back to sort of that mid teens ebitda margin that we ve talked about and we believe we will get there justin speer zelman associates analyst do you think you ll be there by 2019 or do you think it will take a little bit longer to get there michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer so we ve already talked about it in the context of once we reach stabilization particularly in the single family side and i don t think anybody is expecting we re going to be at stabilization in single family in 19 justin speer zelman associates analyst no i understand i m talking about for the commercial business it took a step back in 18 from 17 but that mid teens bogey and that destination that you re looking for is that are you in spitting distance of that in 2019 or do you think it s going to take longer to get to that mid teens number michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say we would expect to be going in spitting distance with that but we believe that that business can even improve beyond that and we are going to continue to make these investments in organic branches and through acquisitions and all that stuff is just continuing to build that business and we believe making those investments are absolutely the right thing to do to create shareholder value long term justin speer zelman associates analyst thanks and i will leave the balance of my questions for a follow up appreciate it jeff edwards president chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust please proceed with your question josh aycox suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi this is josh on for keith so just follow up on some general topics discussed in 2019 do you see mix inside the insulation business changing at all given the shift to kind of more affordable homes jeff edwards president chief executive officer i mean certainly the affordable home product is a fiberglass cellulose product and not spray foam product so there is no doubt that that shift will continue to be fiberglass but keep in mind the shift that everybody is talking about is really heavily weighted toward the production builders making that shift and they were fiberglass installer or fiberglass buyers anyway as opposed to spray foam with the exception of meritage so i don t think you re seeing necessarily or going to see necessarily a huge shift within fiberglass and spray foam i do think you re seeing slightly greater spray foam adoption in some product lines and as a consequence the market is seeing good spray foam growth and particularly as it becomes somewhat more cost competitive with fiberglass josh aycox suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great jeff edwards president chief executive officer and it s incremental it s not this is not a sea change where all of a sudden spray foam is going to be in our opinion bigger than fiberglass josh aycox suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great it and i think you mentioned earlier the other products that would be a negative mix just because the average selling price is a little bit less is there any expectation for growth profile to be different there than the insulation business that would cause some negative mix versus the pricing you re getting on the installation side michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we ve talked about this in previous quarters i mean part of the strategy particularly in a softer demand environment is clearly for us to aggressively more aggressively cross sell those products to our existing customers and that definitely has negative impact on price mix as we ve talked about for quite a while but as our numbers would indicate we ve been successful in offsetting that by improving our customer mix who we are doing business with and improving our average selling prices josh aycox suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great that s all i have thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kenneth zener with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning gentlemen jeff edwards president chief executive officer good morning ken kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst couple of questions here last year in the fourth quarter when the incrementals started slowing down you guys were very clear about alpha being the driver of that i think in the second quarter you talked about how you re hitting those normalized incrementals on the installation business ex alpha so it sounds like you re talking about the improvements right the year over year incrementals improved from 8 to 15 and at the time i think it was last quarter or the quarter before you talked about the gap being related to alpha your incrementals and came to the 3 million or 500 000 ph a branch that really seems at the time you talked about that s deciding by kind of mid 19 there s nothing that s changed regarding your prior comments is there regard in regards to new greenfields or anything else like that jason niswonger senior vice president finance and investor relations again this is jason the communication that we had probably in the second quarter was consistent about alpha and the impact it had in the quarter again i think largely we feel that alpha has done a great job of getting these new branches up to a reasonable level of profitability that it s not been something that s really been a big impact on incrementals or profitability there is still work to do in terms of making those meet the expectations that we have but it s not been a sizable drag on what we reported in the third quarter and fourth quarter kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst okay good jason niswonger senior vice president finance and investor relations and it s consistent with exactly what we said in the second and third quarter we re continuing to see improvement continuing to see improvement in alpha we are continuing to see improvement in our price mix we re doing exactly what we said we ve been doing kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst good a question isolating just looking at your slide deck if you were to exclude commercial so any foam and commercial businesses what s your residential installation split between fiberglass and foam in terms of units and value i mean is it 10 of volumes 20 of value just trying to get a sense there when i look at it jason niswonger senior vice president finance and investor relations i m going to answer part of that question very specifically our new single family spray foam volume dollar volume is about 15 of our new single family installation volume i m not going to give you units because units we use as a sort of a general kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst that s fine don t worry about it i just wonder i know you guys were referencing this 1 point to 2 points of growth in single family and clearly spring is developing i would say all the flowers they re going to come they not out put it mildly and i am in california so when do you look at it if you take the government data because you have per your deck 20 share of new single family installs but for another competitor you probably have the best real time data in the country and it was a really bad start number in december which is probably flawed government data but i mean if you look at it saying starts lag 90 days they are down about 6 i think december s data is probably wrong just because of the collection process but it does point in any case to a down unit outlook and you lag starts 90 days and i know you guys bring in completions a little bit but if it was negative in the first quarter would that actually surprise you or do you think that s just crazy based upon what you re seeing i know you referred to backlog for permits but i mean you have pretty good visibility into real data versus what the government is alleging i mean is that government s data state appear to be wrong and it is negative casting starts lag 90 days jeff edwards president chief executive officer i mean i think we are overall skeptical about the monthly data from the census bureau right we talked about that a lot because it gets revised significantly and often we continue to feel very good about the year i mean from a macro perspective exclusive of ibp i mean could you see negative numbers coming in the first and second quarter of 19 yes do we feel i mean we re two thirds of the way through the quarter and we obviously have a lot of boots on the ground that we feel very good about kind of our ability to perform through any kind of a soft patch absolutely kenneth zener keybanc capital markets analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of matt mccall with seaport global securities please proceed with your question matthew mccall seaport global securities analyst thank you good morning jeff edwards president chief executive officer matt how are you matthew mccall seaport global securities analyst great thank you so back to price cost i just wanted to make sure i understood it sounds like there s going to be continued pressure in h1 consistent with what you said before opportunity in the second half does that opportunity in second half what does it incorporate from an incremental pricing action perspective in the first half of 19 jeff edwards president chief executive officer it includes us continuing to make progress as we have in the fourth quarter with our customers and we obviously as you know don t provide guidance so we haven t talked about any specific numbers that we would expect to get from a price perspective matthew mccall seaport global securities analyst okay but does it assume are you basically catching up from last year s price or are we i guess the question i m asking is is it the new pricing actions that manufacturers push out that potential pressures as you guys have to catch up from 19 pricing actions jeff edwards president chief executive officer yeah i would as i think we may not have said it clearly but as i think we ve sort of indicated both in the third quarter call and in our answers to some of the previous questions is that the capacity within the fiberglass industry continues to be high i think while the inflationary environment in 19 is much more benign than it was in 18 it s still there and we still have work to do in terms of getting on top of 18 s inflation so we re working on both getting on top of 18 s inflation and albeit at a more benign level in 19 on top of that as well it is a constant working and crafting of making sure that our customers are willing to pay us the fair price for our services matthew mccall seaport global securities analyst and i think last quarter michael you talked about if you exclude the price cost pressure you would have been within your targeted incremental ebitda margin range was that the case in q4 as well michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer yes matthew mccall seaport global securities analyst okay and then final question you ve established a trend here on the sg a leverage front 80 90 basis points last couple of years how do we think about that going forward and i guess a lot of it depends on the volume but how do we think about your outlook for sg a leverage in 19 and 20 just broadly michael miller executive vice president and chief financial officer we continue to believe that we ll make progress and maybe not at the same rate that we ve been making progress at but we continue to believe we ll make progress in getting that leverage one of the keys obviously is on a companywide basis is the pace at which we do acquisitions because obviously acquisitions bring on with them g a expenses as well matthew mccall seaport global securities analyst okay thank you jason niswonger senior vice president finance and investor relations i d like to

on china trade negotiation us trade representative robert lighthizer laid down the principle that the us can compete with anyone in the world but he emphasized we must have rules enforced rules and market outcomes rather than state capitalism and technology theft determine winners china s unfair trade practices are major threats to our economy lighthizer said there were very intense extremely serious and very specific negotiation with china on crucial structural issues for several months and real progress were made us could turn the corner in the economic relationship with china if they can reach a satisfactory solution to the all important outstanding issue of enforceability as well as some other concerns but much still needs to be done before an agreement is reached and more importantly after it is reached he also emphasized that the administration is pressing for significant structural changes rather than soybean solution the us is very aware of the history with china and the disappointments that have resulted from promises that were not kept and the reality is this is a challenge that will go on for a long long time he added that if there is disagreement at my level the u s would expect to act proportionately but unilaterally meanwhile as the agreements are settlements of china s violations of section 301 of the trade act of 1974 so they are executive actions that do not require congress approval china talks are more in common with a sanctions monitoring regime than a traditional trade pact fed powell balance runoff likely settles at around 16 17

mezey philip mezey thank you ken good afternoon and thank you for joining us we have a lot to cover today so let s get started we ended 2018 with q4 performance as expected while also operating our first full quarter under our new segments of device solutions network solutions and outcomes you will hear details for joan in a moment but to highlight our q4 2018 performance revenue was 587 million adjusted ebitda was 59 million adjusted non gaap eps of 0 88 was above our guidance due to one time favorable tax items and we had another strong quarter of free cash flow performance of 25 million customer pipeline continues to be healthy with the q4 book to bill ratio of just over 1 3 1 we ended 2018 with a book to bill ratio of greater than 1 1 our total backlog at the end of the year was a record 3 17 billion and our 12 months backlog was 1 35 billion as i ll reflect on this past year while we made tremendous progress in many areas of the business we also had mixed financial results we encountered unexpected headwinds both internal and external in our supply chain which resulted in lower revenue and profitability than we expected in terms of strategy execution we gained strong market momentum which will lead to long term value for our customers and our investors first we strengthened our position as the industrial internet of things leader in the smart energy and smart cities space with the acquisition of silver spring networks this acquisition allowed us to extend our software and services capability deeper into solutions such as distribution automation and smart street lighting by expanding our product portfolio this allows us to offer our customers end to end support in navigating the evolving complexity of their business environment as a combined company we have delivered over 200 million one and two way communicating endpoints with over 60 million under our active management we are one of the largest providers of connected streetlights and have some of the largest cellular deployments for advanced metering making us one of the largest industrial iot companies in the world to strengthen our leadership position long term we introduced the technology roadmap that merges two world class networks and leaves no customer behind our customers will have the ability to securely and efficiently manage the proliferation of devices sensors and intelligent end point all on our platform we worked with partners to increase our reach through network standards like ysen nbiot 5g and other transport technologies to ensure seamless operational capabilities for our customers we continue to prioritize organic investments that will drive higher margin software and services deeper into our footprint of connected devices these efforts will enable our customers to successfully manage their operation information and consumer engagement needs for decades to come finally we are laser focused on our commitment to expanding gross margin and executing on our operational cost improvements we made tremendous strides on our committed restructuring and integration plans by achieving over 70 million in cumulative savings through the end of 2018 and we expect to deliver the 440 million in cumulative savings by 2020 we are pleased with the progress on our strategy and look forward to the year ahead i will now hand off to joan to discuss the full 4q results and our 2019 guidance joan hooper thank you philip before i discuss our fourth quarter results let me remind you that this is our first quarter reporting under the realigned business segments of device solutions networked solutions and outcomes we held an informational call on february 21st to review historical results for these new segments as philip mentioned fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations a summary of consolidated gaap results is shown on slide 7 and non gaap results are shown on slide 8 revenue of 587 million increased 7 versus last year driven by strong performance in the networked solutions segment and the acquisition of silver spring networks fourth quarter gross margin of 30 1 was lower than last year primarily due to a higher special warranty cost in 2018 moving to earnings per share fourth quarter gaap net income was 24 million or 0 60 per diluted share compared with 2 billion or 0 05 cents last year you may recall q4 2017 results included a one time tax charge related to the newly enacted u s tax reform legislation regarding non gaap metrics adjusted ebitda was 59 million or 10 of revenue non gaap net income for the quarter was 35 million or 0 88 per diluted share compared with 40 million or 1 01 per share in 2017 a lower 2018 effective tax rate contributed 0 22 per share year over year eps increase free cash flow was 25 million in the fourth quarter lower than the prior year primarily due to the timing of working capital as well as restructuring and acquisition related outflows cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the fourth quarter was 122 million up 11 million from q3 turning to slide 9 total debt decreased slightly from q3 to just over 1 billion following further payments under revolving credit facility and the required principal payments on the term loan the balance sheet remains flexible with net leverage of 3 9 times and our operations continue to generate positive free cash flow now turning to the fourth quarter year over year revenue bridge on slide 10 total company revenue grew by 7 or 9 on a constant currency basis device solutions revenue was down 5 as reported and flat in constant currency networked solutions revenue grew 21 in constant currency driven by continued strength in north america and smart energy deployments outcomes revenue was down 6 in constant currency due to lower emea business and the completion of one time software deployment in the prior year the non gaap year over year eps bridge is on slide 11 q4 non gaap eps was 0 88 per diluted share compared with the 1 in the prior year net operational improvements contributed to 0 04 per share year over year increase after normalizing for higher special warranty expense which had a negative 0 22 per share impact year over year higher interest expense from debt used to finance the acquisition of silver spring networks decreased eps by 0 17 versus last year partially offsetting these expenses was a lower 2018 non gaap tax rate which benefitted eps by 0 22 year over year the lower rate was driven by one time favorable discrete tax items booked in q4 we do not expect these discrete tax benefits to continue in future quarters slide 12 through 14 show results by business segment for the fourth quarter device solutions revenue was 228 million and gross margin was 16 9 and operating of 11 1 the lower 2018 margin was driven by higher special warranty expense as well as higher component cost supply chain inefficiencies and product mix networked solutions revenue was 305 million on gross margin of 40 3 down slightly year over year due to lower open way shipments partially offset by higher mix of software operating margin was 31 1 down 160 basis points due to lower gross margin and higher product development expense as we invest in the technology roadmap following the silver spring networks acquisition outcomes revenue was 54 million on gross margin of 28 5 up 300 basis points year on year the increase was driven by improved scale and the continued integration of silver spring networks operating margin improved to 590 basis points to 12 3 on the higher gross margin combined with lower operating expenses now before we move on to 2019 guidance i d like to normalize our 2018 results to provide a more meaningful comparison to 2019 turning to slide 15 we have prepared a bridge that normalizes 2018 revenue and non gaap eps for current fx rates and onetime tax benefits booked in 2018 the fx rate normalization allows us to focus on the operational performance drivers versus year over year currency fluctuations in 2018 our revenue would have been approximately 40 million lower in today s exchange rates primarily due to the movement in the euro to usd dollar rates for 2019 we are forecasting a euro to us dollar rate of 1 14 versus the 1 18 realized in 2018 this 2019 forecasted rate is very close to 27 actual rates for comparison on this chart we also normalize 2018 non gaap eps for one time discrete tax items this normalization brings the 2018 effective tax rate to 30 versus the booked rate of 22 this tax normalization equates to 0 28 per share so after adjusting 2018 revenue and non gaap eps for the normalize tax rate and forecasted fx rates revenue reduces to 2 34 billion from 2 38 billion on an fx adjusted basis and non gaap eps on an fx and tax adjusted basis is 2 33 per share versus the actual of 2 65 this normalization is important to understand the operational performance embedded in our 2019 guidance now moving to the 2019 guidance on slide 16 we anticipate full year revenue to be in a range of 2 35 billion to 2 45 billion and non gaap eps between 2 35 to 2 75 per share the 2019 revenue guidance is a range of 1 to 5 growth on a constant currency basis or approximately 3 at the midpoint the revenue guidance assumes nearly double digit growth in the network solutions and outcomes segments partially offset by a high single digit reduction in the device solutions segment the decline in the device solutions segment is attributable to lower emea business following a very strong 2018 the non gaap eps guidance range represents 1 to 18 year on year improvement over normalized 2018 performance at the midpoint the non gaap eps guidance is 9 normalized year over year growth other guidance assumptions are the euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange rate of 1 14 that is just mentioned average non gaap effective tax rate of 31 total interest expense of approximately 15 million and average shares outstanding for the full year of 40 65 million turning to slide 17 we bridge from the normalized 2018 non gaap eps of 2 33 to the midpoint of our 2019 guidance of 2 55 and highlight the key driver year over year we expect net operational performance to increase year over year eps by 0 46 per share this category includes the flow through of the revenue increase i just discussed as well as additional year over year benefits from ongoing restructuring programs and acquisition synergies partially offsetting this is the addition of variable compensation versus the prior year we have also assumed an improving supply chain environment in the second half of the year to add some color to the gross margin profile over 2019 we expect gross margin in the first half of the year to be in line with our q4 2018 exit rate of approximately 30 looking to the second half of 2019 we anticipate gross margins will improve by 150 basis points to 200 basis points versus the first half from easing of the supply chain constraints and our operational initiatives all combined we expect net operational performance improvement of 0 46 per share over our normalized 2018 results moving on to other factors in our guidance we anticipate a significant increase in projected tariffs in 2019 over 2018 levels while we are working our supply chain strategy to reduce the tariff charges we currently anticipated approximately 0 15 per share of negative year on year eps impact we will continue to monitor this global situation other key assumptions are the tax rate of 31 in 2019 versus the normalized rate of 30 in 2018 and a year over year increase in share count combined these decreased eps by 0 09 per share year over year we expect that 2019 tax rate is slightly higher than 2018 due to jurisdictional mix of income we are encouraged by the strong revenue growth in our networked solutions and outcomes segments and throughout 2019 we will update you on our restructuring progress and margin improvement outlook before i turn the call back to philip i d also like to announce we will be holding an investor day on thursday june 27th at the nasdaq investor center in new york city we plan to provide updates on our strategy and market outlook details on our long term operating model as well as outlook for each of our realigned business segments updates on our technology roadmap and our restructuring efforts more information on the event will be posted in the coming weeks now i ll turn the call back to philip philip mezey thank you joan as joan discussed while our device solutions business is facing a softer european market we are very pleased with our bookings momentum in north america where we expect network solutions and the outcome business units will continue to grow at significant rates in 2019 this will be supported by our record backlog and strong pipeline of up sell and book and ship business in our guidance we do see a slight easing in supply chain lead times last quarter we ve reported over 550 parts with lead times over six months that has now decreased by approximately 14 while the decrease is promising we still have a ways to go and are not standing still on our gross margin improvement efforts we continue to introduce selective price increases and are aggressively targeting lower manufacturing costs and we ll continue to rotate our business to solutions with higher profit margins as joan mentioned we have an upcoming investor day where we will go deeper into our strategy and outlook for both the company and our new segments before we turn it over to q a i wanted to get some insight into our segment realignment strategy and our planned execution for 2019 starting with the device solutions business the meters and sensors that we manufacture are a critical part of our customers infrastructure safety and quality continue to be our top priority in delivering products to our customers with factory optimization and the impact of supply chain headwinds in 2018 we are focused on meeting our customers demand with improved quality and the prompt delivery of product in 2019 we will continue to expand the device solutions product portfolio with the introduction of new products across our regions including the release of a new intelistatic meter for our gas and water market a next generation prepayment solution for gas and a new electricity meter platform that will serve as the basis for all future development in iec electric markets globally moving to networked solutions we are excited about the continued growth in our networked solutions business in 2019 combined with our technology roadmap and planned investments we will reaffirm our strategy of being the industrial iot leader in energy and smart city space we look to expand product and partnerships allowing us to support an even greater selection of network devices for sensing metrology and control as the demand for smart infrastructure continues to grow our investment in riva6 the converge platform of openway riva and our gen5 networks will position our customers to manage and analyze the proliferation of devices and data for decades to come and finally our outcomes segment outcomes was created from three strong assets within the company itron s existing solutions the distributed energy management assets from the form of comverge acquisition and the former silver spring networks managed services and outcomes business we are focused on delivering value add services software and products that organize analyze and interpret data with a portfolio of turnkey solutions that range from endpoint management to data analytics we are excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for our outcomes business unit overtime we expect outcomes to be the fastest growing of all of our segments and are still working through efficiencies at scale we are balancing growth and margin improvement with our customers experience during the integration of the comverge and silver spring networks portfolios we are investing ahead of the growth curve and outcomes on future products with higher margin security and data analytics offerings this will increase the capabilities for our customers and improve our operating margins for our outcomes business by combining our segment strategy with near term execution on gross margin expansion and free cash flow we will deliver long term value for our customers and shareholders thank you operator please open the call to take some questions question and answer session operator we ll take the first question today from chip moore canaccord chip moore i appreciate the color you gave on guidance on margins in the first half versus the back half joan maybe is there a way to talk about margin progression with the new reporting structure how should we think about that they by segment joan hooper we re not going to provide specific segment guidance but i mean you can get a feel based on looking historical segments margins relative contribution but again the first half versus second half is more a function of the easing of the supply chain as well as some of the restructuring things that we re doing kicking in chip moore and just a follow up on margins the special warranty in the quarter what was going on there and anything lingering from that to think about into the current quarter tom deitrich this is tom i ll take that one what was behind that was an error that we had made in a product transfer as part of our manufacturing restructuring that was going on we moved a product from location x to location y and had some problems in the bring up the product that was affected there was time bound meaning it was manufactured during a certain period since then we ve understood the problem corrected it and made sure we learn from the mistake going forward so no overhang expected into 2019 operator the next question is noah kaye oppenheimer noah kaye maybe if we can just start with the top line your comments around devices being down high single digits and you pointed to emea is high single digit decline year over year your view of where the market is going to be joan hooper i ll start and then tom may want to answer i would say no the market the market build for devices is probably anywhere from zero to 3 growth but we had a very strong 2018 with our linky program in france and some of our other programs so it s more a function of projects that really ramped up in 2018 and they won t continue into 2019 tom deitrich no i think joan nailed it it is more a function of specific project transitions and country specific rollouts and timing i don t know that i would reference a full trend based on that there s no other way i would think about that noah the way we thought about that is in the past we talked about the migration from standard meters to smart meters this is a similar transition that s occurring over time it s now just expressing between what we re calling devices and networks noah kaye i guess just a related question for the avoidance of doubt i mean last quarter you talked about just not being able to fill some of that book and ship business because of the supply constraints is that embedded in your guidance or is that no longer an issue in your view for 19 tom deitrich what we do see is the supply chain environment starting to improve the fall is actually happening it take a little while to work through we think the supply chain environment will continue to improve during 2019 and that s reflected in the guidance so the revenue overhang i guess that we saw back in the back half of last year continues on although it s probably at a lower rate in this year but should improve throughout 2019 noah kaye and then i guess just turning to thinking about the profitability profile of the business you had a nice strong bookings number in network so backlog looks good exiting the year really where you re losing revenues is in that lower margin devices business and you re going to see you said close to double digit on the other side and i m not sure if i m doing my math right but just taking the midpoint of your guidance and working backwards from the assumptions i m coming out to around call it 250 type ebitda million number implied in the guidance which is healthy but about 40 bps margin expansion year over year and i guess just wanted to understand you called out tariffs are there any other considerations that we should really be thinking about as a headwind to profitability in 19 it seems like a little bit slower than we might look for joan hooper well again if you went to the slide 17 in the deck that i talk to the net operational improvement of 0 46 per share has a lot of puts and takes in it so it has higher revenue and again the higher revenue is really going to be coming from networked solutions and outcomes and obviously lowering devices have benefits of restructuring in there but there is some offsets in there so if you recall we zeroed out variable comp in 2018 and so we have restored some various comp in 2019 so that would all be netted out in there as well as well as just the real silver springs business in particular there is some general lumpiness when we have projects in software deployments to come in and out so that s all factored in weâ re looking at our backlog which is quite healthy as you indicated and we know the profile with that that there s quite a roll off in 2019 and that s been reflected in our guidance as well noah kaye and if i can just squeeze one more in just for my own comprehension i think the tariff and the incremental headwinds where are you really expecting that to come from is that list three china can you just give us a little bit of color because i think previously we ve seen it as more manageable so just wanted to understand how itâ s playing out for you this year philip mezey it is generally an east west not a north south phenomenon meaning china based or asia based goods tend to be more affected the types of commodities that are generally in focus there are metals so casting types of products as well as cables and connectors those are some of the types of things that are in play obviously the environment is pretty fluid ongoing global discussions probably even as we speak so it s tough to call but we wanted to make sure we were as transparent as we could be clearly our objective is to mitigate as much of that as possible by working within the rules but finding better ways that we can develop our supply chain to sidestep some of those things so that s our ongoing mission but i just pointed out to what we saw today operator next question will come from jeff osborne cowen and company jeff osborne couple questions on my end i m just curious on the philosophy or how you sat down and came up with the guidance is any approach in terms of your top line assumptions different in years past or more conservative more aggressive i m just curious as you look at backlog what the philosophy was and if there is any change versus prior years joan hooper no i would say it s a similar process obviously there is new segment so this time last year we would have been integrating silver springs when we had our old electric gas and watering so there are new segment so we have to go through the progress of re casting history which we shared last week but itâ s the same process we look at the backlog we look at the sales funnels we obviously talk with the business leaders and come up with what we think is a reasonable range jeff osborne and then joan i donâ t know if you can remind me but when you came up with the 2018 guidance with some of those non recurring tax benefits were those included and called out i forget from a year ago joan hooper no most of the tax benefits that occurred in 2018 most of them occurred in q4 so if you looked at our q4 2018 non gaap tax rate it s actually negative 2 so we had several large settlements of different countries multi year tax returns that settled as well as we had some statute limitations expirations that rolled off at the end of the year so it was really q4 phenomena jeff osborne and then is there any way that we can peel back the onion on slide 17 of the 0 46 in terms of what the benefit is on an absolute dollar basis with restructuring in 19 and 20 in particular 19 i guess as you have your 140 million program and then you called out variable comp and how people weren t paid last year but want to be paid this year what are those two numbers in particular would be helpful joan hooper i m not going to give you the variable comp that s a pretty sensitive number but we have talked about restructuring so i can give you that one so as phillip mentioned in his opening comments we ve laid out three restructuring programs the 2016 to 2018 in silver spring which totaled about 140 million we re a little over 70 million through 18 of that so think about it as roughly another 70 million to come split equally between 19 and 20 and as i look at 19 think about it equally between above the line and below the line so roughly 17 million 18 million gross margin and 17 million 18 million in opex and those are embedded in our guidance jeff osborne and then is it safe to say that the variable comp would be the next you said there are multiple puts and takes is restructuring the largest and variable comp the second largest if you want to break it out joan hooper no i mean the revenue fall through is quite large as well right so we have revenue growth embedded here as well so again there s lots of numbers but revenue fall through is the sizable number the variable comp add back you ve got mix you ve got all different things that go even merits that was happened late in 18 you get the run rate effect in the 19 so there s all things we have to factor in jeff osborne the last one i had was just on the supply chain constraints and can you talk about specifically what you re doing to mitigate that and give investors comfort for the second half of 19 as that improves are you putting cash deposits on future supply or developing or qualifying new suppliers anything you can give us just anecdote or specific would be helpful philip mezey sure i can take that one what we have been doing is a number of activities and you mentioned some of the bigger ones it is multi sourcing components to make sure that we can have the best diversity of supply as products roll in we ve been working hard on making sure we have forecast accuracy we have buffered inventory so bought more when it was available and you can see that in our balance sheet today to try to be prepared the part of our business thatâ s most exposed here is the book and ship business and making sure that we could do our best job to anticipate that and give us diversity of supply so multi sourcing its inventory buffering is building ahead on selected products that we had really the best medicine and that s what we are indeed seeing and finding a way to better manage situation we do see lead times starting to come down while phillip quoted the number the number of components that are still more than six months lead time are many hundreds but it s improved by about 15 quarter over quarter in terms of end using that as your measure of the health of the supply chain we do anticipate that it will take a couple more quarters for this to fully work its way through but do see steady improvement and better environment for the second half of the year based on the visibility we have today tom deitrich and then jeff maybe just a structural comment that says this is an identified plan many line items and owners that it is administered and reported on very very regularly there is quite a lot of structure around the achievement of these improvements jeff osborne and maybe just a follow up on that if you donâ t mind so is there a way to potentially maybe it wasnâ t an issue but some of your competitors have indicated that there was lost revenue in 18 did you lose any revenue in 18 or is there anything in the guidance as it relates to losing revenue in 19 as it relates to components issue philip mezey we did on a recent call actually bring revenue number down by 70 million and talked about the effect specifically on our purchase order business which is shorter cycle within the quarter business which is what led to providing that number of the 550 parts that are over six months to give a feeling for the challenge of capturing some of that business and through both inventory buffering and the initiatives that tom has talked about we feel that we ve accurately captured in the revenue and margin guidance or eps guidance that we ve captured the effects of the supply chain constraints in the numbers provided joan hooper and as tom indicated there are still are some hangover effect if you will on net revenue probably more so in the first half of the year than the second jeff osborne and i apologize for squeezing in one last one if you donâ t mind but joan the tax benefit that you had in the fourth quarter that was unforeseen as it relates to the original guidance so if some of those jurisdictions hadnâ t showed up obviously the numbers would have been worst but i m just trying to get a sense of did you have that in the plan but you just weren t sure if they would come in how do we think about the 0 30 headwind that you flagged in slide 17 of the 0 28 i m just trying to reconcile all the moving pieces on tax and what you do when andâ joan hooper if you go back to our last call we guided to an eps range and that had probably about 5 million or 6 million of a discrete tax benefit embedded in the range so that was basically about half of what we got so the rest of it was settlements that came in that we weren t expecting to come in or statute limitation exploration so you might have a lots of different jurisdictions where the statute expires in 12 31 you really don t know whether or not you are going to have an issue with that particular jurisdiction until it expires and so we don t typically bake that in the forecast but i would say about half of it was baked in the eps guidance that we provided you operator from jmp securities joe osha has the next question joe osha a couple of things first back to this issue of the warranty charges in q4 the fact that those arenâ t going to recur joan per your comments when combined with the margin guidance suggest that there might maybe some other headwinds in the first part of the year given the fact that the gross margin is flattish or am i missing something joan hooper no itâ s primarily going to be the timing of software related deployment so if you have a lot of software in q4 that doesn t reoccur in q1 you re going to have a natural dip in gross margin from that the special warranty not recurring in q1 will go the opposite way so it s puts and takes with a lot of different opposite way so it s puts and takes a lot of different things but i would say software is the biggest one that goes the other way joe osha and the idea of being then that those don t recur in the second half joan hooper well again a software deployment is very project based so with particular customers they don t necessarily go every single quarter so in the fourth quarter we did have some large projects that concluded that allowed us to recognize the software revenue and that tends to be very high margin business joe osha second one then would be as you think about the second half of the year thank you for the detail on how those cost savings break down but to return to an earlier question is there any organic improvement in gross margins that occurs as the revenue rises or should we basically think about gross margin as being static with the exception of these benefits flowing through from the cost reduction efforts joan hooper well again there s mix in there as well so to the extent our networks solutions and outcomes business are growing those are higher margin businesses than the device business which are shrinking so you are going to have the benefit of that mix as well joe osha so there is some organic improvement there and then the last question would be i think we can see how ebitda is trending i m wondering what your thoughts are about the business s ability to generate free cash flow in 2019 joan hooper i think the free cash flow continues to be very healthy for the year this year we generated about 50 million of free cash flow i would expect this to close to double that next year joe osha and is that just operational improvement or is that working capital management or what s driving thatâ joan hooper it will a combination of both operator the next question will come from pavel molchanov raymond james pavel molchanov inq3 and q4 as i recall on in talking about component shortages the main culprit was mlccs and many of the component suppliers and consumers have commented in the last two three months that the situation with mlccs has largely normalized is that consistent with what you re seeing and if so which other components continue to be a headwind right now tom deitrich mlccs are starting to normalize from our point of view i don t want to go too technical but depends on the case size some of the smaller sizes are in a little bit better shape than some of the legacy technology some of the older versions so mlcc is getting better but i would say not quite solved yet other passives and discreet so mosfets being another one that tends to be troubling so thatâ s in mlcc chip resistors so you get some hotspots in each one of those depending on age of technology and specific type pavel molchanov follow up a broader question we just had the biggest electric utility in the western united states go bankrupt has that had any impact positive or negative on ami modernization the willingness of utilities to invest in modernizing the grid perhaps from the standpoint of trying to avoid the infrastructure issues that pg e obviously ran into tom deitrich so i would say yes it has a beneficial i mean it s a sad way to say the beneficial impact the regulatory conferences and many utility conferences that i attend the discussion is about reliability and resiliency it s not just wildfires in california that has to do with polar bombs and super storm sandy and the hurricane sitting in the southern united states but there is a broadening awareness that volatile climatic events are going to require investments and hardening electric gas and water infrastructure and therefore we feel that that is a sign that additional grid infrastructure is going to be made in the coming years operator our next question will come from david katter baird david katter i wanted to ask a quick one on the backlog it seems like sequentially you booked some longer tail business so i was wondering if you could talk some of the dynamics that play there and whether that s a trend you re seeing with the longer total backlog going up and the 12 months going down ken gianella the ratio was in our backlog itâ s just a slight change i mean we came with the record total backlog at 3 17 and the 12 months came out about 1 35 in change so it s flat on that perspective as we said on the call the mix associated with that two thirds of that heavily weighted towards the network business and when you do that you normally see a three to four year roll off of backlog so for the additions we have and the amount that i see in one year that ratio pretty much fit to the models that we see for the profile we have in backlog there david katter and then one more quick one i know you touched on this but on the restructuring with the 70 million over the next two years i was just wondering at a high level if you could talk about how some of the supply chain headwinds have impacted the cadence of the restructuring which was focused on the supply chain has that delayed progress or how have you managed to navigate both the headwinds and the need to optimize the supply chain tom deitrich i would say i donâ t know that it has materially changed it it certainly has put some extra stress on the team and probably it s used some outside resources here and there to best cope with the situation but i would say i donâ t know that it has materially changed the timing of what you see in motion certainly it created the financial impact that you saw but i don t know that i would talk too much that it has affected the timing of programs that are in flight joan hooper that said had we not been in the midst of restructuring i think the supply chain hit is what has hurt us a lot more than they did so the ability to leverage the purchasing power of contract manufacturers was very useful operator and everyone at this time there are no further questions i will hand the conference back to philip mezey for any additional or closing remarks philip mezey thank you everyone so again tremendous amount of progress that was made in 2018 from a strategic point of view in terms of not only our restructuring plans but obviously the acquisition and integration of silver spring which has gone extremely well the integration of all of our financial systems and back offices lot of heavy lifting that s gone on in 2018 some of which is obscured as you know by the supply chain headwinds that we face and with that significant progress we feel very strongly that the momentum that we re entering 19 is quite strong and however based upon the misses that we had in 2018 we are appropriately projecting some continued first half margin pressure and think that as absolutely the prudent thing for us to do but the opportunity for us to continue to drive margins in the second half is there and in place and projects are identified so thank you all for your interest and look forward to talking to you all soon operator ladies and gentlemen there will be an audio replay of today s conference available this afternoon you can access the audio replay by dialing 1 888 203 1112 or 1 719 457 0820 with the past

you know that trade breakthrough we were all talking about a few days ago it s not looking so close just three days after president donald trump reported substantial progress in talks with china the man doing most of the talking was out pouring cold water much still needs to be done us trade negotiator robert lighthizer told congress and it s still in doubt whether the two sides can come to terms the us china trade deal may be further away than we think credit bloomberg lighthizer s refusal to bend in pursuit of a deal is admirable in its way as we argued earlier this week the us companies that have suffered weaker demand and higher costs from the past year s trade war are unlikely to welcome a final agreement based on no more than commitments to buy more farm produce and hydrocarbons at the same time perhaps he has something to learn from the trump administration s approach to north korea negotiators from washington are no longer demanding pyongyang make a full accounting of its nuclear programs nbc news reported thursday citing current and former senior us officials that flexibility looks alarming in a nuclear proliferation context on trade however a big stupid trumpian deal may be just what the world needs
