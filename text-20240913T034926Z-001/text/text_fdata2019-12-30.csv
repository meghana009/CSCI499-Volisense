we have decided to release the latest data on worldwide remittance flows via this blog for the latest data on global migration and a well rounded discussion of issues relating to migration remittances and development please refer to the recent world bank report the first part of the blog covers remittance flows which is sdg indicator 17 3 2 the second part reports on remittance costs which is sdg indicator 10 c 1 no significant data updates were available on recruitment costs sdg indicator 10 7 1 thanks to kebba jammeh immaculate nafula machasio and maja vezmar for research assistance and rebecca ong for communications support remittance flows worldwide remittance flows to low and middle income countries lmics are expected to reach 551 billion in 2019 up by 4 7 percent compared to 2018 table 1 remittances have exceeded official aid by a factor of three since the mid 1990s this year they are on track to overtake foreign direct investment fdi flows to lmics figure 1 figure 1 remittances on track to overtake fdi flows sources world bank knomad staff estimates world development indicators and international monetary fund imf balance of payments statistics note fdi foreign direct investment oda official development assistance in 2019 in current u s dollar terms the top five remittance recipient countries are projected to be india china mexico the philippines and egypt figure 2 as a share of gross domestic product gdp for 2019 the top five recipients would be smaller economies tonga haiti nepal tajikistan and the kyrgyz republic figure 2 top recipients of remittances 2019 growth of remittance flows slowed to 4 7 percent in 2019 compared to a robust 8 6 percent in 2018 cyclical factors affecting the growth of remittance flows include a economic growth in source countries b the price ofoil and c variations in exchange rates for example a strong economy and employment situation in the united states implies buoyant remittance flows to latin america and the caribbean conversely weak oil prices imply lower growth in outward remittances from the russian federation to central asian and eastern european countries figure 3 table 1 estimates and projections of remittance flows to low and middle income regions source world bank knomad see appendix a in world bank 2017 for data and forecast methods notes e estimate f forecast projections for 2019 2020 and 2021 are based on a low case scenario that assumes unit elasticity of remittances to gdp growth in remittance source countries figure 3 oil prices impact outward remittances from russia sources world bank knomad staff estimates world development indicators and international monetary fund imf balance of payments statistics note four quarter moving averages when the currency of a source country depreciates against the us dollar the value of outward remittances in us dollar terms declines approximately a half of remittance flows to lmics is estimated to originate in countries where us dollar is the main currency or the local currency is closely linked to the us dollar e g the gulf cooperation council gcc countries the rest are denominated in other currencies and therefore subject to currency valuation effects for example 12 percent of such remittances originated in euro zone economies 4 percent in the united kingdom 3 percent in the russian federation 3 percent in canada and 2 percent in australia figure 4 figure 4 sources of remittance flows to lmics by currency sources world bank knomad staff estimates note aud australian dollar cad canadian dollar gbp british pound usd us dollar remittances outflows from some major sending countries other than the us have been impacted due to the depreciation of their currencies against the us dollar for example the euro depreciated by 8 percent and the ruble by 16 percent against the us dollar as of the first quarter of 2019 as a result even as outward remittances in germany and russia increased in local currency terms they declined in us dollar terms table 2 table 2 decline in remittance outflows in dollar terms due to depreciation of sending currencies notes calculations for 2019 q1 compared to a year ago data on outward remittance flows are available until 2019 q1 sources world bank knomad staff estimates based on data from imf balance of payments statistics and international financial statistics databases regional remittance flows the slowdown in the growth of remittances in 2019 was sharp in all regions except lac and ssa figure 5 in 2019 latin america and the caribbean would see the fastest pace of remittance growth at 7 8 percent due to the continued robustness of the us economy remittances would increase moderately in south asia 5 3 percent sub saharan africa 5 1 percent and east asia and pacific 3 8 percent due to the buoyancy in inflows from the us being offset by slower growth of receipts from the euro area and the gcc the growth rate of remittances is likely to remain weak in middle east and north africa 3 percent due to structural changes such as labor market nationalization and introduction of value added tax in the gcc countries and in europe and central asia 1 8 percent because of lower oil prices and ruble depreciation on outflows from russia figure 5 growth of remittances by region sources world bank knomad staff estimates remittance flows are projected to reach 597 billion in 2021 assuming that outward remittances growth in tandem with the nominal gdp in us dollar terms of the source countries these flows are projected to reach 574 billion in 2020 and 597 billion by 2021 this forecast methodology is conservative as it does not account for increasing migration flows falling remittance costs and progress in technology of remittance services for a description of the methodology used to forecast remittance flows see world bank 2017 however there are downside risks to this outlook in the next two years foremost among the risks is anti immigration sentiment in almost all large host countries for migrants including the united states europe russia and south africa even in the gcc countries where the economies are critically dependent on migrant workers the policy stance is to discourage recruitment of foreign workers in order to stimulate employment of nationals and impose taxes or other restrictions on outward remittances in the medium term the growth of remittances would continue to be restrained by high costs of remittances and stringent financial regulations which are discussed next in the long term say ten years in the future the risks are on the upside mostly due to the fact that global migration flows are expected to increase significantly see 2019 world bank report the average income gap between high income countries and low income countries a fundamental driver of migration presently stands at 54 1 over 43 000 vs under 800 which would encourage more migration from lmics demographic change is a second fundamental driver of migration by 2030 the working age population of the lmics is expected to increase by over 550 million it is likely that a significant part of this population would not find jobs or well paying jobs in the country of birth thus increasing migration pressures a third fundamental driver is climate change which could displace as many as 143 million persons according to the world bank s 2018 groundswell report additionally migration and refugee movement may also increase due to fragility conflict and violence remittance costs remain well above the sdg target according to the world bank s remittance prices worldwide database the average cost of sending 200 to lmics was 6 8 percent in the second quarter of 2019 only slightly below previous quarters figure 6 this is more than double the sustainable development goal sdg target of 3 percent by 2030 sdg target 10 c the cost was the lowest in south asia at around 5 percent while sub saharan africa continued to have the highest average cost at about 9 percent figure 6 remittance costs across many african corridors and small islands in the pacific remain above 10 percent note that intra regional migration in africa is over two thirds of all international migration from africa past studies have pointed out very high costs for sending money within africa leveraging migration for africa world bank 2011 although no recent data are available presently on such south south remittance costs figure 6 how much does it cost to send 200 source remittance prices worldwide database world bank note eap east asia and pacific eca europe and central asia lac latin america and the caribbean mena middle east and north africa sar south asia ssa sub saharan africa banks are the costliest channel for sending remittances with an average cost of 10 3 percent in 2019 q2 while post offices are lowest at 5 7 percent also in an apparent example of policy incoherence remittance costs tend to include a premium a cost mark up when national post offices have exclusive partnership arrangements with a dominant money transfer operator mto such premia average 2 3 percent of the cost of transferring remittances worldwide and are as high as 4 6 percent in the case of india the largest recipient of remittances figure 7 opening up national post offices national banks and telecommunications companies to partnerships with other mtos could remove entry barriers and increase competition in remittance markets figure 7 average costs of remittances by type of provider 2019 q2 source calculations by world bank knomad staff for 2018 q4 based on the remittance prices worldwide database world bank note mto money transfer operator regulations relating to anti money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism aml cft tend to be onerous in the case of cash remittances which are used by unbanked migrant workers and their families back home compliance with such regulations is easier in the case of remittances originating from bank accounts there has been a rapid increase in mobile phone and internet based technology solutions for providing remittance services and more recently in block chain based applications however such fintech solutions almost exclusively rely on banks to provide the know your client compliance requirements thus limiting themselves to banked customers and leaving out a vast majority of unbanked customers who may be encouraged to use informal remittance channels
as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash

reviewing the shifting global dynamics as we begin a new year today asia is home to three of the world s top four economic powers china india and japan the region s combined gdp exceeds that of the united states and european union photo romeo gacad afp the world turned a corner in 2019 the problem is that the world order didn t turn with it this disconnect could have disastrous consequences the biggest global change has been the start of the asian century today asia is home to three of the world s top four economic powers in purchasing power parity terms china india and japan the region s combined gdp exceeds that of the united states and of the european union the us is no longer even the most globalised power that title now goes to china already a larger trading partner to more countries than the us china is signing more free trade agreements as well including potentially the largest in history the regional comprehensive economic partnership the us by contrast has abandoned or is abandoning ftas such as the trans pacific partnership which japanese prime minister shinzo abe has kept alive without the us with a new name comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the us share of global trade continues to shrink the world order has not kept pace with these shifting economic dynamics on the contrary the us dollar remains the predominant currency for settling international trade the us and the eu retain control of the two leading global economic organisations the international monetary fund and the world bank and the united nations security council the only body that can issue binding decisions for the un s 193 member states is dominated by just a few largely declining powers in theory the easiest of these incongruities to address should be the inadequate influence of emerging powers such as china in the imf and the world bank after all the us and europe have already acknowledged including in the 2006 and 2007 g20 communiqués that the selection of senior management of the imf and world bank should be based on merit ensuring broad representation of all member countries yet the anachronistic gentlemen s agreement that has kept an american at the head of the world bank and a european leading the imf has proved stubbornly resilient in 2007 dominique strauss kahn became imf managing director succeeded by another french citizen christine lagarde in 2011 six years later lagarde declared that the imf could be based in beijing by 2027 if growth trends continue and are reflected in the imf s voting structure after all she noted the imf s bylaws call for the institution s head office to be located in the largest member economy yet when lagarde resigned from her post this year to become president of the european central bank it was another european who took her place bulgarian economist kristalina georgieva likewise the world bank presidency passed from robert zoellick to jim yong kim in 2012 and then to david malpass this year future historians will marvel at the imprudence of the old powers shameless refusal to share control of global institutions and yet the imf and the world bank are not the only institutions that need reform the un security council too needs to be reformed if the security council s composition is not updated the body could lose its credibility and moral authority to avert such an outcome perhaps the security council could adopt a 7 7 7 formula the first seven countries economies would be permanent members each representing a different region the second seven would be semi permanent members a rotating selection of 28 countries based on population and gnp the remaining 160 countries would rotate into the remaining seven seats the most difficult incongruity to resolve will be that between the us declining leadership and its currency s role as the leading international reserve currency today more than 40 percent of cross border payments and 90 percent of foreign exchange trading is settled in us dollars this reflects decades of trust the us had deep markets strong institutions including efficient courts and an independent central bank and it did not use the dollar as a tool to advance its own interests but since 2017 the us administration has been aggressively undermining the international community s trust in the dollar the white house has pressured the us federal reserve to lower interest rates in order to deliver short term economic growth in fact the white house has weaponised the dollar labelling china a currency manipulator and

adversaries russia leads a new de dollarisation trend but also of key allies jean claude juncker the former european commission president has pledged that the euro would become an active instrument of eu sovereignty it is also telling that france germany and the united kingdom in collaboration with china and russia have created the instrument in support of trade exchanges to bypass us sanctions on

by kishore mahbubani china daily updated 2019 12 30 07 11 the world turned a corner in 2019 the problem is that the world order didn t turn with it this disconnect could have disastrous consequences the biggest global change has been the start of the asian century today asia is home to three of the world s top four economic powers in purchasing power parity terms china india and japan the region s combined gdp exceeds that of the united states and of the european union the us is no longer even the most globalized power that title now goes to china already a larger trading partner to more countries than the us china is signing more free trade agreements as well including potentially the largest in history the regional comprehensive economic partnership the us by contrast has abandoned or is abandoning ftas such as the trans pacific partnership which japanese prime minister shinzo abe has kept alive without the us with a new name comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the us share of global trade continues to shrink the world order has not kept pace with these shifting economic dynamics on the contrary the us dollar remains the predominant currency for settling international trade the us and the eu retain control of the two leading global economic organizations the international monetary fund and the world bank and the united nations security council the only body that can issue binding decisions for the un s 193 member states is dominated by just a few largely declining powers in theory the easiest of these incongruities to address should be the inadequate influence of emerging powers such as china in the imf and the world bank after all the us and europe have already acknowledged including in the 2006 and 2007 g20 communiqués that the selection of senior management of the imf and world bank should be based on merit ensuring broad representation of all member countries yet the anachronistic gentlemen s agreement that has kept an american at the head of the world bank and a european leading the imf has proved stubbornly resilient in 2007 dominique strauss kahn became imf managing director succeeded by another french citizen christine lagarde in 2011 six years later lagarde declared that the imf could be based in beijing by 2027 if growth trends continue and are reflected in the imf s voting structure after all she noted the imf s bylaws call for the institution s head office to be located in the largest member economy yet when lagarde resigned from her post this year to become president of the european central bank it was another european who took her place bulgarian economist kristalina georgieva likewise the world bank presidency passed from robert zoellick to jim yong kim in 2012 and then to david malpass this year future historians will marvel at the imprudence of the old powers shameless refusal to share control of global institutions and yet the imf and the world bank are not the only institutions that need reform the un security council too needs to be reformed if the security council s composition is not updated the body could lose its credibility and moral authority to avert such an outcome perhaps the security council could adopt a 7 7 7 formula the first seven countries economies would be permanent members each representing a different region the second seven would be semi permanent members a rotating selection of 28 countries based on population and gnp the remaining 160 countries would rotate into the remaining seven seats the most difficult incongruity to resolve will be that between the us declining leadership and its currency s role as the leading international reserve currency today more than 40 percent of cross border payments and 90 percent of foreign exchange trading is settled in us dollars this reflects decades of trust the us had deep markets strong institutions including efficient courts and an independent central bank and it did not use the dollar as a tool to advance its own interests but since 2017 the us administration has been aggressively undermining the international community s trust in the dollar the white house has pressured the us federal reserve to lower interest rates in order to deliver short term economic growth in fact the white house has weaponized the dollar labeling china a currency manipulator and instructing the us treasury to put more countries including close asian and european allies under surveillance the us administration s actions have raised the hackles not only of traditional adversaries russia leads a new de dollarization trend but also of key allies jean claude juncker the former european commission president has pledged that the euro would become an active instrument of eu sovereignty it is also telling that france germany and the united kingdom in collaboration with china and russia have created the instrument in support of trade exchanges to bypass us sanctions on iran but in a sense the us administration has done the world a favor by making undeniable what was already obvious if world leaders do not start addressing the contradictions plaguing the world order soon the likely result is crisis and even more dangerous contradictions the writer a professor in the practice of public policy at the national university of singapore is the author of has the west

african business looks forward to 2020 with analysis of political and economic trends and predictions of what lies ahead from the region s top economists 2019 has been a year of cataclysmic political and economic change on the continent revolutions con vulsed algeria and sudan deposing long time strongmen omar al bashir and abdelaziz bouteflika in april public anger and discontent stretched to the southernmost reaches of the continent in september as mobs looted foreign owned stores in south africa while other citizens took to the streets to protest a spate of violent attacks against women it was hardly ideal timing for embattled president cyril ramaphosa who was forced to avert his gaze from the expensively hosted world economic forum meanwhile as regional policy makers scrambled to make sense of the continental free trade deal which got its final ratification from gambia in june nigeria raised the drawbridge halting the free movement of goods in an anti smuggling crackdown that sent shockwaves through west africa south africa s story in south africa a year of hope has turned into a frustrating continuation of economic and institutional inertia as ramaphosa struggles to turn promises into reform growth continues to stall while unemployment languishes but the new year will see more storm clouds gathering as the country faces the real prospect of a credit downgrade if the government s new budget released in february fails to deliver a viable turnaround plan that promises big results to international investors if south africa s debt falls into sub investment grade it could spark a sell off by institutional investors across the the globe including pension funds hedge funds and banks says chris va ndome a research associate at chatham house s africa program that could result in 15 billion leaving south africa effectively says vandome citing figures released by bank of new york mellon this enormous financial fallout would raise borrowing costs at a time when the country desperately needs loans and portfolio investment to balance its deficit with south africa s growth projections lowered from 1 2 to 0 7 by the international monetary fund imf this year and popular discontent brewing there is little room for error one thing that could boost south africa is the easing of trade tensions following a mooted deal agreed in december by washington and beijing a pick up of global trade after a poor year could provide a lift for commodities such as south african palladium which provides 40 of the global market says charlie robertson the global chief economist at russian investment bank renaissance capital we re seeing palladium prices reach record highs in south africa at least in the past few years with platinum and palladium making up 10 of their exports but only meaningful political change will truly help south africa to achieve much needed growth the crises at state owned power utility eskom and south african airways which was placed in receivership offer a final chance for the government to impose competent leadership and remove the stain of underperformance and corruption ramaphosa has had to tread carefully in a faction ridden anc but he no longer has the luxury of time elsewhere southern africa s second largest economy angola is expected to struggle in 2020 shrinking 1 9 compared to a 3 6 contraction in 2019 according to the economist intelligence unit continuing oil reforms following the end of the dos santos era could bode well for the future however turning its back on the world meanwhile in west africa nigeria s re elected p resident buhari has unwisely escalated anti trade policies and import restrictions the government moves which benefits only a few industrialists are shaping th e economic climate of africa s biggest economy with dramatic spill over effects on neighbouring countries like benin and togo warns john ashbourne capital economics africa economist in august buhari ordered the central bank to stop providing foreign currency to food importers to spur domestic agricultural production by october he closed the country s porous borders to all imported goods without warning in an apparent bid to curb rampant smuggling and boost rice production that s one big political event that really has changed the fortunes of that whole part of the continent if not the continent as a whole ashbourne says nigeria s central bank governor godwin emefiele told a bankers dinner in lagos in november that he intended to advise the government to maintain border closures to boost economic output in the non oil sector such efforts to industrialise the economy through latin american style import substitution is a policy that precedes buhari and is expected to continue next year and beyond his tenure which ends in 2023 says robertson i don t think buhari will change his views on this and if nigeria carries on with this latin american approach it is likely to produce less growth then if they chose an open more export orientated model elsewhere in west africa uncertainty over cote d ivoire s october elections is spooking investors as an unpredictable outcome looms over president alassane ouatta ra s pledge to run for a third term investors will be more relaxed about francophone africa s other key market senegal where the reelection of macky sall in february promised continuity for international oil companies and sound oversight of the multi billion hydrocarbons sector which expects to see first production in 2022 cfa countries will continue the trend of investment led growth good stories and responsible policy making from the presidents in the year ahead robertson says yet they will be operating under a different monetary system the cfa franc will be renamed the eco but will remain pegged to the euro in eight west african countries from july 2020 african countries in the bloc will no longer have to keep 50 of their reserves in the french treasury as financial ties to former colonial master paris weaken stars of the east meanwhile in east africa a transport race is unfolding tanzania and rwa nda are making an aggressive push to depose kenya as the regional transit hub tanzanian president john magufuli is building a 2 5bn bullet train with the help of rwanda in a bid to capture east africa s inland trade and drive it through the port of dar es salaam the project expected to be completed in 2022 will run from the western tanzanian town of isaka to the rwandan capital kigali in direct competition with a rival route in mombasa just 500km up the coast tanzania s railway is the raison d être of kenya s railway says aly khan satchu the ceo of nairobi based investment advisory firm rich management compromising kenya s regional transit routes further is oil rich qatar who are fronting the funds for rwanda to build a gleaming international airport in kigali in return for a 60 stake in the project and a foothold in east africa s aspiring service hub you can imagine the qataris will build something really serious that will represent big competition for kenya whose airline lies in tatters satchu says kenyan airways posted record losses in 2019 as it flounders with pilot shortages and an industrial dispute kagame is more nimble he s quicker and he makes optimal economic decisions much faster and that s his big advantage i think kenya is paying the price for that in the year to come ethiopia and tanzania will continue to grow at 7 2 and 4 5 respectively the imf predicts their sophisticated economies will be tempered only by liquidity constraints and political contestation with impending elections in both countries ethiopia s election is scheduled to take place by may while magafuli whose protectionist policies have spooked investors and partners plans to run for re election in april abiy s prospects for re election are bright the energetic reform minded leader has succeeded in sketching out a positive vision for africa s future which resonates with youth forget ramaphosa and mnangagwa they re yesterday s dinosaurs is the guy who is able to connect with people of the new generation which is 99 5 of africa satchu says that was confirmed with abiy s stunning nobel peace prize win for his successful efforts in resolving a decades long conflict with eritrea yet ongoing political and ethnic tensions tied to his dramatic reforms could test abiy and the country to the limit in 2020 the imf is poised to approve landmark 3bn loan which could offset a liquidity crunch in the cash strapped nation and give it a great deal of momentum as abiy seeks to keep ethnic nationalist forces at bay and win the election business reforms including privatisations remain on the cards if the prime minister can hold it together ethiopia will be a star performer over the next two to three years says satchu in kenya president uhuru kenyatta has overseen growth estimated at 5 6 and will hope to continue growing the economy the imf has praised the country s progress but warned in november of an outsized budget deficit and the need for further tax and expenditure reforms to help the country continue on its path making it north africa s industrial revolution in north africa morocco s manufacturing sector is barrelling ahead as it continues to attract foreign direct investment the sector contributes more than 20 to the country s gdp and employs 11 of the labour force it s leading the second industrialisation wave in africa says robertson the question for me is do we see tunisia and egypt follow that with tunisia s elections out of the way and egypt s prospects buoyed by a stable and strong currency which has seen inflation drop to 3 6 international investors may be tempted to build new factories in the country this could harness egypt s 100m people into a manufacturing power house that feeds into europe robertson says that s something i m certainly going to be watching in 2020 down about debt africa s three largest economies which account for almost 40 of the continent s gdp will continue to disappoint next year causing sub saharan africa s growth to reach 3 2 in 2019 and 3 6 in 2020 according to the imf while growth in africa s fastest growing economy ghana is expected to fall from 7 5 in 2019 to 5 6 in 2020 in anticipation of erratic spending during the election cycle ethiopia and cote d ivoire tell a much different growth story from the region s largest economies says john ashbourne from capital economics a major trend that will carry over next year is how african countries will manage their debt moving forward the imf warns that while the continent s debt load is stabilising indebted countries could face headwinds as slowing global growth weighs on exports seven african countries including mozambique south sudan and zimbabwe are in debt distress according to the imf nine others including ethiopia ghana and cameroon are at high risk of debt creeping up to distressing levels in kenya the penny has dropped now that the debt is in amber territory says satchu the africa continent as a whole has got to get a bit more realistic about how they are going to manage their debt moving forward we re going to see some crises developing in the next 12 months as government looks beyond 2020 they are also waking up to the reality of the long road ahead in implementing the african free trade agreement says john ashbourne it s a very long process and its not going to kick off any time soon the future of african investment the key hubs for investment in 2020 are expected to be morocco egypt ghana cote d ivoire namibia botswana rwanda ethiopia and kenya predicts rob hersov the ceo of investment platform invest africa not south africa until president ramaphosa starts to send the zuma gupta molefe mob to jail and shows he can fix eskom and the soe s he adds with the continent s two largest economies south africa and nigeria growing on average about 1 2 for the past five years they re just not producing the figures that will excite global investors says charlie robertson will we see investor appetite in africa pickup in 2020 not when south africa is on the verge of recession and not when nigeria s growth is as sluggish as 2 3 says robertson in both cases gdp has been growing below population growth now for the last four years so people are getting poorer that s not the mark of an exciting continent that people want to pour money into
global finance capital has seized control of the economies of most nation states the citizens watch helplessly as money and goods are transferred with little regulation across borders they watch as jobs in manufacturing and the professions are shipped to regions of the global south where most workers are paid a dollar or less an hour and receive no benefits they watch as the taxes of the rich and corporations are slashed often to zero they watch as austerity programs dismantle or privatize utilities and basic social services jacking up fees to consumers they watch as chronic unemployment and underemployment devastate workers especially the young they watch as wages stagnate or decline leaving working men and women with unsustainable debts this economic tyranny lies at the root of the unrest in hong kong india chile france iran iraq and lebanon as well as the rise of right wing demagogues and false prophets such as british prime minister boris johnson president donald trump and indian prime minister narendra modi it does not matter whether liberals or conservatives tories or labour republicans or democrats are in power finance capital is impervious to political control the newly defeated labour party in britain by adopting a brexit neutral stance in the election badly misread the zeitgeist yes its leader jeremy corbyn had to contend with hysterical warnings of economic collapse and endured a smear campaign amplified by a media mouthing the accusations of his tory opponents that included claims he was a threat to national security and an anti semite but his and labour s failure to appreciate how desperate workers were for a solution even one growing out of magical thinking about the promise of brexit was a mistake brexit is not a realistic alternative to economic tyranny but it at least offers a hope however unfounded of shattering the bonds of corporate power it posits itself as a weapon in the war between the insiders and the outsiders that this desperate hope by the outsiders is peddled by con artists and charlatans such as johnson and trump is part of the sickness of our age an echo of the economic distortions and right wing populism that saw fascists rise to power in italy and germany in the first part of the 20th century goldman sachs jpmorgan chase citibank exxon mobile walmart apple and amazon are the modern versions of the east india company or la compagnie française de l orient et de la chine these and others among today s global corporations with the assistance of the world bank the world trade organization and the international monetary fund have created unassailable monopolies and effectively hollowed out many nation states both physically and culturally forlorn derelict urban wastelands populated by the bitterly dispossessed are as common in france or britain as they are in america s rust belt governments captive to corporate control have been prostituted to transfer wealth upward swell corporate profits and crush dissent at the expense of democracy the decay and rupture of the social bonds that once held our societies together have unleashed the dark pathologies of opioid alcohol and gambling addictions and led to an explosion of hate crimes and mass shootings along with suicide social control provided by work civic and political participation bonds that integrated us into our communities and gave us a sense of place dignity and agency has been handed over to a heavily militarized police a massive prison system and a judicial system complicit in abolishing basic rights including due process and privacy so to steal a line from vladimir lenin what is to be done can a reformist political candidate a bernie sanders or perhaps an elizabeth warren although i question the authenticity of warren defeat trump and the retrograde forces that empower him or will the u s reformers suffer corbyn s fate in short can the system be reformed from the inside or will we have to take to the streets as the people are doing in chile lebanon france hong kong and elsewhere to demand the overthrow of corporate rule the left even under corbyn is not ready to speak in revolutionary language revolutionary rhetoric within the political system has been adopted by the neofascists and the hard right the brexit debate is about blowing up the system not working within it those who support brexit and johnson will like those who support trump be betrayed but the language employed by johnson and trump is about destruction and this yearning for destruction runs deep among the working class the tragedy is that by backing these demagogues the public is complicit in its own enslavement extinction rebellion which i support is attempting to counter this corporate assault and the consequent ecocide with revolutionary language and sustained civil disobedience designed to make governance impossible i hope extinction rebellion will gain enough popular support to raise a strong barrier before the corporate state starts employing the brute force outlined in operation yellowhammer the six page british government plan that calls for the possible deployment of 50 000 regular and reserved troops and 10 000 riot police to cope with the unrest that might be caused by food and medical shortages following britain s departure from the european union the violent suppression of protesters in france chile iraq iran lebanon india and hong kong is already underway a window into what may be coming to england the united states and other countries that attempt to throw off the yoke of corporate oppression the corporate state loathes the political left but the american political left by agreeing to operate within the constrained and largely rigged electoral system is easily neutered as liberalism was this year in britain and was in 2016 and will be in 2020 in the united states america s democratic party leadership as hostile to its progressive candidates as many in the labour party hierarchy in britain were to corbyn employed a series of measures to prevent sanders from obtaining the nomination in 2016 they included a superdelegates scheme the use of hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate money iron control of the democratic national committee and blocking those registered as independents from voting in democratic primaries politicians such as sanders and corbyn are easily dispatched but while the corporate state detests political mavericks such as sanders and corbyn it both hates and fears the revolutionary left the revolutionary left speaks an unvarnished truth about corporate power and calls out the entire political ruling class for its complicity it is not interested in accommodation it seeks to disrupt and paralyze the corporate state when many thousands as in hong kong take to the streets shouting slogans like there are no rioters only a tyrannical regime and it was you who taught me that peaceful marches are useless the corporate ruling elites begin to worry this is why populist leaders including eric drouet of the gilets jaunes or yellow vests in france are arrested it is why roger hallam the co founder of extinction rebellion spent six weeks in jail this fall in britain it is why edward leung is serving a six year prison sentence on charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer during the 2016 fishball revolution in hong kong revolutionaries refuse to play by the rules these global revolutionary movements embody a resurrection of the concept of the common good the belief that a society should be structured around caring for all its members especially the most vulnerable they are forces of solidarity even community they understand as the economist karl polanyiwrote that there are two kinds of freedoms there are the bad freedoms to exploit those around us and extract huge profits without regard to the common good and there are the good freedoms freedom of conscience freedom of speech freedom of meeting freedom of association freedom to choose one s job that the bad freedoms destroy the bad freedoms championed by an atomized hyper individualistic consumer culture which kneels before the cult of the self have triumphed the death grip of the ruling elites was illustrated in recent days in madrid where world leaders refused during cop25 the united nations conference on climate change to take meaningful action to halt the climate emergency an existential threat to humankind the bankrupt ideologies of globalization and neoliberalism formulated and used to justify the consolidation of wealth and power as well as the ecocide that is devastating the planet have however lost their credibility neoliberalism the idea that once regulations on corporations and trade barriers are lifted and taxes slashed a society will prosper was always an absurdity none of its promises could be defended by the history and theory of economics concentrating wealth in the hands of a global oligarchic elite eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 percent of the world s population while demolishing government controls and regulations sending production to the global south privatizing public services and destroying labor unions does not distribute wealth allowing global speculators to use money lent to them by the government at virtually zero percent interest to buy back their stock does not distribute wealth permitting corporations to engage in structured asset destruction through inflation to strip assets through mergers and acquisitions to raise the levels of debt incumbency to enforce debt peonage on the public to engage in corporate fraud that includes the dispossession of assets does not distribute wealth the raiding of pension funds credit and stock manipulations and looting the u s treasury when the bubbles and ponzi schemes evaporate does not distribute wealth such actions funnel wealth to those at the top they create enormous income inequality and monopoly power they fuel discontent and political extremism they make the planet uninhabitable for most species they destroy democracy but economic rationality was never the point the point was the restoration of class power neoliberalism transforms freedom for the many into freedom for the few the idiocy of the intellectual gurus who sold us this ideology milton friedman friedrich hayek and ayn rand should have exposed the con from the beginning but they were given ample platforms while their critics the old keynesians were pushed out and silenced freedom became equated with freedom of market forces to do anything the capitalists wanted and that freedom doomed us and looks set to doom the ecosystem on which we depend for life karl marx in volume one of capital explained over a century ago how freedom of the market always results in social inequality the loss of credibility of the reigning ideology has led the ruling elites to forge an alliance with right wing neofascist demagogues such as trump and johnson who employ the tropes of racism islamophobia homophobia bigotry and misogyny to channel the public s growing rage and frustration away from the corporate elites and toward the vulnerable these demagogues accelerate the pillage they accelerate the hatred racism and violence that act as a diversion and they accelerate the social unrest that becomes the excuse for the imposition of tyranny hope lies in the streets millions of people in hong kong india chile france iran iraq and lebanon understand it is time to join them

source xinhua 2019 12 30 22 08 22 editor huaxia video player close beijing dec 30 xinhua world markets in the coming year will be heavily exposed to eased yet continued uncertainties in global economy and trade analysts say they believe that trade disputes global growth slowdown brexit and geopolitical incidents will remain the major factors that will keep up pressure on the market and weigh on investor sentiment in fact a vulnerable challenging market amid mixed expectations is already signaled by price hikes simultaneously in both risk and safe haven assets at the end of 2019 as a relaxed monetary policy carried out by major central banks has enabled greater market liquidity higher gold price the gold price was on the rise in 2019 with gold futures on dec 27 closing about 18 percent higher than a year earlier at the new york mercantile exchange nymex that the u s federal reserve cut interest rates three times and that global central banks continually increased gold reserves were among the moves driving the gold price up to as high as 1 560 4 u s dollars from some 1 280 dollars per ounce early this year new heights in the gold price are anticipated in the coming year in response to potential risks from global political uncertainties and trade disputes for investors while central banks are expected to continue the relaxed monetary policy amid slow growth and moderate inflation buying gold is considered an effective offset to falls in the stock market or impact from geopolitical tensions the u s investment bank goldman sachs predicts the gold price will exceed 1 600 dollars per ounce in 2020 and that global central banks whose 2019 purchases of gold bullion total an estimated 750 tons will add to their gold reserves weaker u s dollar the u s dollar rallied in strength in late 2019 with the u s dollar index measuring its value relative to a basket of the top six currencies to nearly level that at the end of the previous year the u s dollar s ascent which is compared to a history of declines in the wake of the u s economic slowdown and fed rate cuts is attributed to investors confidence that u s treasury bonds are a safer option and the fact that u s rates have stayed above those in developed economies such as japan and the euro zone however a weaker u s dollar is expected in 2020 as the market is relieved of worries by an expected lessened slowdown in global growth bringing it down may also be the white house s employment of a devalued u s dollar to stimulate exports or the fed s decision to maintain low rates according to an article published online by the british weekly the economist the decisive downturn in the u s dollar s destiny is yet to come but the groundwork is being laid oil market still up the past year has seen the oil market seesawing before ending remarkably higher while trade frictions are threatening global growth and market demand geopolitical risks and the extension of oil supply cuts by major oil producers drove the oil price up the nymex wti light sweet crude oil futures on dec 27 closed 36 percent up from at the end of 2018 while the ice brent crude futures contract at the london exchanges recorded an increase of 27 percent analysts believe the international oil market will remain vulnerable to multiple factors for example organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and non opec producers have agreed on an extra cut of 500 000 barrels in daily output in the first quarter of 2020 however the collective reduction amounting to 1 7 million barrels a day will be partly offset by increases in oil production by countries including the united states and brazil the u s crude output in 2020 is officially forecast to hit 13 2 million barrels a day up by 900 000 barrels from the 2019 level despite a foreseeable declining share in worldwide energy consumption in the long run the market demand for oil in the coming year is believed to stand slightly above 2019 thanks to an anticipated economic recovery and ease in trade tensions in the meanwhile increased financial market risks and a softer u s dollar would help send oil prices higher stock markets to gain stock markets worldwide were in 2019 mostly bullish contrary to the macroeconomic trend an exception in the united states the dow jones industrial average on dec 27 rose about 29 percent from the beginning of 2019 while the nasdaq composite index was up about 36 percent stock markets also gained elsewhere considerably in major european union countries and japan but not so much in emerging market economies analysts attribute the gains mainly to the adoption of a relaxed monetary policy by major central banks and the distinguished performance of the u s stock market to a stronger u s dollar in particular amid a halt to rate cuts by central banks stock markets worldwide are gaining an upward momentum from the improved global economic outlook hopefully with surges led by emerging market economies in 2020 provided that the global trade situation will not worsen meanwhile some analysts predict a limited stock market performance worldwide next year without excluding a u s pullback saying the markets especially the u s market have been overvalued
abigail disney remembers the moment two decades ago when she no longer wanted to fly on her family s private plane disney is the granddaughter of roy o disney who founded the disney company with his younger brother walt in 1923 and her father was a longtime senior executive there abigail s parents owned a boeing 737 one of the largest private aircraft models on the market and they let her use it for family trips for many years when abigail was raising her four children she would take the plane to ireland to visit her mother s castle the plane was like a flying playpen abigail told me recently i ve known the pilot since i was a teen ager one day when her children were older she took an overnight flight from california to new york where she lives she was travelling alone but there was a full staff on duty to cater to her needs as she got into the queen size bed and secured the safety belt that stretched across the mattress preparing to sleep for the next few hours an unpleasant feeling came over her i couldn t help thinking about the carbon footprint of it and all the fuel she said it just felt so wrong it wasn t the first time that abigail who inherited part of her grandfather s fortune had experienced discomfort about her wealth and how little she had done to deserve it as a child she would go with her grandfather to disneyland where she was treated as a special guest he loved taking us to the front of the line she said she would hang her head as they marched past other families who had been waiting for rides in the hot sun i d say grandpa they hate us she recalled and he d say i worked so hard all those years so you could go to the front of the line as a young adult disney forged her own life in new york city first as a mother and later as a documentary film producer she eventually stopped flying on the private plane although it took a year or two these things are hard to give up she told me and she started advocating for peace and women s equality in 2011 she joined an organization called the patriotic millionaires a group of wealthy americans who are concerned about rising income inequality and who speak out in favor of policies traditionally considered to be antithetical to their economic interests she began to make public appearances and videos in which she promoted higher taxes on the wealthy she told me that she realized that the luxuries she and her family enjoyed were really a way of walling themselves off from the world which made it easier to ignore certain economic realities coming face to face with it feels fucking awful she said that s why the wealthy have the private planes and the bottle service in the back and the limousines with the tinted windows in march 2018 she received a facebook message from a custodian at disneyland who was asking for help he said that many workers there were barely able to survive on what they were paid and that their union was fighting for a fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage without success the local press had recently published several sensational reports about disneyland including a story about a sixty one year old night janitor at the disneyland resort who had died alone in her car where she had been living that year the walt disney company had reported almost thirteen billion dollars in profit the night janitor was estimated to have been earning thirteen or fourteen dollars an hour i spent almost a month sitting on it thinking what can i do abigail told me she is a shareholder in the company but has never had a formal role there and was wary of interfering in the family business it was hard for me to decide that i could take this on she said to learn more about what was happening she flew to los angeles and met with fifteen or so disneyland employees at the anaheim office of workers united local 50 an affiliate of the service employees international union that represents about seventy five hundred food service workers at disney theme parks i have a healthy skepticism about the way that unions characterize things so i was not inclined to simply accept whatever was told to me she said abigail had told the union representatives that she didn t want her visit to attract publicity so some of the workers were summoned to the office without being told whom they were meeting they sat in a circle and talked about their economic struggles a full time hair stylist named rebekah pedersen told abigail that she too had often slept in her car abigail recalled that a thirty year veteran of the park said that she had also recently been homeless for a time and that some of the workers said that they were on food stamps a spokesperson for the company issued a statement saying we strongly disagree with this characterization of our employees and their experience at disney the company also said disney has made signiﬁcant investments to expand the earning potential and upward mobility of our employees the president of workers united local 50 chris duarte who attended the meeting told me that he could see that abigail was struggling to process what she was learning she didn t want to trash her family name he said the company does a lot of good things but to have this ugly thing in the closet i know it bothered her abigail spent the next few weeks working on an e mail to bob iger the company s c e o the walt disney company is one of the largest and most profitable media businesses in the world and in 2018 iger who that year announced a new streaming service and who had directed the company s acquisitions of marvel pixar lucasfilm and 21st century fox s film and tv assets received almost sixty six million dollars in total compensation that was more than fourteen hundred times the median pay of a company employee although some in the business world say that iger deserves his staggering salary because of the company s financial success abigail found the pay ratio disturbing it is something that the whole country is engaged in shaving every benefit off workers lives making sure they are living as close to the bone as is humanly possible she said iger has pointed out that his salary was unusually high in 2018 because of a one time stock award that he was granted after the acquisition of 21st century fox and as part of an agreement that he would remain at disney for three years his annual compensation was 39 3 million disney has defended iger s compensation package saying that he has delivered exceptional value for the company its shareholders and employees thank you for your e mail i will be out on a walk for the next twenty minutes and plan on barking remotely until my return cartoon by elisabeth mcnair copy link to cartoon copy link to cartoon shop shop in the u s executive compensation has increased on average by nine hundred and forty per cent since 1978 according to one estimate during the same period worker pay has risen twelve per cent income inequality hasn t been this extreme since the nineteen twenties a recent study by the economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman found that as a result of cuts to estate and corporate taxes as well as the 2017 g o p tax bill the four hundred richest americans pay a lower over all tax rate than any other group in the country in a times op ed saez and zucman wrote this is the tax system of a plutocracy in abigail s message to iger she argued that the company would be damaged by reports that some employees were being paid so little the press had been reporting rumors that iger was thinking about running for president and he had said in an interview that america was gravely in need of optimism oprah winfrey publicly told iger that she would canvass for him in iowa this was an opportunity abigail said for him to set an example by offering more generous wages she wrote you could become the leader of the most ethical multi billion dollar multi national business the world has ever known iger responded a few days later thanking her for her e mail he said that he was proud that there hadn t been any work stoppages during his tenure and he suggested that she follow up with the human resources department
spread the love as the curtain comes down on 2019 and we await the new year it is critical to reflect on the path the country s economy passed through in the past 12 months it was not an easy road for zimbabweans but the authorities did their best in trying to put the country s economy back on track when finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube accepted the job as finance minister he faced the daunting task of crafting a recovery plan with his impressive cv former chief economist and vice president of the african development bank and lecturer at the london school of economics and wits business school in johannesburg he was considered the right person that could help the country fix its economy and achieve upper middle income status by 2030 although things appear far from rosy it is wise to accept the job the second republic is doing to turn around the economy the professor admitted he is faced a mammoth task it s a very challenging job you have to understand complexities and be able to take things apart and understand how everything works he said in the first nine months of the year challenges related to price increases while fuel and foreign currency shortages made it difficult to reach higher levels of growth agriculture which used to be the mainstay of the economy and experienced a high growth rate of 12 percent in 2018 buoyed by cash crops and livestock production however saw some losses in grain yields in 2019 owing to late and below average rainfall patterns the high cost of inputs and disease outbreaks as a result the sector grew by a modest three percent the mining industry continued to grow significantly in 2019 driven by major minerals like gold platinum diamond and nickel this is despite the risk the country faced mainly related to foreign currency the revival of the manufacturing sector looks positive reflecting some benefits from ongoing ease of doing business reforms new investments improving aggregate demand and rekindling of business confidence in 2019 the sector grew by about 2 5 percent taking cognisance of drawbacks from instabilities experienced during the last quarter of 2018 and january 2019 as a result overall economic performance in 2019 looks positive at a modest 3 1 percent with much scope for improvements in the coming year as ongoing policy reforms and anticipated external support will boost the economy the country should note that a key objective of the transitional stabilisation programme tsp and the 2019 national budget was fiscal consolidation through containment of the fiscal deficit to sustainable levels in the year under review this was attained through broadening of the revenue base including curbing leakages and expenditure containment to date government has made progress in containing expenditure in the following areas treasury bills the unsustainable practice of financing the fiscal deficit through tbs and rbz accommodation has been discontinued government stopped the issuance of additional treasury bills at the end of october 2018 except roll overs this has ensured that government spends within its means and within the budget public wage bill in the same period treasury successfully retired 3 188 youth officers in accordance with cabinet s decision of december 5 2017 this made it possible to rationalise posts in the public service and address duplications of functions additionally government effected a five percent salary cut for senior government officials from the level of principal directors and their equivalent grades up to the presidium at the beginning of the year as part of widening the revenue base the government introduced a two percent tax replacing a previous five cents per transaction in october 2018 as of january 2019 electronic transactions tax raised us 98 5 million with the aim of raising us 600 million at the close of this year gross collections for the third quarter q3 of 2019 were 6 59 billion against the targeted 6 billion thereby surpassing the third revised set target by 26 55 percent compared to the same period in 2018 gross collections grew by 413 66 percent from 1 28 billion collected during the third quarter of 2018 on the other hand net collections recorded a growth of 349 17 percent from 1 19 billion that was collected in the same period in 2018 the positive variance is attributed to both inflation and zimra s voluntary compliance and enforcement strategies major contributors to revenue were individual tax company tax vat on imports excise duty dividends fees interests and remittances dfir withholding tax on contracts and tobacco levy on the other hand the year 2019 saw the introduction of a number of statutory instruments si si 142 of 2019 si 212 of 2019 and si 213 of 2019 in a bid to stabilise the economy the si introduced the foreign exchange rate between the zimbabwe dollar and the united states dollar the abandonment of the multi currency regime the criminalisation of transactions in foreign currency and the setting of penalties for individuals and entities who trade in foreign currency the review reaffirmed government s commitment to implementing the austerity for prosperity which was rephrased to building a strong foundation for future prosperity prof ncube revealed that he has revised the 2019 national budget by 50 percent upwards for 2019 government had set an initial budget of 8 1 billion with tax collections suiting 74 percent of the total expected expenditure about seven percent of the budget being matched by grants and the difference which is an equivalent of circa 1 6 billion was categorised as a budget deficit and would have been covered through borrowings from the private sector it was not an easy road for the country but many remain optimistic in the coming year in his 2020 national budget presentation prof ncube said government expects the economy to recover swiftly from the 6 5 percent projected this year to three percent growth in 2020 he said that the growth will be driven by better rainfall which will boost agriculture output by five percent and improved electricity generation at kariba power station treasury says growth will also be supported by improved macro economic stability recovery in aggregate demand increased foreign currency availability and better business confidence tax and non tax revenue collections are projected to be 58 6 billion while expenditure is budgeted at 63 6 billion leaving a budget fiscal deficit of 5 billion despite the hardships zimbabweans are facing the country should remain optimistic and united to strengthen the economy together zimbabweans will achieve the country s vision 2030 of becoming an upper middle income economy herald share this share

comment nearly 30 percent of malaysians polled by gallup in 2018 felt that they did not have enough money for food while 23 percent reported not having sufficient money for shelter these are two very essential measurements of economic security or the lack of these are shocking and scary figures for anyone who cares about the social cohesion of a society there are two points to note on this matter for starters such a situation did not happen overnight and its causes go way back beyond the time pakatan harapan took over in may 2018 these are structural issues stemming from the asian financial crisis pushed to breaking point by the sixth prime minister najib abdul razak s kleptocracy and profligacy second if we don t face up to the country s deeper and long term economic challenges measures taken by us risk amounting to a mere reshuffling of chairs on the deck of the titanic while most malaysians describe the current economic woes as a cost of living problem it is a not too hidden crisis that up to 80 percent of malaysians are experiencing economic insecurity through a number of factors most important among which are low wages cost of housing and cost of transport to deal with economic insecurity we will have to acknowledge that the economic model that got us here has reached its limits and there is a dire need to break free from the conceptual hold of old ideas with a new paradigm the trouble is that we will have to do all these amidst global headwinds the cost of living debate a brief history the cost of living debate is essentially a shorthand to describe collective economic insecurity the world bank must be commended for its latest malaysian economic monitor mem which is themed meeting ends meet in summary the world bank is saying that cost of living is a catchall shorthand that means very little in public policy terms the analysis in this mem has shown that overall price inflation is not currently a major contributor to the high cost of living in malaysia the world bank suggests that four conditions need to be looked into namely living costs and prices vary across geographical regions income is simply way too low households are consuming through debts and housing prices are beyond the means of most families i first met ibrahim suffian of merdeka center in 2003 when he had just started tracking public sentiments in malaysia in all polls that ibrahim did throughout these years cost of living has consistently surfaced as the top concern of the people polled during my first election debut in bukit bendera penang in 2008 we started each of our grassroots walkabout campaign by saying that bn stands for barang naik prices going up since the petrol price hike in 2006 and inflation as a result of the global commodity boom was painfully felt by citizens in urban areas the irony was that the suburban areas that lived on palm oil production were doing reasonably well because of high commodity prices after losing the two thirds majority and five states on march 8 2008 the fifth prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi was badly advised to increase petrol price by 40 percent on june 4 2008 this effectively signalled the beginning of the end of his time in power abdullah succumbed to a putsch led by najib in september 2008 and he announced that he would retire in april 2009 much as the fall of najib in 2018 was attributed to the 1mdb scandal the steep austerity drives in 2015 and 2016 more than 30 percent cuts to budget allocations in response to the fall in global oil prices in effect a revenue crunch the implementation of the goods and services tax gst in april 2015 and the lack of economic opportunities for ordinary malaysians played a huge part too the 30 percent depreciation of the ringgit since october 2014 also contributed to higher prices of imports of course the icing on the cake was when the public witnessed the extravagant lifestyle of rosmah mansor which reminded them of marie antoinette at the heart of the matter najibnomics had no empathy for the small guy and no holistic understanding of economic insecurity of a large part of the population that required broad based and massive reforms to solve najib compartmentalised his thinking into capital economics and people s economics in short for him the objective of an economic policy was to serve the interests of those who owned capital and where the rest are concerned he simply gave them cash handouts such as br1m empowerment also doesn t enter his lexicon these are lessons for us in pakatan harapan to learn and to learn humbly and deeply economic security in its holistic sense better describes the problem at hand than the cost of living shorthand understanding insecurity beyond b20 and m60 labels in many ways up to 80 percent of malaysians live with economic insecurity in different degrees and extent but having similar concerns the world bank report made the point that there is a difference between the b20 group and the b21 b40 group recently professor jomo kwame sundaram and khazanah research institute s hawati abdul hamid have argued that members of the large b70 group have very similar social and economic needs these are calls for us to reconsider our basic policy terminology in 2011 the budget committee of pakatan rakyat myself included argued that the economy must give the bottom 60 percent more disposable income through better jobs and better pay this would enable the entire economy to benefit from sustainable growth driven by consumption that is not fuelled by debt the najib government however went for the band aid solution of cash transfer to 60 percent of the population and introduced the br1m in the 2012 budget if we consider the b20 group in the light of the united nations report written by un special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights professor philip alston which suggested that malaysia s poverty rate is most likely to be between 16 and 20 percent it appears correct to conclude that the b20 group as a whole are poor by most definitions beyond the b20 group the rest of the population perhaps excluding the top 20 percent the middle 60 percent b21 b40 m40 are almost in the same boat the government should therefore rethink the poverty rate definitions suggested by the united nations and move away from the b40 m40 dichotomy that is now looking like a rather meaningless distinction the m40 is not the middle class that one might imagine they essentially face the same problems as the b21 b40 they have middle class aspirations but they oftentimes have difficulty reaching the idealised status of the middle class a recent khazanah research institute report pointed out that about 20 percent of the m40 is misclassified because the household size was not accounted for a household officially classified within the m40 income class but having many familial dependents shares similar financial burdens as the b40 class our statistics understate the financial hardships of a substantial number of ordinary malaysians these labels have serious material and policy consequences which is why we need to discuss and consider them carefully instead of imbibing them uncritically in official circles there is a tendency to see the b40 not only as poor people but also as passive people who lack agency if we make such an assumption about them from the very start we will end up assuming that giving some token handouts to these poor souls is enough to solve the problem najib ended up giving 60 percent of malaysian households br1m which was actually a back handed admission that 60 percent of malaysians didn t live well under his watch najib and his team weren t thinking straight when they proposed the implementation of gst you can t be giving handouts to 60 percent of the population and then want to tax them through gst which taxes those who do not qualify to pay direct tax it was badly advised taxing people who do not have enough for food and shelter is a sure recipe to invite trouble the b20 poverty category as defined by the united nations needs welfare but in the malaysian context it appears that the subsequent 60 percent let s call them m60 for convenience need better jobs better pay better business opportunities better upward mobility for their children better housing options and better transport alternatives what this means for policymakers is that a national economic policy at this time needs to empower a large segment of the population if the country is not to deteriorate with a majority of our people living with a very deep sense of economic insecurity a paradigmatic shift is needed here lies the shift in hard policy thinking and communications that the government must embark on in the months and years ahead to bring the nation to the next stage when there is heightened economic insecurity across a vast segment of citizens any adverse headwinds small or big such as a trade war another economic crisis or the start of a monetary tightening cycle a fall in the ringgit or a cut in subsidies would cause panic and uproar to recognise that up to 80 percent of our citizens face some form of economic insecurity and to intervene from this basis help prevent systemic failures such as the massive revolts recently seen on the streets in south america the malaysian state has always maintained a significant level of intervention in the economy this is good since it reflects a conviction that not all things should be left to the markets the state holds the responsibility in reining in the excesses that markets as a rule are prone to this responsibility is easily misused though once the state is captured by vested interests or maybe inertia i had an interesting chat with a tycoon recently to my utter surprise he of all people suggested to me that the government should start thinking about providing free housing for the needy i probed him further and it turns out that his point is this all governments will have to think ahead to prevent economic revolts of the type that have happened on the streets of chile and in other south american cities and in hong kong he reasoned that the economic system must either pay workers more or it must reduce the costs of housing and transport to him it is better for the government to pay for housing through taxes than for businesses to try to raise salaries fast enough to contain discontentment and despair of course at some point the tycoon should pay a bit more tax which he knows it as a means to keep the economy away from systemic failure put more neutrally the way our economy organises the dynamics of wages housing and transport will have to change to make most malaysians feel more secure note this is the first of a three part essay on economic security liew chin tong is the deputy defence minister and dap national political education director the views expressed here are those of the author contributor and do not

in the space of less than 24 hours sudan s transitional government has backtracked on its decision to get rid of fuel subsidies in 2020 a move that had sparked widespread anger among the country s population and civilian representatives on sunday sudan passed its budget for 2020 the first since the toppling of longtime ruler omar al bashir in april but any decision on the removal of subsidies has been postponed until at least march when the country plans to hold an economic forum sudanese finance minister ibrahim ahmed el badawi announced on friday that the cabinet had decided to remove the fuel subsidies increase public service wages by 100 percent the minimum wage rate currently stands at 425 sudanese pounds around 5 a month and introduce an increase in subsidies for health and education services sudan celebrates christmas publicly for first time in 10 years read more badawi who is a former expert for the world bank in washington said that subsidies for benzine and gasoline would gradually be removed starting in 2020 while subsidies for bread and cooking gas will remain he also stated that the government would assist 900 000 poor families with payments worth at least 1 500 sudanese pounds around 20 each month however the announcement was rejected by the forces of freedom and change ffc and the sudanese professional association spa which led the protests in sudan from december 2018 to april 2019 after a meeting on saturday between the council of ministers and the ffc faisal mohamed salih the sudanese minister of information and spokesman of the government said to enable more discussions with our people the council of ministers has decided to freeze the gradual lifting of the fuel subsidies until 2020 and to wait for the recommendation of an economic conference which will be held by that time to discuss all the economic difficulties we will gather the economic experts to tell us the best ways to get out the minister explained minister of trade and industry madani abbas added despite the fact the current way of subsidies is not fair as it goes to both the rich and poor people we decided to give time for more consultation with our people until march 2020 fragile position the rapid reversal over the subsidies question has exposed the fragile position of the country s new government as it set out to prepare its first budget after 30 years of rule marked by economic hardship sudan continues to struggle with a moribund economy saddled with around 60bn in foreign debt coupled with its debt problems the country remains isolated from the global financial system due to international sanctions has seen its manufacturing sector destroyed and faces a lack of hard currency after the loss of 70 percent of the country s oil revenues due to the independence of south sudan in 2011 the exchange rate of the us dollar against the sudanese pound has continued to rise even after the ousting of bashir reaching 90 pounds per dollar last week meanwhile inflation jumped from 40 3 percent in september to 60 7 percent in november according to figures given by sudan s central bureau of statistics the government had announced earlier that it intended to keep the inflation rate at 27 percent the 2020 budget includes an overall deficit of about 73bn sudanese pounds 1 62bn badawi said on sunday the budget has expected revenues of 568 3bn sudanese pounds 12 63bn and also includes increased spending for healthcare and education imf influence the international monetary fund imf has repeatedly urged sudan to float its currency and lift subsidies on fuel wheat and medicines in order to boost growth and investment last week the imf office in sudan said that khartoum needed to take bold and comprehensive decisions as well as reforms to stabilise the economy and reverse the country s declining growth in particular it called on the government to support reforms and improvements in the business and governance environment important step sudan s government and rebels agree on plan to end darfur conflict read more the transitional government announced a nine month emergency plan in october focusing on stabilising the prices of commodities combating unemployment and restructuring the budget in addition to reforming the banking sector however badawi s decision on friday to lift the subsidies sparked widespread anger among pro democracy protesters including the youth movement and resistance committees who threatened to once again take to the streets to protest against the 2020 budget this budget would worsen the situation and continue the economic policies of the old regime which throw the burden on the citizens according to the policies of economic liberalisation and that is unacceptable for us after the revolution the spa said in a statement shared with mee on saturday we urged the government to decrease the expenses of the public sector as well as the expenses of the military and security sectors and to increase income through the fighting of corruption and the retrieval of money stolen by the officials of the old regime and their allies the ffc had also rejected the entire budget calling for an intensive revision to its priorities and for it to be more realistic negative impacts kamal karar a member of the ffc s economic committee told mee that the adoption of economic liberalisation and a dependency on foreign loans and assistance would not help the collapsed economy left by bashir the donations and loans amount to more than 50 percent of the revenues of the economy and this has two serious negative impacts karar argued the first is the donors political preconditions and the second is the lack of realism of the budget because it depends only on speculations and promises from the donors which means the budget may collapse if there are any changes to the political agenda in the coming period the lifting of the subsidies contradicts the agenda of the revolution which calls for supporting the people s purchasing power tackling youth unemployment and improving access to health insurance and economic services unacceptable members of the resistance committees had also rejected the budget warning of more protests to bring it down ahead of saturday s climb down rashid ali a 40 year old member of the resistance committee in burri in northern khartoum told mee that they had met badawi two weeks ago and warned him not to lift the subsidies it s unacceptable after the revolution that the minister of finance has ignored our recommendations regarding the lifting of subsidies he stated hind al taybe from al kalakla also in khartoum vowed to go to the streets to bring down the cabinet of prime minister hamdok if they insisted on approving the current plan we are for economic reform that would put forward the right plan to combat corruption and bring back the money stolen by the old regime not to put a heavier burden on our people she stressed violent repression previous attempts at lifting subsidies sparked widespread social tensions in sudan nationwide protests in september 2013 ended with the killing of more than 200 demonstrators by bashir s forces sudan opens darfur crimes probe against former bashir officials read more the soaring rise in prices was the main motive of the beginning of the revolution in december 2018 when protests that started in atbara city in the north spread to the capital khartoum and other states ffc spokesman ibrahim al sheikh said that the decision to freeze the lifting of the subsidies was a victory for the revolution and gave assurance to the people that the partnership between the ffc and the government remained strong the meeting of today is historical as we agreed on the entire articles of the 2020 budget in a way that would not affect poor people negatively said sheikh this is an opportunity to resize the government however economic expert hamid eltgani ali criticised the actions of hamdok s government emphasising the importance of setting priorities including achieving peace and decreasing expenditure on the military and security forces hamdok needs to come up with a master plan outline the choices in front of his government and engage in open discussion ali told mee the fiscal conditions are unsustainable how and when to conduct fiscal reform no one wants the transition government to go and borrow like what happened in tunisia during the transition this is an opportunity to resize the government and make it more effective hamdok needs to lead the discussion because lifting the subsidies is a political issue until now hamdok is running the public relations side but not engaging in wider and serious policy discussion with experts and civil society he is surrounded by political hacks driven by ideology and political opportunism it is hardly to run a country by pr the most important choice is to have peace and national reconciliation and restrain spending on defence and security use the peace dividend to spend on health and education while reducing the subsidies on food and fuel over several years

silver tries to move higher but was stopped chuck offers an idea to help the economy good day and a marvelous monday to you well i m back if only for two days this week today and thursday as tomorrow we will put a bow on 2019 and pack it away and tradition calls for me to sleep in to prepare for the night ahead and then wednesday is recovery day as we start the new year so how was your christmas holiday mine was fine my grandkids were so darn excited and happy we celebrated kathy s birthday well she did i was stuck at home with a flare up of the gout ouch man that stuff is painful al stewart greets me this morning with his song on the border i was swamped with news articles while on vacation i tried to read them all but my heart just wasn t into it the currencies had their normal chuck is away rally going for them as the dollar was getting sold on a daily basis i did read one article last week that said that european traders are betting that the euro has a good 2020 that would mean that they truly believe the dollar s long running strong trend had come to an end because if that was to happen in 2020 and i don t see why it wouldn t then that would mean the dollar is getting sold like funnel cakes at a state fair remember last year around christmas when the stock market got whacked one day and the next day it rebounded well this year in the year of opposites that we ve discussed previously silver took a flyer on the day after christmas and rose 38 cents before the boys in the band showed up late per their agreements with the boss and took silver back down by 23 cents so that silver showed a 15 cent hike on the day which in any normal day would be great but had the price manipulators not shown up imagine where silver would have ended the day come on john lennon told us in song that to imagine it s not hard to do and then on friday with all the boys in the band back at their desks they brought silver back below 18 00 phooey why couldn t these dirty devils had just stayed home to finish the holiday week like everyone else did gold saw the same kind of action rising furiously on thursday but then getting sold to make the day not look so good and on friday it lost more ground to bring it back to 1 510 nothing like finding large price increases as your gifts under the tree and then have them taken back later in the day as you try every other new toy you received i m just saying speaking of gold there was a report late last week that russia is considering allowing their wealth fund to invest in gold now that would be another buyer of physical gold in large quantities folks and that just has to have the price manipulators shaking in their collective boots now we re not talking about a sovereign wealth fund the size of norway s which is the largest in the world but 124 billion is nothing to turn your nose up folks and this is not to say that the entire 124 billion would be going to gold but a conservative allocation to gold would be anywhere around 15 20 so being conservative my training i can t help it that would indicate that it s certainly possible that the wealth fund could be allocating up to 18 billion in physical gold again got gold i read last week that sweden is giving up on their experiment with negative rates seems they weren t the cure all for the swedish economy that they had though they would be if they had only read the pfennig and listened to me as if right keeping in the region with the price of oil rallying last week due to supply concerns the norwegian krone has picked up some speed on the rally tracks with the euro looking perkier these days along with the price of oil the krone has a stream of green lights to fly through and it s doing so speaking of the price of oil as i said supply concerns and rumors that the shale producers in the u s are dropping like flies really has pushed the price of oil higher and this morning it trades with a 62 handle the thing i like about this move is twofold 1 i filled my gas tank in my car a week ago before the oil price rally started which should keep me good until i leave for florida next week and 2 more importantly the petrol currencies led by the russian ruble have really taken the oil price rally to heart the ruble loonie krone real and shoot rudy even the peso have boarded the rally train if i read one article on how badly americans are saving money last week i read a dozen of them seems it s on everyone s mind these days these days i sit on cornerstones and count the time in quarter tones to ten sorry but whenever i type these days the old jackson browne song pops into my head and then to my fat fingers so i digress what else is new eh nice to know some things don t change right ha i won t bore you with all the details but a very large number of americans don t have savings at all and another large number don t have enough for a 1 000 emergency and if you lived in my house those things would be going on all the time i only tell you these things about americans because we re supposed to be doing fine right because we are americans it s our right to be prosperous as if we all certainly have an opportunity to be prosperous but somewhere along the line we get off track and then i have to explain to people how this situation does not help our economy one iota because we as a country depend so much on consumption in other words people spending money but they can only spend what they don t have for so long before the collectors begin to knock on the door so they stop spending and the economy goes to hell in a hand basket i ve told this story before so if it s not your thing go ahead and skip ahead you won t hurt my feelings and lordy that s an important thing these days eh ok here we go my longtime friend and former big boss frank trotter and chuck were in bermuda for a conference and in frank s presentation he talked about walking through a graveyard in bermuda and seeing that the reason for death for many on the tombstones was the word consumption so what way should we be looking at consumption a good thing or bad thing when i wrote for the now defunct dow theory letters wait come to think of it i ve written for two publications other than the pfennig in the past and both of them went belly up you don t think me being a part of the editorial group had anything to do with that do you nah couldn t be must be a co inki dink so meanwhile back at the ranch i wrote a piece that went into great detail how the u s stock market gets very weak during recessions and i read last week that doug casey old time friend said that he believed that this next downturn would turn to a depression and since we ve had 1 and one half depressions here in the u s to use as historic markers stocks get shellacked during depressions ok so i don t think you woke up this morning turned on your computer or your smart phone or tablet to read the pfennig to get all depressed right from the get go so i ll stop there and talk about something else the u s data cupboard sure was on holiday last week like the rest of us but did yield another piece of negative data when durable goods orders printed negative 2 0 for november and the all important capital goods orders failed to meet the roctober print of 1 1 and gain only 1 i ve gone over capex capital expenditures many times in the past so i won t linger here too long but just to remind everyone that when the tax reform act went into place i said that it would not help the economy as it was not about you and me but about corporations who would not use the tax savings on capex but instead use it to buy back shares to guarantee large year end bonuses i sure did nail that one eh before we head to the big finish today and the last time this year i wanted to talk a bit about something i ve talked about previously and that is the fed s interest rate that they pay for excess reserves that the banks hold at the fed in other words the fed is in competition for these funds and they guarantee return of capital so the banks pile cash into the fed instead of putting the money to good use in the economy where the risks certainly are greater but with increased risk come increase interest rate spread right so what s going on here have bankers lost their collective appetites for risk or do the scars of 2007 08 run too deep and remain on the minds of these bankers either way the way that david stockman figures the numbers are interesting he says that the fed pays and interest rate of 1 55 right now there s about 1 5 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system that computes to about 23 billion the fed pays out annually so think about that for a minute that s a very large sum of cash that could be in the economy instead of sitting idly at the fed in my humble opinion the fed should cease this operation or at least pay an interest rate that doesn t make sense for bankers to hold 1 5 at the fed i know no one asked chuck what he would do first to help the economy but i thought i would throw that out there and see if it sticks ha to recap the currencies had their usual when chuck is away rally last week and are looking toward ending the year on a high note gold silver had an interesting couple of days after chirstmas it a a year of opposites for sure and i m hoping that it ends tomorrow night sweden is going to end their negative rates experiment and that s a good thing to chuck s way of thinking for what it s worth ok i ve been writing about how inflation is much higher than the stupid cpi gov t index shows and while i was on vacation i came across this website that takes out all the hedonic adjustments and calculates inflation based on what people need and buy and guess what they proved me correct as if there was any question ha so today s fwiw is simply a trip to that website to see that inflation in the u s has been running 10 5 in the 10 largest cities of the country now that sounds correct to me i don t know about you but if you live a normal life and buy things you know darn well that inflation isn t the stupid cpi s 2 figure so with all due respect none from where i sit to the folks at the bls i m going to footnote this website and refer to it in 6 months because that s the next time they ll issue the report chuck again not that i went anywhere but here i am beaming like a ray of sun because after all this time i ve been proven correct i knew it in my heart of hearts but everyone likes to laugh at me and say i m wrong because the bls says so well not any longer

one main theme echoes through economic predictions for the beginning of the new year financial analysts see strong indicators of global economic stalling or even shrinking u s money reserve produced the big easing to clearly explain these concerning economic factors how they have historically impacted the u s and world economies and of course the steps that prudent people can take to protect their finances take a moment to review a summary of this free e book and then download it from the resource library economic indicators of a shrinking global economy after a relatively healthy expansion in the past couple of years global growth slowed to anemic rates in 2019 the international monetary fund imf described growth as subdued and highlighted trade tensions tariffs political tension and political policy the organization for economic growth and co operation oecd lowered growth projections for 2019 from 3 2 percent to 2 9 percent the slowest growth rate since the dark days of 2008 while some economists believe that governments and central banks should intervene more others caution that previous interventions have sparked bubbles with their inevitable collapses debt loads and other financial woes that undermine stability in any case most people have little control over the actions of governments and big banks the best they can do is understand why forecasts for global growth have grown so pessimistic and how to protect themselves against uncertainty the big easing explores three main areas of economic concern these include low interest rates trade wars and weak consumer spending 1 lower interest rates during 2019 many of the largest central banks lowered interest rates these included central banks in the u s the e u china russia and several more japan denmark and a handful of other nations even declared negative interest rates an odd situation that forces banks to pay fees to store money either way this policy hurts savers and bank income and sparks inflation it also encourages debt bubbles because borrowers have more incentive to borrow and little motivation to repay loans quickly 2 trade wars the united states put new tariffs on 550 billion in trade goods from china including high demand items such as phones steel aluminum and panels in turn china reciprocated with 185 billion in new tariffs on such goods as fruit wine soybeans and cars the first impact was felt by u s industries and it was also reflected in the stock and bond market neither china nor the u s operate in a bubble of course trade disputes between two of the largest economies in the world do not end at their borders they affect international transportation trade and productivity in response international groups of finance ministers have encouraged dialogue over the disputes for example the head of asia economics at oxford economics louis kujis warned that export dependent countries and emerging economies were particularly vulnerable to trade wars between larger economies 3 weak consumer spending despite some positive job numbers from washington the u s economy is also displaying clear signs of distress for instance august 2019 consumer spending and business investment numbers had softened versus previous months while the fed cut interest rates for the first time since the great recession u s businesses have reduced or delayed spending in a number of areas including hiring across the ocean china s economic growth stalled to the slowest growth rate in three decades this occurred despite such economic stimulus attempts as lower interest rates for small business loans this news prompted bill clinton s former treasury secretary to comment that we may be entering the most dangerous financial times since the recession of 2008 2009 what does this grim financial news mean as central banks across the world appear to embrace extreme monetary policy debt keeps ballooning while trade is decelerating in addition the european purchasing managers index or pmi declined sharply in the fall as new orders sunk to 2012 levels french production also fell short of prior forecasts and italy spain and ireland all declined currently analysts say that german manufacturing has entered a recession the no deal brexit news has also put pressure on u k finances predictions for india s economic growth have been reduced for both 2019 and 2020 meanwhile china was struggling with its trade war with the u s for a while the u s economy still appeared to shine yet economists still see troubling news in the exploding deficit falling bond rates and the impact of the trade war on farms factories and other sectors the very monetary policy that the fed has pursued to hold up the u s economy may have actually reduced the country s ability to respond to a challenging economic climate to understand what this could mean people can simply look at recent history the most recent time when the economy stalled out this way the world entered a recession in the fourth quarter of 2008 gross domestic product fell more than six percent which was the worst drop in the previous quarter of a century at this time the world suffered a downturn that affected both consumers and companies how to protect savings portfolios from a sluggish economy during the last big recession savers saw large drops in the market value of their money equities and even real estate at the same time precious metals held their market value and even enjoyed steep price increases in particular gold rose to an all time high of more than 1 900 an ounce by 2011 when other markets had gone south some prudent savers had added gold and other precious metals to their assets as a type of wealth insurance goldco reviews in 2022 fees bbb complaints is it legit yes these valuable metals acted as a store of market value upon which people could rely as a source of security and cash when other savings and assets declined while gold such as the ones on and silver tend to hold their market values they really shine when other financial products tumble there is a strong negative correlation between other markets and the market value of precious metals often gold enjoys

pushing on a string from 2009 back in 1973 gold standard advocate john exter made a phrase famous in hard money circles pushing on a string exter argued that prices of all assets except gold he ignored silver would someday collapse because of the pyramiding of debt banks would eventually cease to lend out of fear of default that would cause the default the fed would inflate the monetary base he said but this would not reverse the price decline the commercial banks would not lend the fed would therefore push on a string its attempt to inflate would fail exter had been a central banker sri lanka and a senior officer at citibank he was the first deflation predictor in the hard money movement he was soon joined by c vern myers his argument remains the central pillar of the deflationist camp a tiny band of intrepid non economists who have seen their founder s prediction refuted by the facts in every year since 1973 but economic events since mid 2008 seem to indicate that exter may have been right they insist they continue to predict price deflation the fed is at long last pushing on a string i still predict price inflation just as i did in 1963 1973 1983 1993 and 2003 a gridlocked debate the debate between those who predict price deflation and those who predict price inflation is gridlocked today the rate of price increases both the cpi and the median cpi in may 2009 was 0 1 per annum that is as close to zero as statistical indicators get the cpi has been showing slight price deflation this year the median cpi has been showing slight price inflation statistical sampling errors and theoretical conceptual errors can affect the outcome of either indicator what we have seen is essentially a flatlined price level as i have previously written to decide which is coming a 2 fall in prices or a 2 increase flip a coin nobody in either the deflationist camp or the inflationist camp is playing cassandra based on 2 moves nobody cares about 2 moves not congress not the fed not the general public and not investors what matters is the sustained direction of prices year after year at rates above 2 per annum if prices fall long term debt contracts favor creditors these contracts become oppressive consider 30 year bonds corporations and the u s treasury will be paying appreciating money for old debt corporations can recall the debt by borrowing money and paying off old bondholders this is why corporate bonds are asymmetric bondholders get killed during price inflation with the accompanying rise in long term rates they get killed in price deflation because of pre payment with u s treasury bonds pre payment has never taken place previously but it could if prices increase above 2 per annum then previous contracts favor borrowers who pay off in depreciating money there are more borrowers who vote than creditors who vote this is why democratic politics always favors long term price inflation inflationists point to the increase of the balance sheet of the federal reserve system which has shot up faster than at any time in the post world war ii era see for yourself they conclude serious price inflation lies ahead deflationists point to the m1 money multiplier which is headed sharply down see for yourself this is the result of decisions by commercial bankers to lend money to the public no vs pile up excess reserves at the fed yes banks are not lending deflationists conclude serious price deflation lies ahead inflationists respond to the falling m1 money multiplier along these lines bankers must pay depositors a rate of return the banks are being paid by the fed for excess reserves but only at the federal funds rate barely above 0 if banks do not start lending they will be bled dry by payments to depositors the bankers at some point must lend if only to buy treasury bonds that pay more than what banks pay depositors deflationists reply along these lines bankers are afraid of losing money they will not lend until the economy turns up but it cannot turn up unless borrowers apply for loans and banks respond by lending meanwhile real estate prices continue to fall foreclosures continue to increase and banks continue to lose capital thus lowering their balance sheets they will not lend the m1 money multiplier will stay low offsetting increases in the fed s balance sheet which serves as the banking system s legal reserves who is right we don t know yet neither does bernanke is the fed impotent is it trapped in a corner frantically pushing on a string is price deflation an irreversible force i don t think so here s why central bank balance sheets both debt and equity every school of economic thought except the austrian school trusts either the government or the central bank to kiss it and make it all well when the economy stumbles the greenbackers and populists trust the government everyone else trusts the central bank the whole world is committed to monetary inflation as the supreme cure all for bad economic times whenever the economy slows the printing presses speed up those forecasters who are predicting price deflation argue that monetary inflation will not be powerful enough to overcome price deflation nobody is predicting an actual decrease in the money supply short of some sort of banking gridlock and a complete breakdown of monetary transactions which no conventional analyst even considers since it is just too pessimistic to consider seriously like nuclear war if a central bank can legally monetize debt create new money by buying ownership of debt then why not the monetization of equity do you think a central bank won t have eager sellers of depressed shares when sellers of anything need money they don t care who will buy their assets with money only when they suspect that the prevailing monetary unit will not function as money in the near term future will they refuse an offer to buy this takes place in the final stages of what ludwig von mises called the crack up boom the mass inflation generated collapse of the division of labor why anyone worries about price deflation is a mystery to me with the power of money creation through the purchase of assets there is no theoretical limit to how high prices can rise because people associate rising prices of whatever they sell or own as a sign of prosperity there is always support for fiat money the deflationist says the banks can create credit but people may decide not to borrow this is true but why wouldn t they borrow because of their fear of falling prices debt repayment well there is nothing like a little mass inflation to chase away the fear of falling prices if people are afraid of falling prices and therefore refuse to borrow money even at 0 interest then the central bank can do the buying directly eliminate the middlemen if businessmen won t borrow money to produce future goods the central bank can go out and contract to buy commercial goods directly or else get the government to do this with newly created money this is the keynesian solution could the fed buy up all of the shares listed on the new york stock exchange legally yes what about buying up all of the mortgages held by fannie mae and freddy mac of course but wouldn t this be a financial revolution not conceptually only pragmatically the idea is inherent in central banking which stretches back to 1694 the bank of england if a bank can legally create money to buy an asset there is no theoretical limit to the kind of asset involved i wish people were willing to think through these implications but this is not an easy thing to do especially in the area of central banking where deliberate deception is fundamental to the entire operation thibaut de saint phalle the federal reserve system an intentional mystery my point is simple at a 0 interest rate people will usually borrow money to buy things but people who are in a financial jam will sell assets for money if central bankers can t get producers to borrow money at 0 they can probably persuade consumers to borrow at 0 but even if they can t persuade consumers to buy they can lend money to the government which will send the money to special interest groups those groups will take the money they will spend it at some low price such as free people will take the money that s why price inflation is in our future price deflation isn t short of a banking gridlock which is quite possible but an unpredictable event here is the fact of facts regarding central banking the central bank can buy any asset with its fiat money the stock market can fall and i believe it will but it can be saved from total collapse by fed purchases the fed can buy up america s capital on the cheap with fiat money the bond market can also fall and will if the fed starts buying equities on a mass scale there is nothing like free money to persuade people to buy and others to sell the worse the economy gets the more willing hard pressed capital owners will be to sell that points to two events 1 a stock market sell off and 2 the fed s eventual purchase of capital assets in order to prevent that most feared event among central bankers a banking gridlock where bank a cannot settle with bank b because bank c has not paid bank a general deflation don t bet on it fiat money moves the merchandise the great equity fire sale has begun the federal reserve is not yet buying equity it is instead lending to the federal government which is buying equity the government is buying equity on a scale never before seen in american history it is buying equity in the financial industry banks it is buying equity in the automotive industry chrysler and general motors the precedent has been set voters overwhelmingly oppose this policy but congress ignores the voters so does the obama administration autos so did the bush administration banks this is not happening only in the united states in a long detailed and funny article that appeared in late may in the london review of books john lanchester surveyed the transfer to the government of both risk and ownership of the largest banks in great britain the article was titled it s finished what was he referring to confidence in thatcher s capitalism but there is nothing to take the place of this confidence he says of course there is the economic ideology that has reigned supreme since the 1930 s i refer to keynesianism the mixed economy never went away neither did academic keynesians economic growth has yet to reappear anywhere in the west the rate of contraction is higher in japan and europe than in the united states trade is falling rapidly unemployment in the united states is shooting upward with no end in sight no one is predicting a reversal of this trend in 2009 optimists think it may stabilize by mid 2010 i am not one of the optimists in this scenario the federal government is expanding its percentage of the economy with at least a 1 8 trillion deficit this year and perhaps an equally large deficit next year the government is absorbing the net new capital of the nation the private sector cannot compete with the treasury the rollover of existing federal debt coupled with the deficit totals over 4 trillion a year where will capital come from to finance the recovery it won t the federal government is now the spender of last resort it is buying equity in firms regarded as too big to fail so far commercial banks are not buying treasury debt they prefer to keep excess reserves at the fed this is unprecedented in american banking history here are bankers lending money to the fed at 0 15 or thereabouts who could lend to the u s treasury to buy bonds at 2 5 5 year t bonds or 4 5 30 year t bonds they refuse they are so fearful of the u s government s promise to pay that they have decided to stick with 0 15 they trust the fed far more than they trust the treasury keynesianism teaches that the government is the borrower of first resort in order to be the spender of last resort keynesians cheer the federal deficit they want the government to replace private borrowers as the borrower of last resort they do this because keynes and his disciples have believed that spending not saving is the heart of economic progress they believe that consumer demand is the heart and soul of economic growth not per capita productivity they do not worry much about private investment in private enterprise which they do not trust during recessions they have faith in aggregate spending and they fully understand that when it comes to spending the national government is the undisputed champion when it comes to writing blank checks nothing matches the congress of the united states the magnitude of the deficit the magnitude of the federal deficit this year is beyond comprehension if the economy produces the estimated 14 trillion in goods and services this year the government s 1 8 trillion deficit constitutes almost 13 of the economy but this is way too optimistic government spending at all levels constitutes at least 40 of the american economy deduct most of this from the total output maybe 35 lew rockwell would say to deduct the whole 40 this cuts national productivity to 9 1 trillion the deficit then constitutes about 20 of the private sector s total output that s just the deficit that does not count this year s share of the rollover of the existing federal debt at least another 2 5 trillion the average maturity of the national debt is now 48 months the debt is now 11 5 trillion but i am taking the pre obama debt of 10 trillion whatever is tacked on this year must be rolled over next year where will this borrowed money come from these are the main sources 1 private american investors and their agents 2 foreign private investors 3 foreign central banks japan and china 4 the federal reserve system that s it a short list if these four do not fork over the money the u s government will be forced to default on some portion of its debt at some price higher interest rates they will fork it over rising treasury debt rates will suck in more money from the first three but before rates rise too far the fourth will intervene to buy more of this additional debt why because of the effect on the capital markets of rising treasury debt rates a deeper recession think higher mortgage rates and housing prices think stock market think corporate bond market think projects postponed the federal government will absorb any net increase in private thrift this year next year and the year after all of it there isn t a high enough rate of saving in the country to fund the treasury s debt the federal debt is a black hole the question is this will the loss of new savings at the margin force down the other capital markets stocks bonds and real estate i think it will i suspect that the deflationists think so too when will banks start lending there is no answer from economic theory their willingness to lend will depend on these factors 1 their balance sheets 2 their fear of private borrowers defaulting 3 their fear of t bonds rising rates falling prices 4 their fear of running out of income to pay depositors 5 the rate of interest on excess reserves fedfunds rate 6 their fear of nationalization at this point i offer my central response to the deflationists the federal reserve system can force the hands of commercial bankers at any time by charging interest on excess reserves for safekeeping the fact that the fed has not done this indicates that it accepts the present situation a collapsing m1 money multiplier it accepts the string let me put it even more sharply the string is central to federal reserve policy today it is not the fed s nemesis it is the fed s ally the present economy is the result of federal reserve policy bernanke tried to pop greenspan s bubbles but without creating a major recession that policy failed as i predicted it would from late 2006 until late 2008 the fed decided to lower the federal funds rate this is what it has always done in the past i predicted it would it also decided to swap treasury debt for the banks toxic assets i did not predict this this is bernanke s uniquely innovative policy but this policy has not led to a revival of bank lending the fed is pushing on a string this does not mean that the fed s expansion of the monetary base is impotent on the contrary it means that the fed can buy treasury debt hold down treasury interest rates and enable the federal government to buy equity in american businesses the government can lend as it lent tarp funds at 5 per annum the government can remain the spender of last resort it can become the investor of last resort this has already begun the fed knows it is pushing on a string it loves that string why because that limp string no commercial bank lending delays the advent of price inflation this has enabled the fed to achieve the following by doubling the monetary base the fed s balance sheet 1 bail out the big banks asset swaps 2 keep the banking system from imploding 3 bail out the federal government 4 bail out fannie mae and freddie mac 5 keep real estate from collapsing 6 slow price inflation to close to zero 7 keep t bill rates under 0 5 at what cost unemployed workers that is a small price to pay if you are a high salary central banker with a fully funded pension the fed s policies have not failed they have succeeded beyond bernanke s wildest expectations greenspan s bubbles are all popped price inflation is gone there is no price deflation either for the first time since 1955 the fed has attained its mandate from congress price stability greenspan s fed never attained the power over the economy that bernanke s fed now possesses the fed has been given almost complete regulatory control over the financial system congress buckled bernanke has been given a free ride the federal government now owns general motors keynesianism is having its greatest revival in 30 years so far the fed has won yet deflationists argue that the economy is in a deflationary spiral that the fed cannot prevent they do not know what they are talking about they never have conclusion the federal reserve can re ignite monetary inflation at any time by charging banks a fee to keep excess reserves with the fed anyone who predicts an inevitable price deflation does not understand that the present scenario is the product of legitimately terrified bankers and the federal reserve s board of governors at any time the fed can get all of the banks money lent but the fed knows that this will double the money supply within weeks this will create mass price inflation this is the central fact in the inflation vs deflation debate until the deflationists answer it with a unified voice they will remain as their predecessors remained people with neither a theoretical nor a practical case for their position so the fed waits meanwhile the federal government s share of the economy rises relentlessly because of the deficits this is not going to change in the next few years we are seeing keynesianism s last stand when it fails the fed will force the banks to lend then we will see mass inflation mass deflation

stagflation and hyperinflation so what inflation the banking cartel demands inflation of the currency supply the cartel encourages massive debt and collects the interest and fees they want inflation because it increases debt and repayment is easier with global debt at 250 trillion the cartel is successful governments account for a large percentage of global debt they spend more buy votes feed currency units to cronies and borrow to cover the revenue shortfall inflation makes the debt load easier to tolerate corporations want mild inflation to boost revenues profits and stock prices deflation is scary bankruptcies increase debts aren t paid loans go bad and the banking cartel is stuck with huge write offs individuals and corporations can t service their debt and face insolvency and bankruptcy stagflation such as the united states in the 1970s is dangerous for individuals corporations stock markets and governments consumer prices rise profits shrink and individuals suffer as their expenses increase faster than incomes unemployment expands government does something and deficits jump higher hyperinflation creates a disaster for almost everyone including governments corporations individuals and nations the currency dollars euros whatever buys almost nothing the supply of goods dries up profits plummet prices increase every day people riot and governments fail summary inflation is destructive and deflation stagflation and hyperinflation are worse too many currency units borrowed and printed injected into the economic system cause inflation which has been standard procedure since 1913 commercial bankers and central bankers encourage debt creation they enable excessive spending by governments this gravy train supports many politicians wall street lobbyists corporations bankers and the political and financial elite don t expect change a modified gold standard would end most consumer inflation but the world is not ready to return to monetary sanity many people and governments will resist the discipline of gold they ll claim that ever increasing debt deficit spending socialism keynesian economics and debt based currencies are great i encourage them to explain that nonsense to the residents of venezuela argentina and zimbabwe the bottom line is simple the political and financial elite need inflation of several percent each year however they want to avoid hyperinflation deflation and stagflation why examples examine the dow since 1971 on a log scale graph it rises exponentially because dollars buy less every year inflation

the log scale graph shows continual devaluation of the dollar the dollar will weaken in the coming decade is gold expensive compared to the dow both rise as dollars buy less the ratio of 10 times gold price divided by the dow shows that gold is inexpensive compared to 30 years of history expect a rising gold price compare the price of the nasdaq to silver the ratio shows that silver is inexpensive compared to the high flying nasdaq inflation is not dead how can inflation die when bankers governments individuals and corporations created over 250 trillion in debt they need weaker currency units to service the debt and inflate bubbles the debt bubble will eventually collapse but can kicking is a national pastime in governments inflate or die bloomberg published the following cover in april 2019 magazine covers are often contrary indicators that appear when a major change is about to occur inflation will accelerate as currency units are devalued more rapidly another example of consumer

ocean university of sri lanka and potential contributions to national development by dr ivan amarasinghe bsc hons phd mibiol cbiol ex chairman of nifne and former ambassador to viet nam introduction post independent sri lanka inherited an archaic system of limited vision and productivity within the fisheries and national aquatic resources exploitation policies of sri lanka while there were support agencies such as the fisheries department the national aquaculture resources r d agency and a few colleges of fisheries around the island teaching basic applied technology for fishermen and fishing boat navigation opportunities for ocean resources identification planning and exploitation were limited a new vision was born in october 2000 when the new minister of fisheries aquatic resources development the hon mahinda rajapaksa introduced the concept of a sagara vishwa vidyalaya an ocean university the dependence of our country on expensive international consultants and experts for national fisheries and aquatic resources development needed reappraisal our country had also spent vast sums of foreign exchange secured as international aid loans on unproductive and sometimes faulty and inappropriate development projects recommended by these foreign experts the unique way to alleviate such problems was to develop the national knowledgebase of the aquatic and ocean resources on a more holistic basis aimed at broader expertise on all ocean resources so that national capacity be optimised to international competence in addition to the ongoing dependence on foreign advisors for local development engagement in fisheries was constrained within the caste system whether it be the karaiar in the north or the karawes of the rest of the insular coastal belt there was a stark adherence to a caste based rigidly discriminatory coastal professional structure as an egalitarian national leader rajapaksa identified that a seat of learning of the highest calibre a university was a much needed first step not only to alleviate the above development problems but also create a more inclusive society sharing the ocean resources as a common heritage of the people than fisheries being the exclusive nametag of an underprivileged group within it the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos and its relevance to sri lankan development through an ocean university unclos is an international treaty adopted and signed in 1982 at the end of almost ten years of negotiations 1973 1982 it replaced the four geneva conventions which concerned the territorial sea and the contiguous zone the continental shelf the high seas fishing and conservation of living resources on the high seas unclos is the legal framework for global marine and maritime activities it defines the national boundaries of the ocean adjacent to a country these confines are not only lateral from the maritime coast to the deep seas but also vertically down to the seabed it allocates exclusive economic zones eezs for each country the convention came into effect in november 1994 currently 162 parties including the european union share its jurisdictions unclos itself was formulated through a un conference on the law of the sea in 1980 under the chairmanship of a retired sri lankan civil servant hamilton shirley amerasinghe he was also chairman of the ad hoc committee on the indian ocean he proposed that the indian ocean be declared a zone of peace unclos and the efforts of amerasinghe at the conference rewarded the island of sri lanka with legal rights to an oceanic expanse that was ten times larger than its land area it was granted an exclusive economic zone of 200 miles from the shores with a de facto responsibility of being the centre of the indian ocean as a zone of peace all these new developments through unclos affecting sri lanka and the indian ocean make the mahinda rajapaksa concept of an ocean university of sri lanka not only a relevant proposal but also a necessity knowing that 3 4th of the planet earth is covered by the oceans and that the unclos legally defines the extent of guardianship to allied oceanic states a centre of higher learning encompassing all affairs of the ocean is a necessary development the potential academic and consultative contributions for the betterment of states their maritime diplomatic relations conflict resolutions resources identification and sustainable exploitation would be immense unrealised opportunities and the need for reappraisal of development potentials the hon ranil wickramasinghe former prime minister of sri lanka indirectly accepted the failure of his government on oceanic affairs at the 2nd indian ocean conference in september 2017 colombo in his address he stated just a few hundred metres from temple trees is an ocean that is destined to define the future of the world sri lanka located enviably in the centre of the indian ocean is well poised to play a significant role in determining this future our shores are washed by the waters of this great ocean it has shaped us as a distinct people our future development is intrinsically linked to it and we share responsibility in keeping its waters safe we believe as people of the indian ocean peace progress and prosperity are goals that need to be pursued together despite these promising predictions intra trade in the indian ocean region including the bay of bengal remains low for example south asia remains the least economically integrated region in the world unlike the european and pacific nations there is an absence of political will to promote indian ocean economic cooperation more specifically trade liberalization and connectivity trade and connectivity are central to achieving and maintaining a high regional growth rate there is no doubt that wickramasinghe would have declared that sri lanka is proud of the contribution that the ocean university is contributing towards his dream of the indian ocean towards peace progress and prosperity as goals pursued together if only the hon mahinda rajapaksa initiatives of sagara wishwa vidyalaya as an international holistic centre for studies research and dialogue been developed further under a ranil wickramasinghe government instead of being ignored wickramasinghe s own words are an indictment on the performance of his own government the mahinda rajapaksa concept of a sagara wishwa vidyalaya was a landmark in the history of global higher education two years following the rajapaksa concept of an ocean university for the people china instituted the first ocean university in 2002 by 2019 the ocean university of china became a front runner in the world while the ocean university of sri lanka sunk to abysmal levels of being 23849th in international rankings this was far below even some of the private teaching institutes and colleges in sri lanka itself it is time to question as to why this globally exemplary higher education concept of mahinda rajapaksa failed miserably in his own country historical relationship between man and the ocean historically the oceans of the earth facilitated sailing to unknown lands for nations which sought friendly trade or subjugation and plunder of distant lands their resources and the people ancient chinese chronicles up to the seventh century denote regular visits by sri lankan known then as heladiva ships as trade vessels si lankan chronicles mention heladiva as a seafaring nation much of it being along the silk route through the s e asian seas the europeans used the oceans for all the benefits that other seafaring nations sought while they are more noted for establishing their own empires around the globe through cunning adventure and subjugation of distant peoples the british empire was based on the spiritual presumption that at heaven s command britain arose from out the azure main this was the charter of the land and guardian angels sang this strain rule britannia rule the waves britons never will be slaves the message was very clear those who ventured out to the oceans would prosper the end of the empire gave birth to the commonwealth which continues the appraisal of natural resources of its members in patronage as commonwealth countries are endowed with immense and precious natural resources these include millions of square kilometres of ocean space significant renewable wind solar and non renewable resources oil gas minerals when managed equitably and sustainably the exploitation of natural resources bolsters national resilience to economic and social crises improving prosperity for all citizens it promises to provide technical assistance and support member countries in the development of policies laws design of fiscal regimes and strengthening national institutions as they seek to implement the sustainable development goals while such altruism is commended some member states are keen to be independent rather than be dependent on technical assistance and national policy formulations of external benefactors the first step to achieve success in such futuristic ventures is to establish a knowledgebase with relevant competence in scientific technology and capacity building to formulate robust national policy to derive the benefits of sustainable exploitation and management of the national resources as an island within the indian ocean sri lanka has to develop bilateral multilateral and global relations which should ensure diplomatic friendship for those who seek right of passage within its oceanic space post colonial sri lanka must develop a seat of learning which would be a fountain of multidisciplinary competence to achieve national prosperity and global appreciation in the above goals the creation of the sagara vishwa vidyalaya ocean university of sri lanka by his excellency mahinda rajapaksa was based on those principles evolution of universities from ivory tower philosophy to grass roots applicability universities were historically treated as ivory towers of philosophical thinking nalanda st andrews oxford and cambridge were meant for erudite philosophical spiritual advocacy with concurrent governance advice to the national leaders with gradual acceptance of the need for scientific learning and applicable technology for welfare and development of society universities moved forward from ivory tower exclusiveness to an egalitarian wide purpose national and global stake holder three paradigm shifts from the traditional model of an university initiated by visionary political leaders open university harold wilson concept of an university in the air the most radical change in university education came in 1969 under the concept of a university in the air named the open university by the then british prime minister rt hon harold wilson this model did not advocate a single campus based lecture room where a lecturer or professor was the sole teacher of a disciplinary subject or unit instead it used a headquarters where teams of excellently qualified and experienced professionals defined the course to be taught and the contents of each subject the main teaching relied on new technology through media the radio television and computers course units were produced through panels of academics who formed the course developers and managers with appropriate inputs from specialists across britain the units were distributed to the vast student population within britain and in far flung corners of the earth and the oceans where british citizens were employed as defence personnel or other civilian and trade missions regular radio and tv broadcasts formed a supplementary role the print course material received by students as a labour prime minister wilson expected to promote greater equality of opportunity for all and social mobility for those wishing to educate themselves at any stage of their lives to achieve success in life today the open university is the biggest university in britain with a student population of over 147 000 the ou won the categories of teaching excellence and digital innovation in 2018 many countries across the world including sri lanka have their own version of open universities now colleges of technology to universities margaret thatcher concept of unification of the binary higher education model in 1992 the british prime minister the rt hon margaret thatcher revolutionised tertiary education in britain through her option of classification of reputed colleges of technology and polytechnics as universities vocational disciplines and applied research became the hallmarks of fame and fortune for these universities the newly empowered universities indeed surpassed the expectations of their early critics today some of these new universities are in the highest echelons of international academic ratings in addition they have offered vast opportunities to many thousands of british students who would otherwise have not had the opportunity of such entry to acclaimed universities the new universities excel in research and consultancy capacities the thatcher initiative has ensured vast foreign exchange earnings for britain through recruitment of foreign students to these hundreds of universities colleges of fisheries and nautical engineering to an ocean university mahinda rajapaksa concept of a university for integrated management of the ocean resources the third visionary model of a university is built on the traditional foundation of university learning and certification of attainment with a mission to assess understand and benefit from a vast array of natural resources within a waterbody the ocean surrounding the island of sri lanka in the introduction above the rationale of the honourable mahinda rajapaksa to develop this new concept of a university within a defined global space with clear holistic objectives concerning the oceans and to identify opportunities for a deprived class of people were mentioned his vision was that of a statesman as well as that of a minister in search of optimal ministerial policies for the development of his country the vision of the ocean university as freedom independence and sovereignty are the fundamental underpinnings of post colonial developmental resurgence in an island surrounded by a vast ocean then freedom of thought through education independence in policy formulation and hallmarks of sovereignty should spring from a fountain of knowledge such as an ocean university that was the vision of the minister of fisheries aquatic resources development hon mahinda rajapaksa the mission of the ocean university the mission to achieve the envisioned goals of the proposed ocean university necessitated the short the medium and the long term plans of action as the goals were diverse and comprehensive phase 1 nifne as a precursor to the ocean university before an ocean university could be established with all essential infrastructure teaching and research facilities cabinet approval and financial aspects the minister established a national institute of fisheries and nautical engineering nifne in 1999 as a testing precursor to a future sagara vishwa vidyalaya the nifne recruited outside the national university entrance selection criteria and lowered the entrance requirements to encourage the youth and professionals of the fisheries community to academia initially less than were selected for the undergraduate degrees of b sc in fisheries sciences and nautical engineering teaching was from the nara campus on rented office and lecture rooms the presence of the reputed nara staff within reach encouraged the teaching of undergraduates lectures and practical exercises were conducted by the best professors and senior academics of various sri lankan universities invited on lucrative rates of payments regional colleges mentioned above conducted certificate and diploma courses in a range of fisheries and fishing vessel knowledge experienced vice chancellors of peradeniya and ruhuna universities with erudite professors and senior professionals representing the various allied government ministries departments and agencies comprised the governing council of the nifne challenging circumstances due to pressures from various unions as commonly seen in sri lanka delayed the progress the convocation for the first batch of graduates of the nifne was held in 2007 with the hon mahinda rajapaksa now being the prime minister of sri lanka with the hon felix perera mp as minister of fisheries aquatic resources development very much similar to the upgrading of technological colleges to university status under the thatcher vision the rajapaksa concept incorporated the existing fisheries colleges to the ocean university the presence of the regional colleges of fisheries in jaffna trincomalee batticaloa tangalle galle mattakkuliya and negombo allowed a future usage of these as regional teaching bases on the distance education model of the open university of the uk phase 2 the establishment of the ocean university as a ugc approved ministry of higher education partnered national entity in 2014 the ocean university of sri lanka was formally established under the act no 31 the university grants commission ugc of sri lanka approved degree awarding status as university four undergraduate degree programmes in the fields of marine science and nautical engineering were approved the ocean university also continued the previous activities of the nifne to offer diplomas and certificate level courses and mobile programmes these were essentially treated as national technical vocational certificates to enhance the fisheries and coastal sector performance degree courses b sc in fisheries marine science b sc in marine engineering b sc in transportation management logistics b sc in coastal marine resources management and the diploma courses under water cutting and welding aquaculture and management course certificate courses diving welding and floating vessels mechanic the change of government of sri lanka following the election of the present president and the cabinet dominated by the unf in 2015 led to a virtual standstill of the progress of the newly established university the vision of an ocean university with multidisciplinary teaching research and training which served all stakeholders of the ocean resources appears to have evaporated the university has been assigned as a minor appendage assigned to vocational training skills development within a multi agency ministry of for industry commerce resettlement of protracted displaced persons co operative development vocational training skills development china the winner and sri lanka the loser when the rajapaksa seminal proposal of 1998 for a holistic academic and technological delivery befitting an ocean university was made there were no other such ocean universities around the world many countries such as norway japan and china had colleges of fisheries education some countries including sri lanka had departments of fisheries education oceanography maritime science etc within different faculties of universities apart from the rajapaksa vision of the 1990s to establish an ocean university china is the only country with a vision to follow suit china upgraded its shandong college of oceanology to ocean university of quingdao chairman deng xiaoping wrote the name of the university 青岛海洋大学 in his own calligraphic style to mark the occasion and in october 2002 it was officially established as the ocean university of china under the direct administration of the state ministry of education moe ocean university of china ouc is now a national key comprehensive university with particular strengths in oceanography and fisheries science ouc offers courses in science engineering agronomy fisheries pharmaceutics economics management liberal arts law education history and art there are 17 colleges and one teaching centre for fundamental courses and one department of social sciences ouc boasts 12 post doctoral research programs 81 academic disciplines majors authorized to offer doctorate degrees 193 disciplines majors for masters degrees and 69 undergraduate programs ouc is the cradle of china s marine professionals and it has graduated a large number of competent specialists in marine science for china 70 percent of ph d holders in oceanography and fisheries in china graduated from ouc the first scientist to reach the south pole the first chinese scientist to investigate the south pole were from the ouc while the ocean university of china ouc went from strength to strength and diversified the courses and degrees while making landmarks in global oceanic research the ocean university of sri lanka ocusl has virtually reverted to its nifne status this is reflected in the international university ranking too the five top ten universities in sri lanka are peradeniya 1981 colombo 2023 moratuwa 2495 ruhuna 2853 sri jayawardenapura 2960 jaffna 4296 rajarata 4383 open 4629 and sabaragamuwa 4894 in international rankings ocean university of china ranks at 697 while the ocean university of sri lanka ranks at 23849 this indicates an abject failure or wilful destruction of the eminent mahinda rajapaksa chinthanaya the losses due to such failure are to sri lanka and its people case studies worthy of appraisal at an ocean university for sri lanka singapore is often cited as an example of how a small peninsular state can reach the highest levels of national development and per capita income with a thriving ocean based international hub of trade it will be useful for countries such as sri lanka to study the oceanic contributions to such developments and advice the government on an appropriate pathway to emulate viet nam offers an example of a recently independent and fast developing country which needs application of unclos to assert its independence on the national territorial waters viet nam also has to engage in diplomatic dialogue with global superpowers such as china and the usa who seek to use vietnamese south china sea as an area of chinese as well as us american regions of global interests recently china renewed interests in the ancient silk route renamed as the belt and road initiative bri bri is essential for the global development strategy adopted by china to facilitate infrastructure development and investments in 152 countries and international organizations in asia europe africa the middle east and the americas the usa treats the same route as essential for their asia pacific and asia atlantic interests the problems that viet nam faces in recent times in exercise of its legal rights within its territorial waters due to these complex demands can be detrimental to its international trading peace and welfare similarly recent increase of chinese and us interests declared in sri lanka and within the unclos designated territorial waters of sri lanka need cautious handling through erudite appraisal the ocean university of sri lanka should offer an international centre for diplomatic and erudite contributions through a centre for international maritime trade and peace dialogue recommendations for a future government a new team of competent academics entrepreneurs administrators will be appointed to restore the ideals set out in the mahinda rajapaksa concept of an ocean university of sri lanka new university courses aimed at occupational and entrepreneurial aspects with delivery in new occupational and business opportunities shall be prioritised expatriate academics professionals and entrepreneurs and international diplomats must be invited to contribute with relevant new ideas teaching and other relevant assistance wider educational attainments research opportunities leading to international advisory consultancy opportunities shall be created opportunities for global bilateral and multilateral dialogue partners as erudite and competent specialists in the following subjects shall be introduced to produce professionals urgently needed for ocean based activities such as laws of the sea coastal and deep sea defence security b shipping transport logistics c ports and oceanic supplies to ships on the silk route d fisheries exploitation in co operation with neighbouring states e oceanography f coastal and sea bed mineral resources g shipbuilding h ports and harbours construction i regional and international trading j coastal tourism k climate change and its effects on coastal communities and coastal businesses l coast conservation m safety on the coast and the ocean n ocean generic natural disasters and mitigation o oceanic wave energy conversion to electrical energy the elimination of the globally archaic binary system of education replete with the thatcherite objectives of university delivery leading to direct tangible benefits to the people and the country shall be advocated the wilson concept of distance education in its open university model shall be introduced so that all people of the country will feel inclusive within the society in opportunities to better themselves through the ocean university this will be a blessing to the poor regional stakeholders as local centres will assist them those who a missed a higher education b wish to be at the cutting edge of academia and technology while in employment or c are socially handicapped should be encouraged to derive maximum benefit through regional based colleges radio and tv broadcasts teaching with 1 to 1 teaching assistance and care for handicapped students around the country will be commenced those qualifying from the ocean university shall be guided to postgraduate opportunities those needing special assistance in learning will be guided for success by specialist advisory teams a team of competent academics professionals of all ocean based interests and activities including entrepreneurs on oceanic resources exploitation and relevant government departments will assess all present university activities and summarise which types of new courses degrees and research must be prioritised for the next stage in the progress of the ocean university in its long term mission attainments for this an understanding of the successful courses at the ouc may recommended the existing academic board and the governing council should be consulted individually so as to collate their ideas for future progress new courses as recommended in 1 above must be launched through utilisation of national and international teachers partnerships with foreign national universities with specialist competence to develop new courses and research programmes must be sought a five year plan of resurrection to the rajapaksa vision of a sagara wishwa vidyalaya will be developed the sooner a future government of sri lanka restores the esteemed and valuable potentials expected of a multidisciplinary ocean university the better it shall be for a return to the development of sri lanka in expected delivery of benefits to the people and the state vast numbers of new employment opportunities for all sri lankans in a vast array of above activities such as coastal and deep sea resources exploitation offering of international services such as marine defence services to international clients will be consolidated through studies and education at a ocusl coastal and oceanic tourism exploration and production of ocean resources within sri lankan extended economic zone eez are other projected advantages the national problem of electricity generation can be solved through the use of oceanic wave energy wave energy is clean energy recommended by the global scientific community and climate change experts our continued use of fossil fuel to produce electrical energy is environmentally destructive enhances climate change problems and drains the national foreign exchange reserves the eight colleges positioned on the coastal belt of the island could be used as training and graduation centres for certificate courses at university level for example each college can commence courses of 3 6 month duration suitable for service in the tourism industry these may be developed in conjunction with the ministry of tourism and the private hotels sector within 3 5 years this will not only produce excellent service personnel for the sri lankan tourist industry but also for service in other countries that will boost the economy in billions of us dollars international accreditation of such personnel will enhance the reputation of sri lanka as well as attract foreign students for such courses there are a vast number of such courses in many disciplines which once initiated will attract much needed foreign exchange earnings to sri lanka coastal storage facilities such as those of the oil tanks complex in trincomalee can be used not only to store future petroleum reserves for the country but also as a facility for international distribution and allied logistics the economic enrichment to the country through such a facility will exceed those of singapore prospecting natural mineral deposits such as ilmenite and deep sea petroleum exploration and their sustainable exploitation will be taught with cutting edge research technology at the ocean university there are signs of vast deposits of yet unexplored or exploited cobalt within the sri lankan territorial waters instead of selling our national oceanic resources at extremely cheap prices e g ilmenite over the last five decades sri lanka can develop its own technologists through the ocean university thereby being capable of deriving the best capacity and economic benefits for sri lanka attraction of foreign direct investments from potential partners for such technological entrepreneurship in sri lanka will benefit local capacity excellence as well as national economic development the training of coastal tourist specialists as well as in hotel service staff will benefit the country and be a source of internationally recognised school of tourism studies and training accredited at reputed university diploma and certificate levels if a multinational and multilingual facility can be developed the ocean university of sri lanka may attract global trainees wishing to qualify in various aspects of coastal and oceanic tourism billions of us and other foreign exchange earnings to sri lanka through foreign student and scholar recruitment foreign ocean based job opportunities conferences and enhanced tourism will be tangible benefits of such activities through the ocusl enhancing the maritime defence services this will generate a vast income if sri lanka can continue to supply global maritime defence personnel and security services as done in the pre 2015 years earnings through port supplies and services may well exceed those enjoyed by such countries as singapore the new hambantota port as well as the ancient traditional port of galle renowned over thousands of years with oceanic silk route vessels should aim at such services through accredited professionals of the ocusl enhanced international reputation for sri lanka and sri lankans with the ocean university as a global hub on ocean affairs there are some eminent sri lankan professionals on ocean affairs presently employed as expatriates in various countries inviting them to serve the motherland would give vast strength to develop the ocean university to international reputation public private entrepreneurships encouraged through an ocean university will benefit sri lanka in a multitude of ocean associated enterprises final conclusion based on the above discourse and collection of factual data a team may be able to forecast the economic trade and employment enhancement contribution over the next 5 year period by a properly instituted ocean university based on the conceptual model of the vision of his excellency mahinda rajapaksa the calculated forecast figures should be broadcast to the public asap so that the public realises the value of returning sri lanka to prosperity

the odds of the u s slipping into a recession in 2020 are getting longer the probability of a downturn has fallen to about 1 in 3 following a tentative trade war truce with china and a resilient job market but that doesn t mean there won t be one here s the good news economists believe a recession that starts next year would probably be relatively short and mild more like the slumps of the early 1990s and early 2000s than the devastating collapse that led to nearly 9 million job losses during the great recession of 2007 09 that s largely because consumer finances are in good shape and there s little sign of the excesses like runaway inflation or housing or stock market bubbles that triggered previous slides the balance sheets of households businesses and banks remain strong says cristian deritis deputy chief economist at moody s analytics we have the capacity to absorb a recession restructure and see growth recover think of the 10½ year old economic expansion as a slow but steady jogger who gradually stumbles to a halt in the latter stages of a marathon but can quickly resume the race after a brief rest by contrast the mid 2000s economy that ended with the great recession was a sprinter who burned out and crashed dairy farmers milk new opportunities struggling dairy farmers building a future with hazelnuts specialty milk and creative thinking here s the rub the recovery from a recession that begins late next year is likely to be tepid as well partly held back by some of the same forces that cause the downturn it ll be a mild recession with a mild recovery says diane swonk chief economist of grant thornton a report by deritis shows the 11 recessions since world war ii can be grouped into three categories from 1948 to 1968 the u s experienced classic boom and bust downturns consumer and business spending surged prices soared and producers responded by making too much stuff leading to a shakeout and lower prices that revived demand the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s were marked by oil price shocks that dampened consumer spending and downturns since the early 1990s largely have been set off by financial bubbles or run ups that eventually burst for some perspective on where a 2020 downturn might fit here s a look at the past three recessions in the financial bubble era july 1990 to march 1991 the eight month long downturn was at least partly sparked by savings and loans institutions that ratcheted up lending for risky commercial real estate projects that went bust resulting in the failure of a third of the s ls and discouraging housing and other loans other factors included a leap in oil prices after the u s invasion of kuwait and earlier federal reserve interest rate hikes to fight inflation economic output declined by about 1 2 and the unemployment rate rose from 5 2 to 6 8 as 1 4 million jobs were lost but even after the recession ended employers continued to cut jobs or hire sparingly pushing unemployment to 7 8 by june 1992 and creating the first jobless recovery march 2001 to november 2001 the eight month slump was triggered by the collapse of the dot com stock bubble which led to a pullback in business investment also contributing fed rate hikes to fight inflation in 2000 the september 11 terrorist attacks and the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s economic output actually increased slightly during this mild recession but the unemployment rate rose from 4 2 to 5 5 as 1 4 million jobs were shed after the downturn officially ended unemployment continued to climb to 6 3 by june 2003 and nearly 1 million more jobs were lost in another jobless recovery economists have partly blamed the jobless rebounds of the early 1990s and early 2000s on financial meltdowns that chilled lending and investment a study by the kansas city fed cites skittish employers who brought on temporary and part time workers and increased overtime instead of hiring more full time workers december 2007 to june 2009 the great recession the worst downturn since the great depression lasted 18 months and grew out of the risky mortgages banks provided to marginal borrowers when home prices fell homeowners couldn t refinance their loans leading to millions of foreclosures and pushing the nation s largest banks to the brink of failure lending dried up consumer spending tumbled and businesses laid off 8 7 million workers economic output fell by nearly 4 and the unemployment rate doubled to 10 by october 2009 job growth resumed in february 2010 but increased modestly for several years economic growth generally has been lackluster averaging 2 3 a year for years consumers and businesses spent cautiously and banks tightened lending standards though activity has picked up the past few years when claim social security benefits this social security mistake could result in a lifetime of regret study says the next recession unlike the past three recessions no widespread financial bubbles are likely to spark the next downturn and in contrast to 1990 and 2001 don t blame the fed after raising interest rates in 2018 the fed has cut rates three times this year to a historically low range of 1 5 to 1 75 amid low inflation and recession worries next time the culprits will almost certainly be jittery businesses deritis and swonk say president donald trump s trade war with china and a sluggish global economy have spawned uncertainty that has dampened business investment and clobbered manufacturing economists forecast growth of less than 2 in the current quarter and next year despite a tentative phase 1 u s trade deal with china larger conflicts with beijing remain unresolved and trump could eventually impose tariffs on 160 billion in chinese made consumer products that were planned for mid december but suspended because of the tentative agreement swonk says it likely would take such a shock to frighten companies into reining in hiring that has added a healthy 180 000 jobs a month this year that would dent consumer spending which makes up 70 of economic activity and has held up well amid solid job and wage growth and it could result in a recession scott anderson chief economist of bank of the west says it wouldn t necessarily take an escalation of the trade fight to tip the u s into a descent a 15 plunge in the record high stock market could spook households already on edge i think we re slouching toward recession he says if there is one deritis and swonk predict a relatively brief six month episode shorter than the past three and the 11 month average since world war ii deritis expects a 1 2 drop in economic output below the average 2 decline over the past 70 years he also sees the unemployment rate rising by 1 6 percentage points in line with a typical downturn about 600 000 jobs likely would be lost he says well below the millions that vanished during the past few recessions that doesn t mean there won t be pain less educated and other vulnerable workers are the most likely to be laid off the moody s paper says a big reason the next tailspin is likely to be mild is the chill cast by the great recession besides tighter credit standards banks maintain deep capital cushions as a result of post crisis regulations allowing them to continue lending to creditworthy customers and after peaking during the last downturn household debt as a share of gross domestic product has fallen to the lowest level since the early 2000s consumers will have greater resources available to manage their existing debts and increase their spending to support the economy deritis wrote in the report as prices for land equipment and labor fall enterprising businesses will likely scoop them up reigniting growth he says there are minefields that could extend the downturn corporate debt is at a record high with the biggest risks centered on companies with low credit ratings a recession could intensify if those firms default and start laying off workers swonk says perhaps more worrisome is that the upswing is likely to be uninspiring policymakers don t have the tools to generate a more robust recovery swonk says the fed which has cut interest rates an average of about five percentage points in previous recoveries won t have that luxury with its key short term rate at 1 5 to 1 75 though it almost certainly will resume bond purchases to lower long term rates and after trump took the unusual step of spearheading tax cuts and spending increases during the expansion helping push the national debt to 22 trillion congress may have less appetite for a big stimulus to dig out of a slump the economists say also global growth probably won t ramp up anytime soon deritis says continuing to squeeze american manufacturers that rely on exports it ll be a jobless recovery swonk says
prof w d lakshman following is the full text of the speech made by new central bank governor deshamanya prof w d lakshman at the monetary policy review press conference held last friday he is the 15th governor of the central bank a privilege an honour to have been appointed to the esteemed and celebrated position of great consequence coming as the 15th in the wake of a long succession of great men who decorated this position over the last 69 years this succession of governors started indeed from john exeter the author of the monetary law act of 1949 the enabling legislation of the central bank and sri lanka s pioneer central bank head the central bank was established replacing its predecessor the currency board system in the 1950s with the objective of adding to the country s regained sovereignty the independent decision making authority in monetary and financial affairs it is now an institution carrying a great deal of prestige respect and credibility having managed the monetary affairs of sri lanka with responsibility for six decades i am committed to sustain and add to this institutional greatness i hope to do my best to uphold the great traditions of the central bank built up over nearly seven decades i must make particular reference to my immediate predecessor dr indrajit coomaraswamy who has contributed a great deal to re establish the central bank s respect within our socioeconomic system in general and the country s financial community in particular his contribution to firmly establish procedures and practices in the central bank governance is acknowledged to be extremely helpful and facilitating for his immediate successor let me express my thanks and gratitude to the president prime minister and secretary to president for selecting and appointing me to this highly responsible and exalted position as expected of me i will make every effort to safeguard its reputation and prestige and to fulfil the confidence placed on me by appointing authorities my work experience has so far been academic studied and taught central banking as part of courses in economics and development studies both at undergraduate and graduate levels i am therefore familiar with central banking theory and practice as academic disciplines i am also familiar with the historical debates covering the role of central banking and how different schools of thought viewed that role this is however the first time i am trying my hand as a practical central banker i very much look forward to learn from my colleagues within the central bank while working and hope will also be able to in the process make my own contribution to sri lankan central banking the central bank s large pool of competent committed and highly trained human resources i am sure will provide me the required support in carrying out the functions of my office as the head of the apex financial authority in the country the objectives of the central bank as specified in the mla in 1949 1 the stabilisation of domestic monetary values maintenance of price stability 2 the preservation of the par value or the stability of the exchange rate of the sri lankan rupee maintenance of exchange rate stability 3 the promotion and maintenance of a high level of production employment and real income in sri lanka 4 the encouragement and promotion of the full development of the productive resources of sri lanka however in keeping with i the worldwide trends in central banking and ii the rapid changes in international financial markets the central bank embarked on a modernisation programme in 2000 the objectives were adjusted accordingly bringing them down to two core objectives reflecting the abandonment of the real economy objectives 3 and 4 in the mla of 1949 1 maintaining of economic and price stability 2 maintaining of financial system stability these statutory objectives show that the central bank has an important stabilisation role as well as a facilitation role in the economy the country has been struggling with below 5 percent growth for several years and growth has now slowed down to below 3 percent although inflation has been contained from the demand side weather related food price volatility and dependence on imported commodities constantly threaten cost of living statistics on unemployment appear acceptable but they hide issues such as underemployment low labour force participation high unemployment amongst educated youth an ageing labour force and low productivity and these need to be addressed if the government is to realise its goal of eliminating poverty through effective utilisation of labour resources in the external sector sluggish export performance large trade deficits persistent current account deficits dependence on debt inflows in the absence of alternative levels of fdi inflows as well as high foreign financing needs are major concerns in addition we need to be watchful of developments in the global economy and financial markets as well in this context we hope to engage with the imf and other multilateral agencies while remaining within the framework of national policy to ensure that the country reverts to a sustainable path of reserve accumulation a prerequisite for exchange rate stability as well the government is aware of the need for fiscal consolidation and in addressing long standing issues in the fiscal sector while supporting the revival of the economy in the monetary sector we have seen credit flows coming to virtually a standstill monetary and regulatory measures taken so far as well as the measures that are being contemplated by the government including the moratorium on capital repayments of bank loans by smes supported by improving business confidence will result in an acceleration of credit flows in the period ahead this will also help address the increased npl ratios of the financial sector with the revival of economic activity we expect economic growth to accelerate to around 4 4 5 percent and inflation to remain below 4 percent in 2020 beyond 2020 with the necessary reforms annual growth is expected to accelerate to over 6 5 percent while inflation will be managed between 4 6 percent in the present context of subdued growth and development continuing prevalence of poverty pockets despite poverty alleviation policies of over several decades in the past and prevalence of unemployment and underemployment at worrying levels the fiscal and monetary authorities and decision makers in different real sectors of the economy are confronted with the challenge of searching and identifying alternative policy sets of greater efficacy than the neo liberal policy set i hope to be able to make my contribution in this search for alternatives together with the other authorities the monetary policy announcements made today we hope will be of positive impact helping and supporting the various measures announced from time to time by fiscal and other authorities it is in this overall context that the monetary board decided to maintain its accommodative policy stance unchanged at yesterday s meeting we hope to be proactive and the central bank will assess the developments in the market and the economy closely and take appropriate action as necessary to maintain economic and price stability as well as financial system stability which is our mandated objective within the overall policy framework of the government this is a time of important changes in sri lankan development policy and practice questions are being raised extensively about the validity and relevance of washington consensus type or neoliberal type policies to achieve the desired goals of inclusive sustainable and shared development this questioning may also apply to central banking nowadays i am extremely excited about the opportunity i have gained at a time like this to make my active contribution to sri lanka s search for an alternative policy approach to achieve the desired development objectives let me also recognise the important role of mass media in educating the public and improving economic and financial literacy media has performed the vital role of questioning the governments and the central bank s actions in the economy and the financial market and we hope media will continue to play the role of a balanced intermediary between the government and the public which will help us achieve the ultimate goal of improved social welfare through appropriate policy measures thank you very much
during his tenure at the leading universities in the island he has taught thousands of students and they are now serving the country as well as holding prestigious posts overseas president gotabaya rajapaksa has made another excellent decision by appointing deshamanya prof w d lakshman as the 15th governor of central bank of sri lanka he assumed duties in his new post on 24 december prof lakshman is a well known scholar prolific writer a fearless economist and an excellent administrator moreover he is a dedicated person with a clear vision for the country during his long academic

understanding of how state market and civil society interact with each other he belongs to the precious few who adorn the history with their distinct contributions in the fields of economics and political economy with all the endowments i am sure he will enlighten the governor position and be able to take the central bank to the next stage of excellence prof lakshman obtained his bachelor s degree in economics from the university of ceylon at peradeniya where he had the honour of belonging to the pioneer sinhala medium batch of students he concluded his undergraduate studies in 1964 with

successfully defended his thesis titled terms of trade public policy and economic development of ceylon 1948 1958 and gained a dphil in economics from the university of oxford and returned to teach at his alma mater which became university of peradeniya uop in 1978 it was after working there for 17 years that he left the uop in 1981 to join the uoc as the professor of economics the pinnacle of professor lakshman s academic career was the appointment as vice chancellor of the uoc on retirement he was awarded the professor emeritus status and was later honoured by the uoc with an honorary

at the leading universities in the island he has taught thousands of students and they are now serving the country as well as holding prestigious posts overseas one of the most important contributions by prof lakshman to the country was setting the trend by starting postgraduate programs in the uoc beginning with the postgraduate diploma in economic development ded in 1985 and followed by the masters in economics the central bank has already shown its capability in managing single digit inflation since february 2009 given this situation keeping inflation in the 4 6 range may be a feasible target however achieving 6 5 economic growth and maintaining a single digit rate of interest and a stable exchange rate over the medium term is quite challenging i wrote my first postgraduate thesis under his abled supervision and became one of the early beneficiaries of postgraduate education commenced by him the postgraduate programs in economics in uoc since around 1987 were supported by the institute of social studies iss in the netherlands under a dutch grant for development of economics education in sri lanka many young graduates in economics recruited to serve the department of economics in uoc were trained at doctoral level under this uoc iss project in economics they are now leading the department of economics and contributing to policy dialogues in different fields of economics and development providing ample justification for the work prof lakshman played in training the next generation of economists apart from his academic and administrative skills it is noteworthy how he used his excellent personal relationship skills to gain support from students administrative staff academics and non academic staff to run the university smoothly he transformed the places and individuals when and where it is most needed through his unconventional thinking i understand that during his tenure as vice chancellor there was no students unrest a rare situation in our university system he has left behind a significant legacy in terms of institutional development in terms of the career guidance and staff training units he set up at the uoc in his tenure as vice chancellor he has held many positions nationally and internationally many positions at uoc including vice chancellor ceo vice chancellor of sanasa university chairman of the institute of policy studies ips a member of the national economic council during the first half of the 2000s and later during 2007 9 senior advisor of the ministry of finance and planning 2008 10 chairman of the

studies the hague in the netherlands in ryukoku university kyoto japan and in saga university saga japan we at the international university of japan niigata japan were lucky to have many inspiring lectures by him on many occasions prof lakshman has shown his prowess in research and writing as well his professional writing both in sinhala and english is impressive his books monographs articles span widely differing areas of economics among his numerous publications the following are some books edited and published a dilemmas of development fifty years of economic change in sri lanka sri lanka published by the association of economists colombo 1997 b sri lanka s development since independence socio economic perspectives and analyses new york nova science publishers inc 2000 c distant neighbours fifty years of japan sri lanka relations colombo faculty of graduate studies university of colombo 2003 it was during my high school time that i came to know prof lakshman through his arthika vislashanaya an excellent textbook available to high school economics students at that time i became a fan of him at the time while setting myself a target of learning economics and then becoming a university professor i entered the university of colombo in 1981 and he joined the department of economics in the same year which was such a lucky coincidence in my life enabling many of us to study economics under his abled guidance professors sirimal abeyratne amala de silva athula ranasinghe dr harsha athurupane and i were among his earliest groups of students in colombo they all joined the department except me and harsha later joined the world bank prof lakshman was an icon and a dedicated teacher and his lectures were always so absorbing and inspiring i am sure they will all sincerely join me in wishing him good luck in his new endeavours the new troika and challenges for the new governor i want to review and post some challenges for the new governor according to the national policy framework npf the policy document of the new government macroeconomic target for 2020 2025 are to achieve an economic growth at 6 5 or higher to exceed per capita income of 6 500 to maintain the rate of unemployment at less than 4 to maintain the rate of annual inflation below 5 to keep budget deficit at less than 4 of gdp to maintain stable exchange rate and maintain a single digit rate of interest the central bank has already shown its capability in managing single digit inflation since february 2009 given this situation keeping inflation in the 4 6 range may be a feasible target however achieving 6 5 economic growth and maintaining a single digit rate of interest and a stable exchange rate over the medium term is quite challenging all those targets are possible to achieve if the ministry of finance responsible for fiscal policy and the central bank responsible for monetary policy can effectively coordinate with the political authority of the country this requires a new troika consisting of the new governor of the cbsl secretary to ministry of finance and the secretary to the president of the country if this new troika can engage in a productive dialogue the government can realise the targets of npf here it is worth mentioning the original troika consisting basil rajapaksa at that time senior advisor to the former president mahinda rajapaksa former defence secretary gotabaya rajapaksa and lalith weeratunga who was the secretary to then president mahinda rajapaksa they were managing in the last phase of the separatist war with indian troika which consists of then national security advisor m k narayanan then foreign secretary shankar menon and then defence secretary vijay singh it is quite a known fact that the original troika could work effectively because of the unique nature of the dialogue i came to know excellent chemistry of original troika when i met current president gotabaya rajapaksa and weeratunga in a meeting on economic policy dialogue a way forward for sri lanka organised by the pathfinder foundation sometime in july 2017 let s hope the new troika will have the courage to engage in a friendly and professional conversation and bring the country forward the writer is a professor in economics international university of japan niigata japan and the president of the association of sri lankan

as we approach the end of 2019 it is always a good idea to look back at the year evaluate the performance of our economy but at the same time consider what lies ahead in the new year what are the prospects opportunities as well as risks for 2020 the year that just passed has been a continuation of the trend that we have experienced the last few years high level of growth in real gdp decreasing unemployment budget and primary surplus for the general government and a gradual reduction in the level of npls for the banking sector at the same time the level of public debt is back on its downward trajectory after a year 2018 of a sudden increase due to the one time investment by the government in the co op bank however will this trend continue for the next year what are the risks that could derail us from this path the expectation is that this positive trend will continue for 2020 still high levels of growth albeit smaller than previous years decreasing unemployment that will get close to levels of full employment continuation of the high level of primary surplus decreasing levels of public and private debt and further reduction in the level of npls in the banking sector through mainly sale of problematic loans to third parties one has to take into account the risks and how those could affect performance and deviate the outcome from the above expectations an easy way to approach this is by distinguishing between internal and external sources internal sources of risk one source of internal risk is the pending decision by the supreme court regarding pay cuts of civil servants during the crisis period this is certainly a serious issue not only because of the magnitude of the amount in question but also the effect that this can have on other groups of employees that were also negatively affected in terms of pay cuts during the crisis years in general i would argue that there is a growing trend for excessive demands from union officials as if we have forgotten completely what happened to our economy a few years ago this is true whether it has to do with employees of the general government semi governmental organisations such as cyta or eac teachers in primary and secondary education or bank employees another potential source of risk is the implementation of the national health system gesy during the summer we are moving towards full implementation of the system and many obstacles still need to be overcome such as the autonomy of state hospitals a pre requisite for a well functioning gesy how that will affect the public finances remains to be seen the problems that still affect our banking sector and how those will play out during 2020 is another potential risk still high levels of npls compared to other eu countries low level of profitability high level of operational costs low interest rate margin excessive liquidity that is too expensive for the banks to handle due to the negative interest rates imposed by the ecb inability to provide enough loans to the market increasing competition from non bank institutions a potential slowdown of the construction industry that has been fueling the growth of the economy in the last few years this risk has to do also with the recent changes in the investment programme or golden passport scheme the stricter conditions imposed by the government which were necessary and should have been imposed a long time ago might potentially lower interest in the programme which will have a negative impact on the construction sector external sources of risk the biggest threat right now for global markets has to be geopolitical risks the trade war between the us and china has been going on for almost two years and in the process around 750 bln of goods have been exposed to tariffs and other protectionist measures other major partners of the us have also been affected by this shift in us policy europe canada mexico japan since the election of president trump and his promise of america first protectionist measures are affecting world trade and subsequently the growth of the global economy cyprus an open economy cannot remain untouched by these developments the never ending brexit story and how it will eventually play out is causing unrest in financial markets and the real economy the win of boris johnson in the recent election brought signs of relief that brexit will be done soon with a deal however his later efforts for the implementation period to end in december 2020 with no extension if needed caused further worries and negative outlook for the uk european and global economy cyprus is and will be affected by brexit for many reasons given the close ties with the british economy the low to negative interest rate environment that we have been experiencing in recent times is another cause of concern for the global markets and disrupts financial markets this looks like the norm now and is expected to continue for some time at least until inflation picks up and reaches acceptable standards central banks are stuck in a way since they have used all possible monetary tools this is the reason that they are urging now for more fiscal expansion as a way to promote growth despite the need to lower the level of public debt in many countries the effects of this interest rate environment are evident in cyprus as well through the banking sector lastly one cannot ignore the tensions that exist with turkey and their unlawful interference in cyprus exclusive economic zone eez this creates an obstacle to any form of foreign investment as it adds to the country risk it can also affect negatively cyprus tourism a pillar of the economy i attempted above to provide an assessment of what we should expect for next year but also highlight some of the risks that we need to consider whether internal or external this list is by no means exhaustive but it includes what i would consider the most important sources that we need to evaluate and manage source

guest columnist by sam amadi three issues will define africa s future in the 2020s the first is political stability african countries especially those in the sahel and sub sahara must reestablish state capacity and legitimacy amid the chaos of 21st century jihadist attacks and communal conflicts these countries are terribly weak and incoherent strength and coherence are required for effective modern state the market with weak state capacity will not deliver prosperity and order to africa strong and legitimate states effectively creating and managing markets is what africa needs the second challenge africa must address is political justice the legacy of the berlin conference is unraveling everywhere in africa suppressed or oppressed ethnic groups and communities are resurrecting grievances and playing the politics of difference africa s multiethnic and multireligious states are wobbling under the gale of identity politics and struggle for access to resources the weakness of the political bargains that ushered the post colonial state in africa is showing too glaring and the problem is that there is no presence of mind and even epistemic resources to deal with the crisis of the political state in the context of the overwhelming predicament of the economic state in africa the politic of identity is blowing harshly across africa state fragility amid extreme poverty is a difficult proposition to deal with africa social scientists and jurists must innovate new structures of social justice to deal with the challenge the third challenge for africa in the next decade will be how to trigger and sustain transformative economic growth sustained and inclusive economic growth in africa will enhance the capacity to solve the two other challenges africa is the only other continent besides the middle east that has not recorded real sustained economic growth africa s development deficit is caused largely by lack of good infrastructure electricity supply in african countries except for south africa and one or two other countries is totally comatose for example nigeria the largest economy in africa has average available capacity of about 6 000 megawatts of grid electricity it distributes to homes and businesses on the average less than 4 000mws daily apart from the north africa the rest of africa has an average of 50 access to electricity of course south africa is an outlier in these indicators acute power shortage undermines industrial development and makes african enterprises uncompetitive transportation infrastructure is similarly very bad bad road and rail networks have weakened market transactions in urban and rural areas hindered intra african trade and undermined the growth of african economies the lack of growth in physical and social infrastructure is both the main cause and outcome of economic underdevelopment in africa it has resulted in shared poverty communal violence and political instability in african countries more lamentable in a country like nigeria that has tremendous potential for development and transformation the african continent is not poor but poorly governed one indicator of poor governance is the failure to build and sustain critical infrastructure the good news is that african leaders have realized this failure and are making serious efforts to build the missing critical infrastructure the major policy thrust of the nigerian government s economic policy is infrastructural development it budgets to spend about three trillion naira on infrastructure the nigerian budget as an example contains many road and power projects that the government hopes will re inflate the economy and create more wealth and jobs liberalisation has become a major feature of the emerging economic landscape in nigeria as well as in other african countries since 1999 with the return to civilian democratic government the nigerian government has focused on liberalising the economy and allowing the private sector to play more role in provision of economic goods and services this policy has culminated in the privatization of major state owned enterprises the most recent and ambitious is the divestment of government shares in electricity generation and distribution companies in 2013 this process transferred 17 electricity companies to private enterprises and brought the government owned transmission company into private sector management the power sector privatization rode at the back of privatization of government owned tourism and telecommunication companies the privatisation of the refineries is touted as next on the card interestingly africa s largest grid south africa and egypt and morocco are still publicly owned many african governments have decided on liberalisation and commercialisation as the model of economic growth liberalisation and commercialisation came at the behest of neoliberalism that swept africa and other developing economies as a result of balance of trade deficit and debt overhang although the assumptions of neoliberalism are being questioned in the mainstream washington institutions that promoted the ideology and the ideology is now in retreat in the advanced economies many african countries are inevitably on the neo liberal agenda and will continue to rely on private funds to finance infrastructure this will be the case because these countries are witnessing dramatic fall in commodity prices and huge infrastructure deficit is overwhelming dwindling public finance a fundamental challenge of establishing and managing infrastructure in africa would be how to raise the required finance for massive infrastructural development african governments will resort to the private sector to finance new infrastructure and manage old ones under different forms of private public partnership the african private sector is underdeveloped this means that there will be increasing resort to foreign direct and portfolio investments these come with anxieties about costs pricing and policy and political stability how can the continent attract enough private capital to finance infrastructural leap forward required to restart economic prosperity in africa private enterprises will be reluctant to finance infrastructure projects unless there is a regulatory regime that inspires confidence and assures predictable returns on investment furthermore private investment in infrastructure would mean cost recovery pricing of infrastructural services which in some sense are public goods this has socio political difficulties that require a matured and effective regulatory framework so the most pressing challenge for these government would be to develop capacity for effective infrastructure regulation the regulatory challenge for infrastructural development is threefold first we must get the economics right economics is not everything but economics matters the regulatory framework should give assurance of cost recovery and reasonable profit in social context that maximises access to quality services it is easy to talk of a pricing framework that recovers costs in a fair and sustainable manner but it is difficult to establish and manage such a framework the risks profiles are high in the continent and no amount of contract will be complete in the sense of anticipating contingencies and covering them incomplete contracting means that certainty and fairness in regulatory governance will be key pricing will be a major concern obviously infrastructure markets will need a guarantee of cost reflective pricing but market fundamentalism gets it wrong proper pricing is not only a science it s a science as well as an art it should skillfully adapt universal principles of infrastructural pricing to unique local contexts the emphasis is more on unique rather than local a sustainable public policy framework for infrastructure development must be built within an accountable and inclusive politics for sustainability this will be difficulty when the macro politics in african countries are patently illiberal and unaccountable public participation and support are critical to a sustained delivery of infrastructure reform policy building such public support will determine success this is one area world bank type reformers will need a better script in implementing reform good politics will determine failure or success and good politics as the late political economist claude ake counselled should not approximate the coordinates of a free market but rather rooted in community engagement and accountability technology is a driver of infrastructure innovation a desirable regulatory framework will continuously adapt to technological changes and incentivise both investment and deployment of new and smarter technologies it has been generally believed in the past based on the austrian school of economic orthodoxy arising largely from the writings of frederick hayek and joseph schumpeter that public enterprises should be privatized because they are not inclined to innovation associated with entrepreneurial leadership but modern insight in corporate governance has debunked this claim mariana mazzucato has argued persuasively in her book the entrepreneurial state debunking public vs private sector myths 2015 that the state has the capacity to shape innovative activities of the private sector so even with a large private sector african governments can leverage on ict and technology diffusion in the continent to stimulate innovation for infrastructure development but getting the economic politics technology regulatory matrix right requires deep contextual thinking embedded in multidisciplinary scholarship the political economy of infrastructure regulation in nigeria and other african countries is different from europe and america because those countries are concerned mostly with efficiency while african countries are more concerned with capacity increase the economics of infrastructure regulation must not just improve efficiency but should quickly lead to capacity expansion we must get our socio economic theories right to succeed in growing capacity within the right efficiency framework we cannot stick to the neoliberal insights about government failures otherwise we run the danger of privatising and liberalizing without expanding infrastructure network market efficiency narrowly defined will not serve africa s broader strategic interests african consumers are poor access to infrastructure services take a huge chunk of their income the cost of infrastructure service is high because of institutionalised efficiency private operators will ask for cost recovery prices the implication is high tariff we have seen this double whammy in electricity prices after privatisation in nigeria with unstable supply and high costs consumer complaint and civil society restiveness will grow this will unsettle regulatory stability and politicise decision making infrastructure development in africa will be hindered unless the economics politics technology regulatory matrix can guarantee civic consensus in the long term and assure quick wins for all the stakeholders particularly the consumers the regulatory policy for infrastructure must address the challenge of sustainable supply within the context of accessibility and acceptability this means that effective policy communication and political engagement are critical to a sustainable infrastructure management strategy in africa technology especially digital technology is changing industrial production and the business model for delivery of public and private goods digital technology will help diffuse best practices and narrow the infrastructure divide smart apps and software will change grid functionality and remodel the entire business landscape of infrastructure clean energy interconnectivity and efficient transportation networks will depend on whether we can easily plug and play with the rest of the world smart policies will enable the design development deployment and management of new technologies for clean energies and efficient transportation but technological innovation needs good policy backup as usual africa is seduced by the smartness of the so called digital revolution and has embraced clean energy start ups as evidence of energy security but it has not built the technology policy backbone for infrastructure development such policy backbone requires a meshing of academia and the public sector in the pursuit of best policy nigeria and south africa are the leading economies in sub saharan africa south africa is ahead in terms of physical infrastructure but it still struggles because of a lack of dynamic eco system for infrastructure innovation apart from a few african countries the rest of continent is left behind and ravaged by economic stagnation and social atrophy violent conflicts destroy leftovers of rudimentary infrastructure and further deplete social and leadership capitals that should be directed towards infrastructural development the conflict trap leads to the poverty trap which further reinforces underdevelopment good infrastructure social and physical will play a critical role in the rebuilding of african society in the decade of the 2020s financing and sustaining infrastructure development will be major challenges for african economies african economies will continue to resort to private especially foreign investible capital the problem is that funds will not be available in the proportion and tenor needed african economies cannot raise the required financing for infrastructure through taxation and other internal mobilization because of the obvious absence of capacity the challenge is not helped by lack of capacity in economic policymaking political leadership and technological innovation these endogenous factors are compounded by the threat of jihadist war and violent communal conflicts that weaken the legitimacy and effectiveness of african countries overcoming these challenges will require at the minimum production of socially relevant knowledge for effective policymaking the collapse of african universities and the illiteracy of political leadership in africa damage the prospects of intelligent policy management the major focus as africans enter the 2020s will be the development of epistemic institutions that can synergize knowledge production policymaking and project delivery at a scale that can transform african economies and reverse the curse of pervasive state failure that should be the major challenge of the next decade dr amadi former chairman of nerc coordinates programme on infrastructure regulation in africa pira in abujae

the odds of the u s slipping into a recession in 2020 are getting longer the probability of a downturn has fallen to about 1 in 3 following a tentative trade war truce with china and a resilient job market but that doesn t mean there won t be one here s the good news economists believe a recession that starts next year would probably be relatively short and mild more like the slumps of the early 1990s and early 2000s than the devastating collapse that led to nearly 9 million job losses during the great recession of 2007 09 that s largely because consumer finances are in good shape and there s little sign of the excesses like runaway inflation or housing or stock market bubbles that triggered previous slides the balance sheets of households businesses and banks remain strong says cristian deritis deputy chief economist at moody s analytics we have the capacity to absorb a recession restructure and see growth recover learn more best personal loans think of the 10½ year old economic expansion as a slow but steady jogger who gradually stumbles to a halt in the latter stages of a marathon but can quickly resume the race after a brief rest by contrast the mid 2000s economy that ended with the great recession was a sprinter who burned out and crashed dairy farmers milk new opportunities struggling dairy farmers building a future with hazelnuts specialty milk and creative thinking here s the rub the recovery from a recession that begins late next year is likely to be tepid as well partly held back by some of the same forces that cause the downturn it ll be a mild recession with a mild recovery says diane swonk chief economist of grant thornton a report by deritis shows the 11 recessions since world war ii can be grouped into three categories from 1948 to 1968 the u s experienced classic boom and bust downturns consumer and business spending surged prices soared and producers responded by making too much stuff leading to a shakeout and lower prices that revived demand the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s were marked by oil price shocks that dampened consumer spending and downturns since the early 1990s largely have been set off by financial bubbles or run ups that eventually burst for some perspective on where a 2020 downturn might fit here s a look at the past three recessions in the financial bubble era july 1990 to march 1991 the eight month long downturn was at least partly sparked by savings and loans institutions that ratcheted up lending for risky commercial real estate projects that went bust resulting in the failure of a third of the s ls and discouraging housing and other loans other factors included a leap in oil prices after the u s invasion of kuwait and earlier federal reserve interest rate hikes to fight inflation economic output declined by about 1 2 and the unemployment rate rose from 5 2 to 6 8 as 1 4 million jobs were lost but even after the recession ended employers continued to cut jobs or hire sparingly pushing unemployment to 7 8 by june 1992 and creating the first jobless recovery march 2001 to november 2001 the eight month slump was triggered by the collapse of the dot com stock bubble which led to a pullback in business investment also contributing fed rate hikes to fight inflation in 2000 the september 11 terrorist attacks and the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s economic output actually increased slightly during this mild recession but the unemployment rate rose from 4 2 to 5 5 as 1 4 million jobs were shed after the downturn officially ended unemployment continued to climb to 6 3 by june 2003 and nearly 1 million more jobs were lost in another jobless recovery economists have partly blamed the jobless rebounds of the early 1990s and early 2000s on financial meltdowns that chilled lending and investment a study by the kansas city fed cites skittish employers who brought on temporary and part time workers and increased overtime instead of hiring more full time workers december 2007 to june 2009 the great recession the worst downturn since the great depression lasted 18 months and grew out of the risky mortgages banks provided to marginal borrowers when home prices fell homeowners couldn t refinance their loans leading to millions of foreclosures and pushing the nation s largest banks to the brink of failure lending dried up consumer spending tumbled and businesses laid off 8 7 million workers economic output fell by nearly 4 and the unemployment rate doubled to 10 by october 2009 job growth resumed in february 2010 but increased modestly for several years economic growth generally has been lackluster averaging 2 3 a year for years consumers and businesses spent cautiously and banks tightened lending standards though activity has picked up the past few years when claim social security benefits this social security mistake could result in a lifetime of regret study says the next recession unlike the past three recessions no widespread financial bubbles are likely to spark the next downturn and in contrast to 1990 and 2001 don t blame the fed after raising interest rates in 2018 the fed has cut rates three times this year to a historically low range of 1 5 to 1 75 amid low inflation and recession worries next time the culprits will almost certainly be jittery businesses deritis and swonk say president donald trump s trade war with china and a sluggish global economy have spawned uncertainty that has dampened business investment and clobbered manufacturing economists forecast growth of less than 2 in the current quarter and next year despite a tentative phase 1 u s trade deal with china larger conflicts with beijing remain unresolved and trump could eventually impose tariffs on 160 billion in chinese made consumer products that were planned for mid december but suspended because of the tentative agreement swonk says it likely would take such a shock to frighten companies into reining in hiring that has added a healthy 180 000 jobs a month this year that would dent consumer spending which makes up 70 of economic activity and has held up well amid solid job and wage growth and it could result in a recession scott anderson chief economist of bank of the west says it wouldn t necessarily take an escalation of the trade fight to tip the u s into a descent a 15 plunge in the record high stock market could spook households already on edge i think we re slouching toward recession he says if there is one deritis and swonk predict a relatively brief six month episode shorter than the past three and the 11 month average since world war ii deritis expects a 1 2 drop in economic output below the average 2 decline over the past 70 years he also sees the unemployment rate rising by 1 6 percentage points in line with a typical downturn about 600 000 jobs likely would be lost he says well below the millions that vanished during the past few recessions that doesn t mean there won t be pain less educated and other vulnerable workers are the most likely to be laid off the moody s paper says a big reason the next tailspin is likely to be mild is the chill cast by the great recession besides tighter credit standards banks maintain deep capital cushions as a result of post crisis regulations allowing them to continue lending to creditworthy customers and after peaking during the last downturn household debt as a share of gross domestic product has fallen to the lowest level since the early 2000s consumers will have greater resources available to manage their existing debts and increase their spending to support the economy deritis wrote in the report as prices for land equipment and labor fall enterprising businesses will likely scoop them up reigniting growth he says there are minefields that could extend the downturn corporate debt is at a record high with the biggest risks centered on companies with low credit ratings a recession could intensify if those firms default and start laying off workers swonk says perhaps more worrisome is that the upswing is likely to be uninspiring policymakers don t have the tools to generate a more robust recovery swonk says the fed which has cut interest rates an average of about five percentage points in previous recoveries won t have that luxury with its key short term rate at 1 5 to 1 75 though it almost certainly will resume bond purchases to lower long term rates and after trump took the unusual step of spearheading tax cuts and spending increases during the expansion helping push the national debt to 22 trillion congress may have less appetite for a big stimulus to dig out of a slump the economists say also global growth probably won t ramp up anytime soon deritis says continuing to squeeze american manufacturers that rely on exports it ll be a jobless recovery swonk says
opinion three issues will define africa s future in the 2020s the first is political stability african countries especially those in the sahel and sub sahara must reestablish state capacity and legitimacy amid the chaos of 21st century jihadist attacks and communal conflicts these countries are terribly weak and incoherent strength and coherence are required for effective modern state the market with weak state capacity will not deliver prosperity and order to africa strong and legitimate states effectively creating and managing markets is what africa needs the second challenge africa must address is political justice the legacy of the berlin conference is unraveling everywhere in africa suppressed or oppressed ethnic groups and communities are resurrecting grievances and playing the politics of difference africa s multiethnic and multireligious states are wobbling under the gale of identity politics and struggle for access to resources the weakness of the political bargains that ushered the post colonial state in africa is showing too glaring

president gotabaya rajapaksa has made another excellent decision by appointing deshamanya professor w d lakshman as 15th governor of central bank of sri lanka he assumed duties in his new post on tuesday december 24 2019 professor lakshman is a well known scholar prolific writer a fearless economist and an excellent administrator moreover he is a dedicated person with a clear vision for the country during his long academic career spanning over five decades he has mentored many of the active economists that this country has produced i happen to be one such lucky student during his time at the university of colombo uoc he is a deep unconventional thinker holds the utmost standards in his professional life and liked by many in the policy circle he is also a rare political economist in the country with a deep understanding of how state market and civil society interact with each other he belongs to the precious few who adorn the history with their distinct contributions in the fields of economics and political economy with all the endowments i am sure he will enlighten the governor position and be able to take the central bank to the next stage of excellence professor lakshman obtained his bachelor s degree in economics from the university of ceylon at peradeniya where he had the honour of belonging to the pioneer sinhala medium batch of students he concluded his undergraduate studies in 1964 with second class upper division honours he commenced his academic career at his alma mater when soon after his graduation he was invited to join the academic staff of the department of economics he successfully defended his thesis titled terms of trade public policy and economic development of ceylon 1948 1958 and gained a dphil in economics from the university of oxford and returned to teach at his alma mater which became university of peradeniya uop in 1978 it was after working there for seventeen years that he left the uop in 1981 to join the uoc as the professor of economics the pinnacle of professor lakshman s academic career was the appointment as vice chancellor of the uoc on retirement he was awarded the professor emeritus status and was later honoured by the uoc with an honorary doctor of letters d litt in 2008 in 2005 the president of sri lanka decorated him with the deshamanya national honours for his distinguished contribution to the country s education postgraduate programmes during his tenure at the leading universities in the island he has taught thousands of students and they are now serving the country as well as holding prestigious posts overseas one of the most important contributions by professor lakshman to the country was setting the trend by starting postgraduate programmes in the uoc beginning with the postgraduate diploma in economic development ded in 1985 and followed by the masters in economics i wrote my first post graduate thesis under his able supervision and became one of the early beneficiaries of postgraduate education commenced by him the postgraduate programmes in economics in uoc since around 1987 were supported by the institute of social studies iss in the netherlands under a dutch grant for development of economics education in sri lanka many young graduates in economics recruited to serve the department of economics in uoc were trained at doctoral level under this uoc iss project in economics they are now leading the department of economics and contributing to policy dialogues in different fields of economics and development providing ample justification for the work professor lakshman played in training the next generation of economists apart from his academic and administrative skills it is noteworthy how he used his excellent personal relationship skills to gain support from students administrative staff academics and non academic staff to run the university smoothly he transformed the places and individuals when and where it is most needed through his unconventional thinking i understand that during his tenure as vice chancellor there was no students unrest a rare situation in our university system he has left behind a significant legacy in terms of institutional development in terms of the career guidance and staff training units he set up at the uoc in his tenure as vice chancellor he has held many positions nationally and internationally many positions at uoc including vice chancellor ceo vice chancellor sanasa university chairman institute of policy studies ips a member of the national economic council during the first half of the 2000s and later during 2007 9 senior advisor ministry of finance and planning 2008 10 chairman presidential commission on taxation 2009 10 president colombo plan council 2009 at different times in his academic career he held visiting professorial positions in the institute of social studies the hague in the netherlands in ryukoku university kyoto japan and in saga university saga japan we at the international university of japan niigata japan were lucky to have many inspiring lectures by him on many occasions professor lakshman has shown his prowess in research and writing as well his professional writing both in sinhala and english is impressive his books monographs articles span widely differing areas of economics among his numerous publications the following are some books edited and published a dilemmas of development fifty years of economic change in sri lanka sri lanka published by the association of economists colombo 1997 b sri lanka s development since independence socio economic perspectives and analyses new york nova science publishers inc 2000 c distant neighbours fifty years of japan sri lanka relations colombo faculty of graduate studies university of colombo 2003 it was during my high school time i came to know professor lakshman through his arthika vislashanaya an excellent textbook available to high school economics students at that time i became a fan of him at the time while setting myself a target of learning economics and then becoming a university professor i entered the university of colombo in 1981 and he joined the department of economics in the same year which was such a lucky coincidence in my life enabling many of us to study economics under his able guidance professors sirimal abeyratne amala de silva athula ranasinghe dr harsha athurupane and i were among his earliest groups of students in colombo they all joined the department except me and harsha later joined the world bank professor lakshman was an icon and a dedicated teacher and his lectures were always so absorbing and inspiring i am sure they will all sincerely join me in wishing him good luck in his new endeavours challenges for the new governor i want to review and post some challenges for the new governor according to the national policy framework npf the policy document of the new government macroeconomic target for 2020 2025 are to achieve an economic growth at 6 5 per cent or higher to exceed per capita income of usd 6500 to maintain the rate of unemployment at less than 4 percent to maintain the rate of annual inflation below 5 per cent to keep budget deficit at less than 4 per cent of gdp to maintain stable exchange rate and maintain a single digit rate of interest the central bank has already shown its capability in managing single digit inflation since february 2009 given this situation keeping inflation in the 4 6 per cent range may be a feasible target however achieving 6 5 per cent economic growth and maintaining a single digit rate of interest and a stable exchange rate over the medium term is quite challenging all those targets are possible to achieve if the ministry of finance responsible for fiscal policy and the central bank responsible for monetary policy can effectively coordinate with the political authority of the country the writer is a professor in economics international

this article is more than 4 years old tldr all told americans cross subsidize health care for unauthorized immigrants to the tune of 17 0 billion a year federal taxpayers provided 10 0 billion in subsidized care to unauthorized immigrants in 2019 the total amounts to 1 615 per unauthorized immigrant imposing a burden of 51 per u s resident current federal policy is to prohibit federal tax funding of health care to unauthorized immigrants through either medicaid or obamacare two years ago i did a deep dive showing that despite these statutory prohibitions americans nevertheless provided at least 18 5 billion in subsidized health services for unauthorized immigrants in 2016 today i want to explore whether that reality has appreciably changed under the trump administration nevertheless rough estimates suggest that the nation s 4 1 million uninsured immigrants who are unauthorized likely receive about 4 1 billion in health services paid for by federal taxes 2 4 billion in health services financed by state and local taxpayers another 2 6 bankrolled through cost shifting i e higher payments by insured patients to cover hospital uncompensated care losses and roughly 1 3 billion in physician charity care in addition to these amounts unauthorized immigrants likely benefit from at least 0 9 billion in implicit federal subsidies due to the tax exemption for nonprofit hospitals and another 5 5 billion in tax expenditures from the employer tax exclusion all told americans cross subsidize health care for unauthorized immigrants to the tune of 17 0 billion a year of this total federal taxpayers provided 10 0 billion in subsidized care to unauthorized immigrants in 2019 produced by christopher j conover duke university using methods and sources described in post in this post i describe in more detail current policy current sources of funding for health care of unauthorized immigrants in a previous post i offered four independent reasons federal tax funding for such care is a bad idea that is a reader need only accept one not all in order to conclude we should dispense with such funding current policy regarding federal funding of health care for unauthorized immigrants the purported intent of federal policy is to prevent federal tax dollars from being used to fund health care for unauthorized immigrants except in extreme circumstances notwithstanding express prohibitions contained in the statutes related to medicaid and obamacare there also are companion federal programs that permit federal funding to be used for health care of unauthorized immigrants indirectly while the trump administration has taken various steps to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants there have been no overt changes in policy regarding use of federal funds to finance health care for such individuals thus what follows is largely unchanged from my post from two years ago where use of federal dollars to fund health care for unauthorized immigrants is expressly prohibited medicaid under medicaid and chip children s health insurance program no federal funding may be used to cover unauthorized immigrants except for payment for limited emergency services specifically medicaid payments for emergency services may be made on behalf of individuals who are otherwise eligible for medicaid but for their immigration status these payments cover costs for emergency care for lawfully present immigrants who remain ineligible for medicaid as well as undocumented immigrants moreever states can and do use state only medicaid programs to cover such individuals for example california s health for all kids act provides unauthorized immigrant children with access to coverage through medi cal the state medicaid program its passage in 2015 made california the largest state to use state only funding to provide coverage to all children regardless of immigration status in doing so it joins new york illinois massachusetts washington and the district of columbia aca under the aca immigrants must be lawfully present to purchase insurance in a qualified health plan or to be eligible for an advance payment for premium tax credit or cost sharing reduction under legislation signed by governor jerry brown in june 2016 california would have been the first state to allow unauthorized immigrants to purchase health plans through its insurance exchange without fear that their information would be shared with other government agencies the law directed california s exchange covered california to apply for a state innovation waiver to allow people who would be eligible for the exchange if not for their immigration status to purchase california qualified health plans qhps which provide benefits identical to those included in other aca compliant qhps this policy requires a waiver because it involves an alteration to the original terms of the aca which bars the participation of unauthorized immigrants in state exchanges however this waiver request was withdrawn on january 18 2017 where use of federal dollars to fund health care for unauthorized immigrants is indirectly permitted the clear intent of restrictions embedded in medicaid and obamacare is undercut by several end arounds that allow health care for unauthorized immigrants to be indirectly funded using federal dollars medicaid dsh payments first there is a source of medicaid financing that indirectly benefits unauthorized immigrants dsh payments kaiser family foundation reports dsh or disproportionate share hospitals are hospitals that serve a large number of medicaid and low income uninsured patients at the facility level medicaid dsh payments are limited to 100 percent of the costs incurred for serving medicaid and uninsured patients that have not been compensated by medicaid medicaid shortfall the dsh program simply provides a general subsidy against a hospital s aggregate uncompensated care losses from uninsured patients nothing requires hospitals to back out their spending on uncompensated care for unauthorized immigrants from their aggregate losses consequently federal medicaid funds end up indirectly subsidizing their care even though it would be expressly illegal to pay for their care by making them direct medicaid recipients medicare dsh payments in a similar fashion although the formula is much more complicated medicare also pays hospitals a dsh payment that effectively serves as a general subsidy to offset aggregate uncompensated care losses without making any distinction between uncompensated costs generated by unauthorized immigrants and those generated by american citizens or legal immigrants community health centers federally qualified health centers provide primary healthcare dental mental health and pharmacy services they treat all comers without concern for immigration status or ability to pay for care tax exemption nonprofit hospitals and other health facilities receive tens of billions of dollars annually in benefits from the federal tax exemption including forgone taxes public charitable contributions and the value of tax exempt bond financing unauthorized immigrants benefit from this federal largesse employer tax exclusion the employer tax exclusion provides an indirect federal tax subsidy to everyone with employer sponsored health insurance noncitizen immigrants are admittedly less likely to have such coverage than natives but the differential is less than 10 percentage points after adjusting for the most important demographic socioeconomic characteristics from where i sit a libertarian leaning conservative health reformer current policy makes a lot of sense it allows states or localities to opt to provide health care for unauthorized immigrants using local tax resources in a country of 330 million people with deeply divided views on this issue the federalist approach seems far preferable to trying to adopt a one size fits all policy that forces tens of millions of federal taxpayers to subsidize lawbreakers against their will moreover my view is that if the intent of federal policy is to prevent taxpayer resources from being used to finance health care for unauthorized immigrants federal officials have an obligation to be vigilant this does not occur inadvertently and a parallel obligation to be transparent if it does that was the purpose of my writing an earlier post on this issue 20 months ago current funding for health care of illegal immigrants uninsured unauthorized immigrants according to pew research center there were 10 5 million unauthorized immigrants in the u s in 2017 this is the latest figure available and smaller than the 11 3 million figure i used to develop my 2016 estimate of spending on health care for unauthorized immigrants currently 14 9 of the non elderly uninsured 4 1 million are unauthorized immigrants who are ineligible for both medicaid and aca coverage under federal law for purposes of discussion i am going to focus principally on financing health care for unauthorized immigrants who are uninsured since we know that about 70 of care for america s uninsured is uncompensated meaning that ultimately it is paid for by society in one way or another in 2013 the latest available such figures america s uninsured generated 84 9 billion in uncompensated care costs or 1 257 per person who was ever uninsured that year of this 39 was covered by various federal programs e g disproportionate share payments to hospitals was covered by various federal programs e g disproportionate share payments to hospitals 23 by state and local governments e g via taxpayer support of state and locally owned hospitals by state and local governments e g via taxpayer support of state and locally owned hospitals 12 came in the form of physician charity care covered came in the form of physician charity care covered 25 was covered by hospitals arguably by cost shifting i e higher charges to privately insured patients that effectively cross subsidize care for patients who do not pay full freight etc an unknown fraction of this stems from emtala the emergency treatment and active labor act a federal law that requires hospitals to treat emergency patients regardless of their ability to pay emtala is an example of taxation by regulation insofar as the same outcome might have been achieved by using tax dollars to pay hospitals to treat such patients voluntarily between 2013 and 2018 the average daily uninsured rate declined by 35 dropping from 14 4 to 9 4 according to the national health interview survey one might suppose that uncompensated care levels would decline in direct proportion however according to the american hospital association hospital uncompensated care declined only 18 between 2013 and 2017 even though the average daily uninsured rate declined by 37 during the same period in the shorthand of economists the elasticity of uncompensated care spending with respect to uninsured risk is 5 for every 10 change in uninsured risk there is only a 5 reduction in uncompensated care spending using this elasticity estimate to the observed change in uninsured risk from 2013 to 2018 i have estimated there was a 16 9 reduction in uncompensated care spending between 2013 and 2019 assuming this reduction was the same across each of the four components and that unauthorized immigrants received a pro rata share of such support i e 14 9 they account for the 10 5 billion in uncompensated care costs in 2019 financed as follows 4 1 billion federal taxpayers federal taxpayers 2 4 billion state and local taxpayers state and local taxpayers 2 6 billion hospital charity care bad debts arguably cost shifted to private patients hospital charity care bad debts arguably cost shifted to private patients 1 3 billion physician charity care i recognize these back of the envelope figures are crude but they are the best estimates i could make given that the recent 2017 national academy of sciences report the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration only provides highly aggregated estimates of cost impacts with no breakdown of how much of these costs can be attributed to health care etc federal taxpayers it might puzzle some readers that the federal government is paying for any care for unauthorized immigrants in light of federal policy this can happen through fraud to be sure but as explained earlier most of this occurs indirectly through various federal programs that fund institutions rather than individuals these include hospitals medicaid medicare dsh payments and community health centers free clinics hospital charity care bad debts hospitals with 501 c 3 status are required to establish written financial assistance policies under affordable care act sections 501 r as a consequence there is a cleaner distinction between genuine charity care and bad debts than there was in the past when hospitals adopted very disparate practices about how to treat situations where a patient was not expected to pay charity care versus not able to pay bad debt let me concede that there is only limited evidence that hospitals engage in what s called dynamic cost shifting that is if a hospital s uncompensated care burden rises by 1 million only some not all of that amount can be expected to be recovered by the hospital s increasing charges to privately insured patients to make up the difference that said hospitals can and do exercise market power meaning they are able to charge private patients a higher rate than medicare or medicaid patients this practice results in profits from private patients that then are used by the hospital in various ways including the provision of charitable care the point being that if the federal government eliminated whatever payments it now makes for uncompensated care including that generated by unauthorized immigrants hospitals hypothetically would not respond by increasing charges to recover part of their increased uncompensated care costs but instead make adjustments in the form of either spending less on other things or taking steps to discourage unauthorized immigrants from showing up at their doors conversely if federal state or local governments were to make hospitals entirely whole regarding their uncompensated care losses to unauthorized immigrants this would not necessarily benefit hospital patients in the form of lower charges for these reasons it is not altogether obvious that these hospital uncompensated care losses are a problem that can be solved by better public policy nevertheless they manifestly are a public policy issue from the standpoint of patients concerned about high health costs physician charity care the 1 3 billion in physician charity care represent an average of 1 414 for each of the country s 893 000 active physicians according to medscape s physician compensation report for 2017 the average physician makes 294 000 a year even generously assuming a 60 hour workweek that s roughly 100 hourly meaning the average physician devotes 14 1 hours a year to charity care for unauthorized immigrants less if we assume a higher hourly rate note that physicians receive no tax benefits for providing charity care that is they cannot write off the cost of charity care from their personal or business taxes consequently although physician charity care is an important component of the uncompensated care landscape in my view these voluntary donations of time a longstanding worthy tradition in american medicine do not pose a public policy concern other federal subsidies benefiting unauthorized immigrants although it presumably did not arise by a deliberate intent to benefit unauthorized immigrants current tax policy likely confers an additional 6 4 billion in additional benefits financed by u s taxpayers the tax exemption for nonprofit hospitals and any other nonprofit health facilities benefits unauthorized immigrants regardless of their insurance status the employer tax exclusion benefits unauthorized immigrants who happen to receive employer provided health benefits tax exemption the value of the nonprofit tax exemption to u s nonprofit hospitals in 2019 was approximately 28 7 billion including forgone taxes public charitable contributions and the value of tax exempt bond financing assuming that 10 5 million unauthorized immigrants receive a pro rata share of this benefit they receive roughly 0 9 billion in additional federal subsidies for their hospital care i could locate no parallel figures for other nonprofit health facilities employer tax exclusion estimating the size of these tax benefits for unauthorized immigrants is of necessity extremely rough i could locate no reliable information on the wage distribution of such immigrants especially among those who obtain employer provided health benefits according to kaiser family foundation nonelderly lawfully present and unauthorized immigrants are as likely as nonelderly citizens are to live in a family with at least one full time worker but they are more likely than citizens are to be low income since they often work in low wage jobs more concretely nearly half 48 of unauthorized immigrants live in low income families below 200 of the federal poverty level that said as shown earlier we know that only 4 1 million of 10 5 million unauthorized immigrants are uninsured leaving 6 4 million with some sort of coverage no good data exist on what fraction of these obtain non group health coverage but kaiser family foundation s larry levitt has said via twitter that some are buying non group but i d agree that it s primarily employer coverage assuming that 91 have employer provided coverage which is the identical percentage among all non elderly adults having private coverage in 2018 this would equal 5 8 million unauthorized immigrants with such coverage and even if we conservatively assume that such workers obtain less expensive coverage from an employer with many low wage workers the single premium in 2019 would be 6 189 compared to 7 188 across all plans industries if we further conservatively assume all unauthorized workers pay no income taxes and are only liable for payroll taxes the tax subsidy amounts to 15 3 947 per worker or 5 5 billion for all unauthorized immigrants with such coverage conclusion when we sum all the figures including 10 5 billion for the uninsured and another 6 5 billion in tax subsidies we arrive at a grand total of 17 0 billion in subsidized health care for all unauthorized immigrants in 2019 these figures are much easier to grasp on a per capita basis this amounts to a benefit of 1 615 per unauthorized immigrant it imposes a burden of 51 per u s resident the share that concerns me the most 10 0 billion borne by federal taxpayers amounts to 951 per unauthorized immigrant or 30 per u s resident admittedly one could argue that since the amounts at stake are so small this is not an issue worth fighting about however it is precisely that sort of thinking that has led us to today s dismal reality that unfunded liabilities facing uncle sam now are roughly 200 trillion and rising so even though the dollar stakes are quite small in a federal budget that now spending at a rate of 4 8 trillion a year i believe citizens and federal policymakers should stop pressing the easy button and seriously ponder four important principled arguments against federal tax financing of health care for unauthorized immigrants federal funding is unnecessary federal funding is inefficient federal funding is unconstitutional federal funding is immoral i elaborate on these arguments in a previous post why federal taxpayers should not fund health care for unauthorized immigrants ___________________________________________________________ read chris book the american health economy illustrated aei press 2012 available at amazon and other major retailers

something odd is happening with brexit it looks like prime minister boris johnson is pushing for a hard brexit much to my surprise johnson s strong showing in the recent election which secured the tories its biggest majority since the days of margaret thatcher should have set the stage for the great brexit bait and switch this has been my argument for months since johnson became the front runner to replace theresa may all johnson had to do was manipulate events to get a majority which marginalizes the hard brexiteers of the european research group erg then he could undermine brexit by giving back all the concessions during his subsequent negotiations with the eu over a trade deal this analysis should have been the correct one given the staunch opposition by the political elite in the u k to brexit but something has changed against the left a ro rockwell jr llewellyn h best price 2 84 buy new 8 00 as of 08 22 utc details johnson is practically channeling nigel farage in his stance to trade negotiations with the european union the modified withdrawal bill that passed parliament with six labour defectors significantly strengthens johnson s hand in trade negotiations by removing any potential extension beyond the end of 2020 there are a ton of changes the guardian article linked above covers the two year transition period eu chief negotiator michel barnier was planning on using to bully johnson around with is dead january 31st brexit happens and if no trade deal happens between then and the end of 2020 the u k leaves on wto terms and the so called hard brexit happens hard brexit is back on the table and parliament has been sidelined while this isn t news anymore what it means is given the context of the his negotiations with french president emmanuel macron in october which secured the current withdrawal treaty i think the way forward is clearer now the macron gambit the key to understanding what s happening is the ever shifting dynamic between france germany and the u k in relation to their relationship with the united states macron is pushing france to unseat germany as the de facto rule setter for the eu he wants more integration at every level but most importantly fiscally macron understands that the euro is flawed because of a lack of fiscal integration for the euro to survive at least three major things need to happen there needs to be a single entity capable of issuing and retiring euro zone sovereign debt the ecb and the eu fiscal authorities need to have a relationship similar to that of the federal reserve and the u s treasury dept the euro has to weaken considerably to remove the garrote around the necks of countries like spain portugal italy greece and even france much of the existing sovereign debt needs to be converted into a eurobond doing away with much of the stock of debt as liabilities for member states like italy and spain the ecb can lead the way with its 3 trillion it s holding on its balance sheet in my podcast with yra harris from a few weeks ago yra made the point that the ecb has an enormous pile of gold it can use to back its new eurobonds to sell this plan to skeptical markets so all the pieces are in place but opposition to brexit was actually undermining it macron realized that the brits would never accept betraying brexit the way it had been planned he saw the opportunity to cut the gordian knot of brexit and screw germany at the same time germany is dead set against any of these things occurring it wants to continue with using the euro to underwrite its mercantilism to leverage its industrial prowess it has benefited handsomely at the hollowing out of member states economies through internal trade advantages and then once they were broke used debt restructuring as a bludgeon to buy up their assets at pennies on the euro c f greece italy was to be next on the block this is fundamentally why the euro is designed the way it currently is it wasn t a mistake rather it was the plan i know that sentiment will rankle my german readers but that s my take on the history they may have had their reasons for this but this is classic colonialism but what does this have to do with brexit the double cross everything macron installed christine lagarde as head of the ecb to push for fiscal integration and to politically blackmail the germans into going along with it how by threatening to write down or allowing default on the massive 850 billion in target 2 liabilities german banks have in euro zone sovereign debt on their balance sheets but there s no way city of london and the crown would survive the british people s anger at underwriting the costs of this shakedown and subsequent debt crisis nigel farage and the other hard brexiteers understood that this was a key issue but one that didn t resonate with voters fishing rights and immigration get people to the polls not bailing out german banks but make no mistake farage the old commodities trader knows that breaking the british banking system free from the eu s and put up a hard border as it were between them is the key to a successful brexit and i suspect after it was clear they couldn t convince the british people otherwise that city of london and the crown saw this as well so macron and johnson looked at the landscape clearly and with the blessing of the british political class negotiated a settlement by allowing johnson and the u k to get clear of the fiscal and political storm macron gets even more leverage over germany whose economy is the one hurt most by a hard brexit the germans run a huge trade surplus with the u k cutting that down weakens the euro and germany at the same time germany will insist on bail ins of depositors versus bailing out the italian government but macron realizes the only way for the eu to survive the coming debt crisis is to over ride germany s deflationary attitudes they are going to have to print euros like no tomorrow he may throw merkel a bone in the negotiations but it won t be much she lost the power struggle over the new european commission macron is many things but he s not stupid he knows the euroskeptic populists will eventually rise to power in italy spain portugal and potentially even germany he knows he s in trouble in france the miserable polling data is a reflection of the economic misery of german austerity taken too far the only way to placate them and keep them in the euro zone and ultimately the eu is to give them debt relief and a bigger seat at the monetary policy table matteo salvini understands this viktor orban understands this the special relationship so the deal is pretty simple in the end the collapse of project fear to dissuade the british people against brexit forced a reconsideration on the ruling elite who finally felt a real threat to their power because if they betrayed brexit one of either farage or jeremy corbyn could have entered 10 downing st giving real voice to political change in the u k i m sure prince andrew s relationship with jeffrey epstein didn t help matters one whit amazon com gift card i buy new 10 00 as of 08 25 utc details this forced macron and johnson to make a deal which gave johnson just enough room to win the election and blame the remainers this ends the stalling and macron can use brexit to his advantage within the eu to get what he wants no one gets everything they want here but this is the best of a bad situation for everyone the u k is realigning itself politically with the u s under trump trump will beat his impeachment unless pelosi is setting up for an even bigger one as martin armstrong suggests he ll likely win re election in november unless something profound changes british neoconservatives which johnson represent want to continue fighting against a resurgent russia macron and merkel want rapprochement brexit in the end may be more about the return of the special relationship between the u s and the u k while europe splits itself off as an independent beast but with the euro being systemically destroyed by the ecb s poisonous negative interest rates i still don t see a path forward even if macron gets what he wants reprinted with permission from gold goats n guns the best of tom luongo
the u s economy supported by robust consumer spending and a strong job market has maintained a moderate pace of growth as 2019 draws to a close while worries about an immediate recession have abated its economy still shows signs of slowing down with business investment falling and manufacturing sector contracting the u s economic recovery has hit a lot of bumps over the past few months it faces a thorny path ahead amid lingering trade uncertainty and a synchronized global slowdown mixed picture u s economic growth in the third quarter expanded at an annual rate of 2 1 percent which is slightly up from the 2 percent in the second quarter and marks a sharp deceleration from the 3 1 percent in the first quarter according to data from the u s commerce department a panel of professional forecasters recently surveyed by the national association for business economics nabe anticipated the u s gross domestic product growth would slow from 2 9 percent in 2018 to 2 3 percent this year after the central bank s latest policy meeting earlier this month u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell described the mixed picture in his words household spending has been strong supported by a healthy job market rising incomes and solid consumer confidence in contrast business investment and exports remain weak and manufacturing output has declined over the past year personal consumption expenditures which account for roughly 70 percent of u s economic output have seen robust growth during the first three quarters rising by 1 1 percent 4 6 percent and 3 2 percent respectively partly soothing fears over the health of the world s largest economy the unemployment rate which has remained below 4 percent since the beginning of the year dropped slightly to 3 5 percent in november again hitting the lowest in nearly five decades job gains have averaged 205 000 from september to november despite resilient consumer spending and a strong labor market business investment has declined for two straight quarters dropping by 1 percent in the second quarter and 2 3 percent in the third acting as a drag on the overall economy economic activity in the manufacturing sector meanwhile contracted for a fourth consecutive month in november according to the institute for supply management the purchasing managers index registered 47 8 percent in september the lowest in a decade trade uncertainty the fed chairman along with many economists has repeatedly cited trade tensions as one of the factors that have been weighing on the u s economy noting that the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade uncertainty over the past year powell said the central bank adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and provide some insurance against the associated risks the fed has lowered interest rates three times since july amid growing uncertainty stemming from trade tensions weakness in global growth and muted inflation pressures these policy adjustments put the current federal funds rate target range at 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent the business roundtable an association of ceos for some of the largest companies in the united states recently said its index of the ceos economic outlook in the fourth quarter dropped to 76 7 which remains below the historical average and marks the seventh consecutive quarterly decline ceos are justified in their caution about the state of the u s economy while we have achieved a competitive tax environment uncertainty surrounding trade policy and slowing global growth are creating headwinds for business said joshua bolten president and ceo of the business roundtable according to the nabe survey released earlier this month trade policy continues to be the most widely cited dominant downside risk to the u s economy through 2020 with half of respondents citing it as the greatest downside risk u s initiated trade tensions have taken a toll on the global economy the world trade organization recently said that world merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1 2 percent in 2019 substantially slower than the 2 6 percent growth forecast in april in its latest world economic outlook report released in october the international monetary fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 percent warning that growth continues to be weakened by rising trade barriers and growing geopolitical tensions thorny road ahead the u s economy is expected to further slow down next year against the backdrop of persistent trade policy uncertainty and a labor market that could be losing momentum as well as a precarious global outlook official data showed that job gains have averaged 180 000 per month so far in 2019 compared with an average monthly gain of 223 000 in 2018 indicating that the overall level of hiring has been slowing down over the past few months meanwhile the pace of payroll growth has remained weak according to the cnbc global cfo council survey for the fourth quarter 60 percent of chief financial officers expect their company s head count to decrease over the next 12 months the nabe survey panelists believed the u s economy would slow to 1 8 percent in 2020 the consensus forecast calls for a pickup in housing but slower growth in business investment and consumer spending along with larger deficits in trade and the federal budget said nabe president constance hunter chief economist at kpmg the federal budget deficit which ballooned rapidly during the trump administration has drawn concern from many powell the fed chairman recently stressed the urgency for the u s congress to address the issue noting that there would otherwise be less fiscal space to support the economy in a downturn on the trade front uncertainty has been the only certainty despite progress with canada mexico and china the united states has proposed tariffs on french products in retaliation for digital service tax and its boeing airbus aircraft subsidy dispute with the european union has been escalating the administration s trade policies have left little room to maneuver diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton a major accounting firm wrote in an analysis either the president backs off his campaign promises holds the line on tariffs and the economy slows or he risks a recession by doubling down on trade wars and heightening uncertainty swonk wrote source xinhua

customs modernization and compliance e commerce and the digital and new economy american shipper recently sat down with zhaokang to discuss china s continued efforts to modernize its trade policies and customs practices and procedures american shipper china was working on trade and customs modernization before it joined the wto about 20 years ago when was the last time that a comprehensive rewrite of the china customs laws took place how long did that process take and in your view was it successfully implemented throughout china customs zhaokang the last comprehensive china customs law revision started in 1998 when intensive major trade negotiations with the u s and europe presented challenges and opportunities for china s institutional reform and modernization and was passed by the congress of china on july 8 2000 it then took effect on jan 1 2001 it took about another three years to revise and draft the administrative regulations and rules when drafting the new customs law a task force reviewed the customs and supply chain process customs laws and regulations of other countries and proposed new programs such as customs rulings surety advance clearance and self compliance there have been some minor changes to china s customs laws since then which took place in 2013 2016 2017 and 2018 based on continued observance of best practices in the u s eu and other countries china customs has also made significant changes related to regulations information technology infrastructure and organizational and procedural improvements the china customs law of 2000 has basically been well implemented nationwide but new questions other than conventional customs valuation and classification technical issues and challenges such as cross border e commerce fair competition product safety environmental protection and rules of origin have arisen during the past 20 years china customs is an enlarged organization encompassing 43 districts six national centers of excellence for revenue management and compliance risk management 450 ports of entry and a staff of about 70 000 to implement new regulations and procedures customs headquarters in beijing will monitor reports from the districts conduct field studies and receive input and proposals from the trade community and other government agencies china customs officers conduct a cargo exam american shipper what changes in trade as well as regulatory implementation did china s customs laws not foresee when first implemented did the laws anticipate the possibility of trade disruptions such as bilateral free trade agreements and tariff fights that we re seeing today what about the increase in e commerce exports as well as container exports in general from china zhaokang undoubtedly there have been significant changes in the past 20 years for china s trade and business environment trade volume in 1999 was about 360 billion and reached 4 62 trillion in 2018 and is expected to reach 5 trillion in 2019 the country s e commerce grew from almost zero to 1 3 trillion of which 200 billion was cross border china implemented an e commerce law on jan 1 2019 which generally requires the government to treat different business models fairly and equally as well as protect consumers china has signed and implemented free trade agreements with asean australia singapore pakistan new zealand chile peru costa rica iceland switzerland maldives georgia hong kong macao and holds ongoing negotiations with the gcc gulf cooperation council japan and korea sri lanka israel norway mauritius moldova panama and palestine the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep agreement is expected to be signed early next year while bilateral trade agreements were considered as early as 2000 other significant trade disruptions were not expected this has resulted in new challenges for china customs including rules of origin regulation and enforcement balance between trade compliance and facilitation and intellectual property rights protections and consumer product safety china is also reviewing and revising its export control legislation american shipper describe the most significant regulatory and policy changes that china customs has undertaken since the country joined the wto zhaokang in the past 20 years especially before and after the wto trade facilitation agreement was accepted in september 2015 china has made great efforts to further modernize its trade and customs environment for trade efficiency and compliance enforcement after its adoption of a customs ruling program in 2002 china customs implemented new regulations regarding customs online monitoring and control for processing trade in 2006 in 2012 the agency implemented its first rules for cross border e commerce retailing but the pilot implementation was limited to certain ports and mainly certain large e commerce platforms in 2014 china customs implemented the enterprise classification and authorized economic operator programs for customs and trade compliance facilitation and security the agency working with other governmental partners implemented free trade zone pilot programs for periodic entry of customs clearances introduced a paperless customs entry process emphasized informed compliance with the trade and strengthened its enforcement of intellectual property rights in 2017 china customs announced its customs clearance integration and comprehensive reform to promote nationwide centralized customs clearance and procedures establishing six national centers for revenue administration and risk management with the international trade single window project it has further advanced customs automation and trade facilitation by integrating more government agencies such as the ministry of commerce the state administration for quarantine inspection and quality the state taxation administration and the administration for foreign exchange into the e port customs and trade automation platform in 2018 china customs absorbed the commodity inspection and quarantine administration into its operation american shipper how important is it for china customs to continue upgrading its laws and regulations how fast can this be done especially with the rapid pace of change in trade in your view is china customs committed to upgrading its laws and regulations zhaokang the leadership of the central government and customs administration have a sincere commitment to further modernization of trade and the customs laws and regulations however china must shift its international trade from a gross growth model to a quality growth model with rule of law to reduce trade disputes and ultimately reduce transactional costs and best service the people we must especially recognize that fair competition intellectual property rights protection and product safety are critical for establishing a trusted business environment for the consumers all these cannot be accomplished by customs alone in october 2019 the chinese central government announced its nationwide cross agency regulations on improving the business climate in my view the crucial elements to further trade and customs modernization in china include a comprehensive review of the trade supply chain with an emphasis on centralized simplified and transparent processes and procedures for both the trade and customs officials to follow this should also include integrated port and border management and reorganization where necessary to remove hurdles from legitimate trade and remove loopholes for violations we would like to see china customs promote national pilot programs that effectively apply the latest information technology and data science such as gs1 blockchain and ai to prevent fraud and promote efficiency and compliance intelligence driven risk management and targeting is most effective china customs must continue to engage in bilateral and multilateral cooperation to share information and knowledge with other customs agencies and build customs trade partnerships aimed at capacity building and compliance and facilitation of cross border trade american shipper china customs this year introduced the customs further reform framework 2020 which considers the role and operation of the agency through the remainder of the 21st century how important is it for china customs to commit to this type of future framework zhaokang with the 21st century framework initiated by wco the trade community expects that the china trade and customs environment be based on the following values of rule of law in trade transparency due process fairness justice imparity predictability consistency uniformity and efficiency which demands the government improve the customs and trade legal system this must be accomplished through detailed customs law regulations implementation of rules and orders ruling decisions and providing compliance guidance the new campaign and process for revising the national customs law and regulations fitting for the next generation of commerce demands a deep dive review and may take two to three years at the least while uniformity consistency and transparency of customs laws and regulations have been improved over the past decades there are still issues with different processes that result in unfair treatment and compliance concerns for businesses operating in different customs districts some pilot programs such as for cross border e commerce and free trade zones that operate without limitations may create significant discrimination and inconsistency for companies timely evaluation process must be conducted on all programs to ensure cost effectiveness and fair competition i would like to reiterate that china and the whole world should have a rules based international trade and customs environment for the sake of openness efficiency compliance fair competition consumer protection and sustainable growth image by 文 邵 from

african development as 1960 dawned sub saharan africa braced for historic change that year 17 of its countries were destined to gain independence from european colonial powers but six decades on the continent is mired in many problems it is struggling to build an economic model that encourages enduring growth addresses poverty and provides a future for its youth here are some of the key issues youth explosion africa s population grew from 227 million in 1960 to more than one billion in 2018 more than 60 are aged under 25 according to the brookings institution a us think tank the most striking change for me is the increasing reality of disaffected youth a younger population that is ready to explode at any moment cameroonian sociologist francis nyamnjoh told afp they are hungry for political freedoms they are hungry for economic opportunities and they are hungry for social fulfilment joblessness is a major peril unemployed youths are an easy prey for armed groups particularly jihadist movements in the sahel or may be tempted to risk clandestine emigration often at the cost of their lives the continent s population is expected to double by 2050 led by nigeria ethiopia and democratic republic of congo drc poverty and inequality the proportion of africa s population living below the poverty line less than 1 90 1 7 euros per day fell from 54 7 in 1990 to 41 4 in 2015 according to the world bank but this average masks enormous differences from one country to another exemplified by gabon 3 4 of the population in 2017 and madagascar 77 6 in 2012 the inequalities between countries are as extreme as in asia and the inequalities within countries as as high as in latin america where landless peasants coexist with huge landowners said togolese economist kako nubukpo christophe cottet an economist at the french development agency afd pointed out that inequality in africa is very poorly measured there are notably no figures on inequalities of inherited wealth a key issue in africa mega cities and countryside recent decades have seen the expansion of megacities like lagos and kinshasa typically ringed by shantytowns where people live in extreme poverty although many medium sized cities have also grown more than 40 of africans now live in urban areas compared with 14 6 in 1960 according to the world bank in 1960 cairo and johannesburg were the only african cities with more than a million residents consultants mckinsey and company estimate that by 2030 about 100 cities will have a million inhabitants twice as many as in latin america but this urban growth is not necessarily the outcome of a rural exodus said cottet the population is rising across africa as a whole rather faster in towns than in rural areas said cottet there is also the problem of unemployment in towns rural people have little interest in migrating there lost decades of growth growth in africa slammed to a halt in the early 1980s braked by a debt crisis and structural adjustment policies it took two decades to recover per capita gdp as measured in constant us dollars shows the up and downs although these figures are official and do not cover africa s large informal economy 1 112 in 1960 1 531 in 1974 1 166 in 1994 and 1 657 in 2018 if you do an assessment for over 60 years something serious happened in africa with the loss of 20 years but there is no denying that what is happening now is more positive cottet said the imf s and world bank s structural adjustment programmes broke the motors of growth said nubukpo whose book l urgence africaine the african emergency makes the case for a revamped growth model the belt tightening programmes emphasised the short term to the detriment of investments in education health and training new thinking needed africa has a low rate of industrialisation is heavily dependent on agriculture and its service sector has only recently started to emerge we have not escaped the colonial model basically africa remains a producer and exporter of raw materials said nubukpo he gave the example of cotton 97 of africa s cotton fibre is exported without processing the phase which adds value to raw materials and provides jobs for jean joseph boillot a researcher attached to the french institute for international and strategic affairs africa is still seeking an economic model of development there is very little development of local industries he said this can only be achieved through a very strong approach of continental industrial protection but this is undermined by the great powers in order to pursue free trade the chinese the indians and westerners want to be able to go on distributing their products governance problem lack of democracy transparency and efficient judicial systems are major brakes on african growth and wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few said the experts of the 40 states deemed last year to be the most world s most corrupt countries 20 are in sub saharan africa according to transparency international africa is not developing because it is caught in the trap of private wealth and the top wealth holders are african leaders said nubukpo we must promote democracy free and transparent elections to have legitimate leaders who have the public interest at heart which we absolutely do not have nyamnjoh also pointed to marginalised groups there should be more room for inclusivity of voices including voices of the young voices of women

africa has the world s lowest electrification rate its power consumption per capita is just 613 kilowatt hours per year compared to 6 500 kwh in europe and 13 000 in the united states observed african development bank afdb president akinwumi adesina in july 2017 that s 9 4 of eu and 4 7 of us electricity consumption it s equivalent to americans having electricity only 1 hour a day 8 hours a week 411 hours per year at totally unpredictable times for a few minutes hours or days at a stretch it s actually even worse than that excluding significantly electrified south africa sub sahara africans consume an almost irrelevant 181 kwh of electricity per capita 1 4 of the average american s in sub saharan africa over 600 million people have no electricity and over 700 million rely on wood grass and dung for cooking and heating the region is home to 16 of the world s population and 53 of those without electricity by 2050 its urban populations could increase by 600 million determined to transform the dark continent the afdb launched a 12 billion new deal on energy in 2017 and a light up and power africa initiative in july 2018 it frequently emphasized that access to sufficient supplies of reliable affordable modern energy including fossil fuels is critical for the continent s social and economic development without energy it is impossible to create jobs increase productivity reduce inequality improve people s health and wellbeing or end poverty the bank s lofty goal for its energy new deal is 100 access to electricity in urban areas and 95 in rural areas by 2025 in july 2017 mr adesina told the african union summit he was excited that japan has answered our call to adopt a balanced energy mix that includes its ultra supercritical clean coal technologies that remove sulfur nitrogen oxides and particulates while greatly reducing co2 emissions in 2018 the bank approved seed money for a nigerian coal project and geared up to finance a 350mw coal plant in senegal it also initiated plans for a 2 billion coal fired power station in kenya s port city of lamu after the imf world bank and other western lenders rebuffed kenya but then mr adesina and the afdb caved into carbon colonialist pressure the bank now says almost nothing about coal or even natural gas its new themes include responding to global concerns about climate change gradually adopting a low carbon and sustainable growth path significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning to green growth and clean renewable energy in september 2019 the bank announced that it planned to begin scrapping coal fired power plants all across africa build the largest solar zone in the world and pull funding for the lamu power plant we re getting out of coal mr adesina said coal is the past and renewable energy is the future so the afdb has joined the world bank goldman sachs and other multilateral anti development banks in caring more about climate alarmism and avoiding criticism from the likes of greta the perpetually aggrieved and angry grinch of christmas 2019 than they do about safeguarding the lives livelihoods health and living standards of hundreds of millions of electricity deprived africans this 180 degree flip flop is delusional dysfunctional and disingenuous for many it will be lethal first there is nothing green clean or renewable about wind and solar energy the vast amounts of land and raw materials mines and factories required to build wind turbines solar panels batteries and transmission lines to harness widely dispersed insufficient intermittent weather dependent wind and solar energy to benefit sub saharan africans are anything but clean green renewable or sustainable in fact trying to meet those needs would require millions of turbines and billions of solar panels second the afdb cannot possibly achieve its energy new deal or light up and power africa goals with wind and solar it will never reach 100 or even 25 access to meaningful electricity that way no country has ever built or sustained a modern economy this way and countries that have tried to by mandating wind solar and fossil fuel free economies are paying a terrible price headlines tell the story germany s green suicide industrial job losses top 80 000 the german wind industry faces extinction 340 000 german families have pricey electricity cut off british steel faces insolvency british families are already deeply in debt to their energy suppliers before winter even sets in meanwhile the fossil and nuclear based us economy added another 266 000 jobs in november and wages also grew third there is no evidence to support claims that temperatures droughts and weather anywhere in africa are unprecedented or due to carbon dioxide from fossil fuels or from wood grass and dung fires they and other climate changes have been common throughout history and an energy rich prosperous africa will be far better able to deal with future changes than a poor energy deprived continent could fourth china india indonesia and other countries are not going to stop building coal and gas fired power plants and emitting enormously more co2 why should africa and the afdb go down a different path finally banishing fossil fuels and nuclear and focusing on pseudo renewable energy will mean millions of children and parents will continue to suffer and die needlessly every year from diseases of poverty and energy deprivation this eco manslaughter at the hands of climate activists and banks must not continue africans have a fundamental human right to more than the few light bulbs cell phone charging stations and one cubic foot refrigerators that can be supported by a wind turbine and solar panel economy thankfully botswana tanzania and other countries recognize that their continent is rich in coal oil natural gas hydro and uranium they intend to utilize those resources take charge of their destinies develop their economies and improve their people s lives by building coal and gas fired power plants hydroelectric facilities and pebble bed modular or other nuclear power plants they will also install wind turbines and solar panels in distant villages until electrical grids bring 24 7 365 power to the villages no single solution will work everywhere but under no circumstances are we going to apologize for developing africa s oil gas and coal fields equatorial guinea energy minister gabriel obiang lima has said adding it is criminal for any non african to suggest that africa should ignore any resources it has energy is the catalyst for growth says gwede mantashe south africa s new mineral resources and energy minister and national chair of its african national congress africa has long exported its oil and gas to the rest of the world while remaining energy deficient itself he noted during a recent africa oil week conference in cape town that is no longer tenable his new integrated resources plan includes coal and nuclear and all forms of energy as appropriate to a given time and situation south africa s trade unions now see that solar and wind will not create jobs or prosperity they promote coal power for inland areas where coal is plentiful and nuclear for coastal regions where water can cool reactors zambia kenya nigeria ghana and rwanda all appear prepared to join sa in going nuclear and zambia has a new zambian atomic energy agency zamatom headed by dr roland msiska it has begun building a nuclear center and preparing for a new generation of small modular nuclear reactors i am tired of being lectured by people in rich countries who have never lived a day without electricity says nigerian sam bada maybe they should just go home and turn off their fridge hot water laptops and lights then live like that for a month and tell us who have suffered for years not to burn coal energy deprivation perpetuates economic deprivation and creates breeding grounds for terrorist groups in weakened african nations recent islamic state attacks underscore this growing danger meanwhile too many banks lack the moral decency to stand up for fossil fuels or nuclear or question climate alarm doctrine if they continue to balk china could well step in and gain greater influence and expanded control of africa s raw materials in the process it would be much better if africa stood up for itself every new power plant generates electricity jobs better living standards and more tax revenues to build more power plants transmission lines and prosperity every country can do this just as china india and other nations have already there d be no better holiday gift than to banish greta the grinch from africa paul driessen is a senior policy analyst for the committee for a constructive tomorrow and

africa has the world s lowest electrification rate its power consumption per capita is just 613 kilowatt hours per year compared to 6 500 kwh in europe and 13 000 in the united states african development bank afdb president akinwumi adesina observed in july 2017 that s 9 4 of eu and 4 7 of us electricity consumption it s equivalent to americans having electricity only 1 hour a day 8 hours a week 411 hours per year at totally unpredictable times for a few minutes hours or days at a stretch it s actually even worse than that excluding significantly electrified south africa sub sahara africans consume an almost irrelevant 181 kwh of electricity per capita 1 4 of the average american s in sub saharan afria over 600 million people have no electricity and over 700 million rely on wood grass and dung for cooking and heating the region is home to 16 of the world s population and 53 of those without electricity by 2050 its urban populations could increase by 600 million determined to transform the dark continent the afdb launched a 12 billion new deal on energy in 2017 and a light up and power africa initiative in july 2018 it frequently emphasized that access to sufficient supplies of reliable affordable modern energy including fossil fuels is critical for the continent s social and economic development without energy it is impossible to create jobs increase productivity reduce inequality improve people s health and wellbeing or end poverty the bank s lofty goal for its energy new deal is 100 access to electricity in urban areas and 95 in rural areas by 2025 in july 2017 mr adesina told the african union summit he was excited that japan has answered our call to adopt a balanced energy mix that includes its ultra super critical clean coal technologies that remove sulfur nitrogen oxides and particulates while greatly reducing co2 emissions in 2018 the bank approved seed money for a nigerian coal project and geared up to finance a 350mw coal plant in senegal it also initiated plans for a 2 billion coal fired power station in the kenya s port city of lamu after the imf world bank and other western lenders rebuffed kenya but then mr adesina and the afdb caved in to carbon colonialist pressure the bank now says almost nothing about coal or even natural gas its new themes include responding to global concerns about climate change gradually adopting a low carbon and sustainable growth path significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning to green growth and clean renewable energy in september 2019 the bank announced that it planned to begin scrapping coal fired power plants all across africa build the largest solar zone in the world and pull funding for the lamu power plant we re getting out of coal mr adesina said coal is the past and renewable energy is the future so the afdb has joined the world bank goldman sachs and other multilateral anti development banks in caring more about climate alarmism and avoiding criticism from the likes of greta the perpetually aggrieved and angry grinch of christmas 2019 than they do about safeguarding the lives livelihoods health and living standards of hundreds of millions of electricity deprived africans this 180 degree flip flop is delusional dysfunctional and disingenuous for many it will be lethal first there is nothing green clean or renewable about wind and solar energy the vast amounts of land and raw materials mines and factories required to build wind turbines solar panels batteries and transmission lines to harness widely dispersed insufficient intermittent weather dependent wind and solar energy to benefit sub saharan africans are anything but clean green renewable or sustainable in fact trying to meet those needs would require millions of turbines and billions of solar panels second the afdb cannot possibly achieve its energy new deal or light up and power africa goals with wind and solar it will never reach 100 or even 25 access to meaningful electricity that way no country has ever built or sustained a modern economy this way and countries that have tried to by mandating wind solar and fossil fuel free economies are paying a terrible price headlines tell the story germany s green suicide industrial job losses top 80 000 german wind industry faces extinction 340 000 german families have pricey electricity cut off british steel faces insolvency british families are already deeply in debt to their energy suppliers before winter even sets in meanwhile the fossil and nuclear based us economy added another 266 000 jobs in november and wages also grew third there is no evidence to support claims that temperatures droughts and weather anywhere in africa are unprecedented or due to carbon dioxide from fossil fuels or from wood grass and dung fires they and other climate changes have been common throughout history and an energy rich prosperous africa will be far better able to deal with future changes than a poor energy deprived continent could fourth china india indonesia and other countries are not going stop building coal and gas fired power plants and emitting enormously more co2 why should africa and the afdb go down a different path finally banishing fossil fuels and nuclear and focusing on pseudo renewable energy will mean millions of children and parents will continue to suffer and die needlessly every year from diseases of poverty and energy deprivation this eco manslaughter at the hands of climate activists and banks must not continue africans have a fundamental human right to more than the few

by sa marketplace 2019 finishes with an extra kick for investors part of that is the continued strong run of the market erasing memories of last year s near bear market and extending the decade long bull there also are plenty of market headlines and events that have sprung over the end of the year from phase 1 trade deals to m a to political whirlwinds and more more trivially the 2010s are ending and the 2020s begin it has been quite a decade for equity investors with the s p 500 returning more than 250 in that time even underperformance could leave a portfolio in good shape and any alpha that was found would really leave investors well off where does that leave investors and the markets for 2020 at the start of a new decade that s what we try to answer in our annual marketplace roundtable series we are publishing roundtable discussions featuring more than 80 authors from across the spectrum of investing styles and focuses you find on seeking alpha macro to value investing small cap to energy gold to quant and alternative strategies and more today s discussion focuses on dividend investing a perennial hot topic on seeking alpha and a style that has had to adapt to a low rate environment again in 2019 we re featuring the following panel kirk spano author of margin of safety investing fredrik arnold author of the dividend dog catcher double dividend stocks author of hidden stock dividends plus dividend sensei author of the dividend kings robert honeywill author of analyst s cnr h2 supergrid canadian dividend growth investor author of dgi across north america richard berger author of engineered income investing the stock market has had another strong year recovering from last year s q4 correction the s p 500 has returned 10 annualized over the last two years as of early december yet there s still a sense that the music is due to stop among many investors see the theme of most hated bull market where do you fall out kirk spano it has been a great stock market for a decade with only a few lulls and minor corrections after the financial crisis it makes sense that the rebound was long and strong however the demographically driven slow growth forever global economy is structurally challenged that won t change for decades now debt is roughly back to 2007 levels and economic growth is slowing globally a number of factors from trade wars to the potential changing of the tax code in 2021 are threatening to act as catalysts to another correction that s on top of the steady drip of baby boomer money out of stocks in my view 2020 is shaping up to be a lot like 2018 double dividend stocks the two opposing themes are trade war fallout and mixed economic signals i don t see a smooth rise in 2020 but rather speed bumps along the way we ll also have the 2020 elections to stir the market up which will impact certain industries periodically lastly will the fed raise rates again in 2020 that s anyone s guess given the mixed economic signals fredrik arnold there s no bubble except a bearish media amplified expectation of a market collapse the 2020 melt up will continue but will not likely be sharp enough to burst the bearish bubble dividend sensei the s p as of december 16th is up 29 ytd and about 15 historically overvalued per jpmorgan asset management next year 5 to 5 returns are likely based on the 5 to 8 eps growth that s likely for 2020 historically normal 5 to 9 9 pullbacks are likely one or two of them and if the current melt up continues then a 2020 correction might happen purely due to valuations but a bear market is unlikely given 13 month recession risk of about 26 market timing is the worst thing investors can do according to 160 years of market data from the us uk and australia so don t try it robert honeywill levels of share price growth of recent years are unlikely to continue a leveling off with a degree of volatility rather than a sustained precipitous drop is likely this contention is supported by buffett in his 2016 letter both american corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed over the last several years the lowered return expectations of investors have driven up share prices resulting in large one off capital gains for those who remained invested through this period this might seem counterintuitive but large capital gains cannot be expected to be achieved during the next five years unless investor return expectations are driven even lower which is nevertheless possible richard berger engineered income investing focuses on value not momentum as an income strategy it also targets high quality dividend tickers thus we are not concerned nor overly exposed to the aging bull market or market volatility in general in fact because we use covered option writing to boost income and yield while reducing market risk we actually benefit from the market volatility which tends to increase option premiums we earn what s a lesson you learned in 2019 kirk spano traders carry a lot more power in a thinly traded and etf driven stock market we have to be respectful of asset price trends and be ever more mindful to maintain a margin of safety that means technical and quantitative analysis are more important now than when simply buying value worked for position traders and long term investors like me i am constantly reminding them to avoid the middle of the market if risk is a concern instead buy the extreme edges of the markets what i call bottom fishing prices as there are enough opportunities caused by traders that a patient approach to buying works double dividend stocks take management s investor presentations andearnings callpromises with a larger grain of salt fredrik arnold international investing is safer than domestic speculation dividend sensei buffett was right and the market will always surprise you in 2019 our biggest winners have been quality companies that had positive fundamentals yet fell into completely irrational bear markets we bought steadily and are now up 30 to 40 as a result of those positions robert honeywill the importance of attempting to gain a better understanding of all of the factors that drive the formation of pe ratios for individual stocks and at sector level richard berger 2019 began with most pundits bemoaning a year with a negative outlook backed by a market correction to start the year investors who were moved to the sidelines or otherwise prepared for that outlook paid a steep lost opportunity price because eii strategy is designed to thrive in both bull and bear markets and the transitions between them we stayed the course and have had another excellent year 2019 again emphasized the need to manage risk as part of a total market strategy instead of allowing markets to manage you what was the biggest story for you from 2019 kirk spano another historic crash for oil and gas stocks after a rebound in 2017 and 2018 i covered the reasons why in an article titled here s why oil stocks are priced for armageddon in short there s a battle raging among investors with different views of how fast the oil age will end that crash also was a signal the alternative energy ev and smart grid era is coming for oil stocks even in a run off situation no growth and slow decline there appear to be some value opportunities but will enough investors buy the stocks to matter i think so the companies themselves are buying back shares and paying dividends that return of capital to shareholders could be very valuable it s already attracting private equity and vulture investors we will need to be mindful to sell the rips if there are rallies in oil stocks buying some oil stocks now is my exception to the underlying growth rule for dividend stocks double dividend stocks north state telecommunications norsb a core holding in our hidden dividend stocks plus marketplace service is getting bought out for a 34 premium in addition to the buyout premium hds subscribers received two years of fat dividends yielding over 8 for a total return of 51 since inception fredrik arnold the continued dominance of dividend investment vehicles as a means of preserving and growing wealth dividend sensei maximum safe dividend has always been our goal and in 2019 we saw numerous yield traps slash or suspend dividends like value trap cbl the stock s reaction to suspending its dividends including preferred stock dividends shows that cuts are almost never actually priced in avoiding yield traps and sticking to above average or better quality companies is the best way to not just sleep well at night but also achieve better long term returns both on an absolute basis and a risk adjusted one robert honeywill my biggest story was my june 12 article rh rh expect a strong q1 beat trigger for a massive short squeeze currently up 138 my biggest dividend story was my january 9 article kellogg k dgi opportunity the share price currently is up 14 98 and dividend yield on cost is 3 9 based on price at publication outstanding for a dividend king canadian dividend growth investor we had multiple big stories in 2019 ideas bought during the year that delivered double digit returns within the year the best ones were cvs health cvs shares bought in the low 50s in april that are up 39 of course we generally buy stocks intending for long term investment and we have had ideas that have generated substantial gains over multiple years richard berger defensive market sentiment toward quality dividends consumer staples utilities selected tech and away from reits provided strong favorable tailwinds to our eii portfolios which focus on income tickers based on value entry and exit points the reappearance of fed qe market intercession to manage liquidity was a surprise that provided added benefits one of the theories about dividend investing is that high quality companies will continue to pay out dividends which provides a cushion in bad markets whether in the money or in the psychological benefit of receiving income do you buy that or how do you prepare for potential turbulence let s say worse than q4 2018 kirk spano i think a lot of people confuse what is high quality and what isn t the holy grail for dividend investors should be to find companies that have at least some underlying organic growth these companies are best able to withstand and recover from recessions companies that have falling revenues high debt or are engaging in financial engineering to keep dividends up are the trouble of the next correction that s where the pain will be worst in the next correction as many of those stocks are bid up to irrational valuations so their current dividends won t really help if the share prices are cut in half and eventually followed by dividend cuts or they cut dividends and their share prices are cut in half the way to look at dividend stocks is as two groups those in decline with high financial risk vs those with underlying growth and improving fundamentals the second group is where to buy even if their yields today are a little lower double dividend stocks it comes down to capital allocation for management in the crash of 2008 many dow 30 and s p 500 dividend stocks cut their dividends when they saw how high their yield had risen i was fortunate enough to have bought some of the stocks that didn t cut their dividends at fantastic yields which i m still holding fredrik arnold it would take a nuclear holocaust to dislodge the security of dividend investing dividend sensei according to ned davis research from 1972 to 2018 dividend growth stocks outperformed the broader market by 2 3 cagr and with 12 less volatility to boot a company with sufficiently stable cash flows to generate a long dividend growth streak is a great choice for most investors and income investors tend to be less likely to run for the hills during times of increased market fear while no dividend stock is a true bond alternative quality dividend growth stocks like the famous aristocrats tend to have much lower volatility over time volatility dividend growth quality and value are four proven alpha factors that have beaten the market over the decades dividend kings similarly tries to stack the deck in our members favor by focusing on those four alpha strategies all part of our overall motto of quality first valuation second and prudent risk management always robert honeywill i do buy that and bad markets are great for long term dgi investors who drip because they get more shares for their dividends when share prices are down hold through the bad times and come out a bigger winner when the good times return canadian dividend growth investor yes we buy this certain stocks fall much less in a market crash johnson johnson jnj falls in this category we ve added to the stock whenever we found it decently attractive and it has been doing is job having little volatility and providing a safe and growing dividend richard berger companies that have a history of unbroken and undiminished dividends for 25 50 and 100 years are not accidents some will falter in any given year but those records prove the commitment to support the dividend in all but the last extreme those extremes are usually very easy to anticipate by monitoring the canary in the coal mine metrics of cash flow trends which are the engines of dividend health focus on value and monitor for dividend safety and you should weather market cycles with little trouble where do you fall out on yield vs total return and why kirk spano i m a total return investor because growth is an important component to being able to maintain dividend payments in the long term companies with high yields are often at risk for a number of reasons from high debt to slow or no growth those risks can result in rising payout ratios that can t be maintained long term those companies are walking on thin ice which is fine until of course a crack turns into an ice bath companies with at least some growth are more able to pay down debt and buy back shares buying back shares makes their yields more attractive in fact share buybacks in the past decade have proven to be extremely important in maintaining not only share price but dividend yield give me underlying organic growth and conservative financials for total return double dividend stocks as an income investor i m much more interested in companies whose cumulative yield forms the majority of their total return most income investors myself included want to receive dependable monthly and quarterly income from their investments vs having to try and trade in and out of stocks in order to earn a living fredrik arnold yield is a strong signal for any dividend dogcatcher it is both attractive and cautionary and the strength of future yield is totally dependent on the ability of the company to sustain its cash flow yield in excess of dividend yield in other words without returns the yield disappears eventually dividend sensei we have four portfolios targeting different companies for different goals and needs over time high yield tends to have slower growth while faster growing companies have lower yields since 1956 the gordon dividend growth model which john bogle swore by has shown that total returns are a function of starting yield long term growth valuation changes dividend kings owns above average or better quality companies with a wide range of yields and growth rates our goal is to create portfolios with above average yields relative to their benchmark etfs equal or better long term growth rates and equal or better valuation such a portfolio using prudent risk management that fits your needs is the best way to maximize both long term safe income over time and also achieve the kind of total returns that can meet your financial goals robert honeywill total return for an investor in shares can only be realized through receipt of dividends and or gain on sale at the end of the day total return from an investment is what matters yield from dividends is important because a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and for many investors receipt of dividends meets their cash needs without resorting to selling the underlying shares canadian dividend growth investor in general for all stocks i aim for 10 total returns however there are some exceptions for example i mentioned johnson johnson in an earlier response it s higher quality so i m alright with getting say 9 total return from it but we have been doing better than that so far with our buys in the stock for growth oriented stocks i certainly try to aim for 12 total returns for stocks that yield 5 i d surely aim for the minimum 10 total return target the more likely a recession or bear market is going to happen soon the more inclined we are to add to more yield oriented names but ones that still offer stable growth typically we want a growth component to our holdings richard berger income investors like myself and my subscribers must focus on both you cannot have one without the other yield without total net return is actually just a yield trap eii strategies are designed to generate high yield income with reduced market risk even across short term negative total return periods thus giving time for total return recovery without the pressure to replace income this is just one of many risk management tools incorporated into our strategies what s an interesting trend you re seeing from dividend investing whether from the companies themselves or from investors who are making decisions in this space kirk spano investors are bidding up dividend paying stocks to unprecedented valuations i ve even had millennials tell me to give them dividend paying stocks peg ratios price earnings growth above 2 are common which is very un peter lynch like what s worse many dividend stocks are being bid up despite no earnings growth that is a negative peg this chasing will end badly for a lot of people double dividend stocks companies have been moving to stronger dividend coverage vs higher growth in addition to moving to lower debt leverage a greater percent of cash flow is being used to self fund expansion projects vs funding them with 100 debt fredrik arnold the quest for quality at any price the cost of an average share of the dow index is now 50 overpriced dividend sensei i m very pleased to see fast growing tech companies like skyworks swks broadcom avgo apple aapl and lam research lrcx and others embrace rising dividends i m seeing more management teams on conference calls state their dedication to rising dividends over time and as a result expect the number of tech names in the dividend aristocrats list to grow steadily over time i love tech dividend stocks at the right valuation of course and the more quality candidates we have to choose from the better and more profitable our master list of 400 companies can become in the future robert honeywill chasing yield is probably the biggest single factor driving p e multiple expansion over the last 5 to 10 years companies can greatly influence share price levels through dividend policy for a company actively repurchasing shares the level of dividends may influence the repurchase price what s good for the company does not necessarily align with shareholder interests i have a process for identifying shareholder friendly and shareholder unfriendly companies and the latter is to be avoided no matter how good company performance richard berger dividend income investing is becoming more and more popular as population ages it also can provide the most reliable and predictable growth total net return for long horizon investors while minimizing downside volatility when proper strategies are used i have developed eii strategies to avoid the negative parts of dgi dividend capture and other focused dividend income strategies valuation is all important in selecting entry and exit points for even the best dividends after all any company may be a bargain or overpriced at a given moment what are you going to be focused on for 2020 kirk spano the transition to the smart everything world continues to move forward and that trend is accelerating i want to find asset light tech companies as well as companies across all sectors benefiting from tech that pass money back to shareholders i also see a return of scarcity to certain markets in the 2020s due to underinvestment in the past decade i want to find resource plays in metals minerals water and fertilizer that have pricing power derived from good assets and strong fundamentals here i ll toss in one pick i think nutrien ntr which is the leader in potash and is now vertically integrated after the merger of potash corp and agrium is poised for a huge decade double dividend stocks more diversification into other sectors with strong macro tailwinds such as healthcare and tech however we may do this via backdoor dividend stocks that support these industries fredrik arnold this dividend dog catcher will continue to focus on tracking down outstanding proven dividend winners dividend sensei our mission will never change quality first valuation second prudent risk management always our service has 24 five star reviews not just because we re making our members money via actionable recommendations each week and our valuation total return potential lists but because we help guide members through periods of normal and healthy market volatility we help them to understand what political economic interest rate news is noise and what matters to their long term financial goals as buffett said we don t have to be smarter than the rest we have to be more disciplined than the rest robert honeywill gaining a better understanding of the factors driving p e multiple expansion and contraction across all sectors while p e multiple contraction affects unrealized gains losses on shareholdings it also increases dividend yields available on high quality shares so it s not without opportunities for dgi investors canadian dividend growth investor as usual we re focused on quality valuation dividend safety and growth additionally we have several megatrends that we have our eyes set on although valuation prevents us from buying some areas today richard berger staying focused and on course with eii income strategies will continue in 2020 the further the bull ages the more inclined i m to manage for downside protection while maintaining superior double digit income yields i also find many special opportunities and arbitrage trades available in these aged bull markets to provide strong yield with lower risk what s a favorite idea for 2020 and what s the story kirk spano investors must sell old economy stocks in disrupted industries high debt low growth and technologically behind companies will suffer as the smart everything world continues to emerge when the next correction hits a lot of companies will never recover again sell them ahead of the next correction to avoid permanent loss of capital on that next correction buy the disruptors and companies that use technology well to get ahead of the competition double dividend stocks industrial logistics properties trust ilpt is a high yield backdoor to amazon and e commerce ilpt yields over 6 and amazon amzn is its biggest tenant fredrik arnold medical property real estate investment trusts pay healthy dividends and have a long life expectancy just the thing to produce a steady stream of passive income for the savvy investor dividend sensei one of our highest conviction buys is bristol myers bmy due to 46 to 136 growth in fundamentals per share ranging from eps operating cash flow ebitda and ebit that s courtesy of the hyper accretive 74 billion celgene celg acquisition despite a 50 rally since late july it s still extremely undervalued 109 fair value in 2020 and we re buying more every week until it goes above 76 and is no longer a very strong buy robert honeywill the emergence of hydrogen fuel cells as serious competitors to batteries for electric motor driven transport australia has vast sunny spaces and is planning a transition from supplying coal to the world to supplying hydrogen with australian developed technology to back it up what good are bevs to japan unless the electricity to recharge batteries comes from clean fuel sources japan is positioning to move to a hydrogen economy with its own developed technology and is cooperating with australian interests through joint ventures this is a developing story and there will be much to investigate and analyze in 2020 to identify the potential winners and losers watch out for twiggy forrest and his fortescue metals group fsumf for green energy and other environmental initiatives canadian dividend growth investor the china u s trade tensions dragged down the valuations for chinese stocks in 2019 the phase 1 deal has led to a nice pop in some chinese stocks like alibaba baba and tencent tcehy additionally a greater gdp growth than north america and a growing middle class population will be growth drivers for china tencent is a leader in social networks online gaming fintech and much more the stock has been one of the top ideas in our dgi across north america service for quite some time now and we ve added to it over time however there s still lots of growth runway for tencent in 2020 and beyond despite the stock appreciating roughly 20 in the last few months from a low so it remains one of our favorite buy and hold dividend growth ideas richard berger value focused investment strategy will remain key and become even more important as the bull continues to age even in late stage bulls even in bear markets individual tickers will still arise with excellent bargain value prices available knowing how to find these and maximize gains while minimizing risk is what eii strategy is designed for the easing of

trump is enjoying a burst of applause from the new trade agreement between our nation canada and mexico but he owes that applause in part to democrats who were looking out for american interests and he should hope americans don t come to understand the deep long term damage team trump is doing to our economy overall trump s trade policies notably on environmentally friendly electric generation equipment soybeans and intellectual property are big losers for america congressional democrats agreed to the revised usmc agreement only after changes were made at their insistence to improve opportunities and competitive conditions for american workers pelosi said the new deal will be infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration for example within a few years 40 to 45 of cars must be made in factories that pay workers at least 16 an hour a policy that affects only mexico where average auto worker pay is just 2 60 an hour showing they could negotiate and impeach at the same time house democrats approved the new trade agreement the day after voting to impeach trump they have also passed more than 400 bills most of them with bipartisan support that now molder on the desk of mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader there is no question of course that this trade agreement is much better than nafta speaker nancy pelosi said in announcing the bipartisan agreement on usmca pelosi said the new deal will be infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration trump s plan would have cut auto production team trump s initial proposed rules on automobile manufacturing would lead to a decline in production of vehicles and parts in all three north american countries with shifts toward greater sourcing of both vehicles and parts from outside of the region analysis by the international monetary fund imf found the revised rules make that calamity less likely under other changes negotiated by the democrats the usmca should make it possible to organize independent unions in mexico will require serious safety inspections and impose environmental rules so that mexican manufacturers do not gain a cost advantage by avoiding the costs of cleaning up their pollutants the democrats failed however to revise or kill section 230 which gives social media firms such as facebook a general immunity for what they let others publish on their websites the russian military has made extensive use of facebook to spread disinformation including buying ads facebook founder jeff zuckerberg says he won t stop the use of facebook to spread kremlin propaganda now let s look at some other trade issues trade in solar panels trump regularly denounces wind power asserting that it destroy everybody s property values kill all the birds and in december he ranted about fumes and other ludicrous claims against wind turbines which supply about 8 of u s electricity his tariffs would significantly slow the growth of electricity from wind a form of subtle subsidy for coal the dirtiest of fuels trump s solar panel tariffs will cost 62 000 american jobs and reduce investment by 19 billion from 2017 through 2020 according to a solar industry study that lost investment means 1 8 million fewer homes will rely on solar power and there will be 26 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions that could have been voided the administration argues that it is actually helping the solar industry by reducing its reliance on imported photovoltaic panels and related equipment who sought these tariffs two bankrupt solar panel makers both foreign owned suniva a chinese owned company in georgia and solarworld americas a german owned company in oregon protecting inefficient enterprises raises costs long term and creates a drag on economic growth farm bailouts benefit richest owners trump s war on american soybeans has helped spur increases in midwest farm bankruptcies according to the american farm bureau of course trump claims the opposite he gives credit to using your tax dollars to subsidize farmers who cannot sell their products in china but without mentioning you or the taxes you pay our great farmers will recieve another major round of cash compliments of china tariffs prior to thanksgiving trump tweeted on nov 17 the smaller farms and farmers will be big beneficiaries what trump calls china tariffs are in reality a tax increase because the costs are born by americans through either higher prices or for business owners reduced profits but big corporate farms not yeoman farmers benefit most from trump s taxpayer bailout an analysis of government records by the environmental working group found the bottom 80 of affected farms will get on average just 5 136 some may collect only 1 the ewg pointed out that the top 10 of recipients the biggest and most profitable industrial scale farms in the country have received half of the 6 billion in aid given since august their average 177 000 each ewg found that the richest of the rich farmers the top 1 received 13 of the federal payments three were given more than 1 million each and 45 got more than 500 000 and the payments have been slow taxpayers have had to pay more than 1 million just in interest for late payments to farmers rejecting republican policy trump s trade policies are mostly about erecting protectionist barriers which republicans opposed on principle before the party morphed into the trump cult in the short run protectionism will result in more jobs in specific industries that get protection and can raise prices but the economic damage costs far more than the benefits trump tariffs are a net loser for decades the goal of american trade policy has been making it easier to trade manufactured goods that also has the effect of enabling corporate employers to take advantage of low cost labor in the developing world the net effect in america downward pressure on wages for the poorly educated whom trump professes to love but those who have kept their jobs in manufacturing tend to be better educated with at least some college trump has been aggressively anti union so much so that what is still legally named the department of labor has morphed into the department of management rights team trump delays job safety protections kills job safety training that saves lives predictably worker deaths are rising where safety enforcement is falling overall union rights are under constant assault and then there s the trump administration love of child labor which is both immoral and will tend to put more downward pressure on wages how many of the poorly educated who support trump know about these and other policies designed to make them worse off without a doubt trade has been bad for lower skilled manufacturing workers in the first 15 years of this century 5 5 million manufacturing jobs vanished bureau of labor statistics data show most of them lost during the george w bush administration unionized workers were hit the hardest about 40 of union manufacturing jobs vanished twice the overall rate of job loss so the better paid were more likely to lose than were lesser paid factory workers a good deal for trump with one notable and self serving exception trump has done nothing to lower the costs americans bear by reducing trade in services indeed trump rarely mentions services and many of his comments suggest that despite a degree in economics he doesn t understand that there are two components of trade data goods and services trump has made it easier for him to hire foreign workers at mar a lago his florida resort under a visa program he does this by claiming he cannot find workers in the palm beach area even though thousands are looking for such work how does trump get away with it trump puts a single blind classified ad in a newspaper each year applicants have a very brief period to respond and must do so via fax a technology few low paid workers possess on the other side team trump maintains barriers for professionals which in turn raises costs to consumers americans would save about 700 per family annually if we just allowed qualified doctors trained in places like canada and germany to practice in the united states economist dean baker calculated that s 100 billion per year we could save the liberalization of trade in goods is largely a done deal according to baker tariffs are already zero or near zero in the vast majority of cases the potential gains from further liberalization are limited because people are spending a diminishing share of their income on goods the growth is in services not manufactured products
the u s rural economy will continue to face headwinds in 2020 and is expected to underperform relative to the economy of urban america since 2014 gross domestic product gdp growth in rural counties has averaged almost 1 less than in urban counties that trend is likely to continue without a significant upswing in agricultural commodity prices energy exploration rural manufacturing and other industries upon which rural economic growth depends despite that bearish prognosis there is room for optimism according to a comprehensive 2020 outlook report from cobank s knowledge exchange division the u s farm economy has demonstrated its resiliency in the face of trade wars extreme weather and other disruptive events while the downside impact of trade disputes and tariffs will remain severe for many some agriculture sectors will see stronger exports and higher prices rising animal protein and dairy exports will be a bright spot for producers in 2020 most current signals indicate the overall domestic economy is on firm footing thanks almost exclusively to the consumer said dan kowalski vice president of cobank s knowledge exchange division however without a meaningful u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with uncertainty in 2020 the cobank 2020 outlook report examined 10 key factors that will shape agriculture and market sectors that serve and affect rural communities throughout the u s global economy less trade slower growth after a year of trade tensions declining gdp and the slowest global economic growth since the depths of the financial crisis the world s leading economies hope to turn the page in 2020 the prognosis however offers little to support such optimism consumer strength the world over has prevented further slowing in the global economy the direction and severity of the u s china trade dispute will continue to have the most significant influence on the world economy in 2020 a leveling off of trade tensions would allow global economic growth to bottom out in early 2020 before showing signs of life later in the year however the vulnerable state of the global economy makes it susceptible to contraction if trade conditions worsen u s economy expansion for those left behind the u s economy will enter 2020 decisively split powered by a resilient and confident consumer but hamstrung by a risk averse business sector that has stopped investing now that stimulus effects from the 2017 tax reform and the 2018 spending bill have faded the economic expansion will show its age losing steam in the coming year there is evidence that since 2017 more people including those in rural communities have broadly shared the benefits of economic growth despite the continual rise in wealth inequality monetary policy sustain and prepare all eyes will be on the central banks as the world inches closer to the end of the longest period of economic growth in history japan and europe are still stimulating their economies with negative interest rates and quantitative easing after three rate cuts in 2019 the u s federal reserve bank is holding a more conservative stance with its target rate near 1 5 china has the most room to maneuver with its short term rate just under 3 all of these accommodative stances are made possible because inflation remains inexplicably low despite tightening labor markets the role of federal reserve chair jerome powell in 2020 is to keep the late stage expansion going while simultaneously preparing for the recession that will arrive sooner or later u s government policy and trade up in the air agricultural policy at the federal level has been wrought with uncertainty and volatility the trade environment for 2020 remains hazy as well beyond a possible u s china phase one deal more progress with china will be a challenge as a result it is difficult to see trade as a bright spot in 2020 the atmosphere in washington d c today has given way to progress on agricultural labor legislation and the u s mexico canada agreement usmca but a protracted partisan fight over impeachment is on tap in the senate this rancor makes it difficult to advance legislation that helps agriculture which would give either side a win for the hotly contested 2020 election market facilitation program payments to farmers helped make up for persistently low commodity prices in the last year u s farm economy trade uncertainty lingers without a substantive u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with trade uncertainty in 2020 as questions linger as to whether u s department of agriculture will continue to soften the blow of the trade war for farmers and ranchers with government payments amid persistently low commodity prices and rising costs u s farmers and ranchers continue to struggle with low and declining working capital farm debt already at record levels is expected to continue climbing as credit quality in farm loans declines particularly for grain and dairy producers however stable farm real estate values have helped farmers the resiliency of farmland values despite the steep drop in net farm income over the years has allowed farmers to restructure debt and address tight cash flow and liquidity crunches specialty crops labor and water in the spotlight fruit nut and vegetable markets will continue to face rising production costs in 2020 due to mounting regulations particularly as they relate to controls over groundwater in california regulations under the state s sustainable groundwater management act sgma are about to go into effect and could potentially cause acreage shifts between crops of varying water needs other government action in 2020 could have a favorable impact on specialty crop growers the farm workforce modernization act currently being debated in congress is a hopeful sign for an improved regulatory environment for agricultural labor if passed it would help ease the tight labor supply plaguing agriculture grain farm supply and biofuels time to transform challenges for the grain sector will persist in 2020 fueled by commodity price pressure policy uncertainty and export weakness amid growing global supply abundance especially for corn and soybeans u s wheat producers and exporters though may benefit from an improved export pace in 2020 with russia s wheat crop struggling biofuels also face challenges in 2020 u s ethanol production according to the u s energy information administration is expected to fall 1 9 in 2019 to 15 8 billion gal and remain flat in 2020 the outlook for farm supply companies is mixed and continues to be heavily influenced by weather to improve its value proposition this sector is actively pursuing vertical and horizontal consolidation dairy and animal protein export your way to success with dairy and animal protein production looking toward another year of increased production in 2020 a rebound in exports will be critical to profitability in both sectors per capita consumption of animal protein in the u s will likely set a new record in 2019 overall dairy consumption in the u s will remain strong in 2020 as americans continue eating more cheese and butter but fluid milk will likely continue its long term decline strong demand and rising exports though will not erase financial stress at the farm level producers of beef pork poultry and dairy will likely experience stress from higher feed costs due to lower crop yields this fall rural electricity demand grows for cleaner lower cost power companies throughout the electricity supply chain are likely to face heightened simultaneous demands for cleaner and less expensive power generation in 2020 these pressures reflect the intense concern about climate change wealth and income inequality and slowing economic growth three issues americans rank as equally important in recent polling in many rural communities these concerns are likely to manifest in more numerous and more vehement calls for greater renewable power generation for utilities the task of justifying multimillion dollar expenditures on new renewable resources will be easier in 2020 as the unsubsidized costs of solar wind battery energy storage and flexible natural gas fired resources continue to decline rural communications investors come to buy rural and regional telecommunications operators will become targets in 2020 for investors and strategic buyers as the pool of available midsized fiber transport companies dries up demand for these companies has been so strong that valuations are reaching levels that were unthinkable a few years ago mergers and acquisition activity in rural markets should be brisk as the growth in data traffic offers attractive returns for investors and opportunities for strategic buyers to gain scale and access to new markets also 2020 will bring the launch of the rural digital opportunity fund the latest broadband incentive program from the federal communications commissions and its largest effort to close the urban rural digital divide
from brexit to the gilets jaunes protest movements in europe and elsewhere have shocked political elites in recent years at their heart is a sense that economic growth has left many people worse off even if in most countries the headline gdp figures suggest that countries are much wealthier challenging the idea that economic growth will automatically lead to development and wellbeing is one of the main themes in the 2019 human development report by the un development programme undp published in december achim steiner the administrator of the undp told euractiv that policy makers need to look beyond the gdp figures and economic indices that simply do not capture the perception is that things are not getting better but that they are in fact getting worse and that is breeding distrust of the political process income per capita and gdp is an inadequate way to respond to growing inequalities you have to go beyond averages we need a more calibrated view of where a country is at that looks at the basic health and education indicators added steiner europe has seen some of the biggest gains in human development over the past decade ireland had the highest increase in rank on the report s accompanying human development index hdi rising 13 places between 2013 and 2018 seven of the top 10 positions on the hdi are held by european countries five of which are members of the european union yet european countries have generally experienced the same broad inequality trends as countries elsewhere both income and wealth inequality have deepened in many countries even though inequalities drop significantly after taxes and transfers more importantly disparities persist in health and education its estimates show the top 10 pretax income earners received 29 of total regional income in 1980 rising to 34 in 2017 the incomes of the top 0 1 of earners more than doubled during the period and the incomes of the top 0 001 nearly tripled the bottom 50 received 24 of total regional income in 1980 but only 20 by 2017 meanwhile despite overall reductions in poverty hunger and disease a new generation of inequalities is opening up according to the hdr we want a more constructive and empowering debate in countries said steiner adding that the purpose of the report is to connect countries and increase understanding inequality beyond the traditional yardsticks that will yield better policy outcomes steiner believes that we are seeing the emergence of 21st century inequalities such as access to higher education pointing out that access to tertiary education is developing 15 times faster in wealthier countries similar patterns and social divides are emerging outside europe in developing countries and it tends to be the lower middle class that suffers the most steiner points out that although colombia is about to join the organisation for economic co operation and development the paris based group of wealthy countries because of conflict one third of its population are left unserved by the state one of the questions that steiner wants political leaders across the world to address is what is fair globalisation although the undp works with the economist thomas piketty co director of the world inequality lab in paris the report says that radical changes to taxation policy particularly increases are not going to be enough on their own inequalities begin before birth said steiner pointing out that the average american child in a wealthy family has more than 300 words in their vocabulary far more than their counterparts across most of the world tax is not everything he adds steiner believes instead that more efficient tax collection alongside efforts to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share is the way forward particularly in developing countries across africa we have a tax base that far exceeds receipts from development aid and that is a turn around from the 1960s africa s ability to finance their development has rapidly grown tax authorities are becoming far more efficient in terms of revenue collection he added he also pointed to countries where administrations have introduced e government platforms and also digitised land ownership and financial services kenya is turning upside the traditional methods of financial inclusion m pesa takes away the transaction costs you can borrow money in the morning buy your goods to sell in the market and then repay the loan in the evening said steiner he said one of the common messages being borne out of the undp s research is about the lack of fairness in economic growth and development i m losing my dignity is the phrase we heard in latin america he added the protests have a trigger steiner said pointing to the wave of demonstrations across europe and elsewhere it is the combustion that has accumulated in many societies at a point people say enough we need to understand why people feel the way that they do and that is where economists have been falling short read more with euractiv johnson takes control but charts a bumpy brexit course the uk will leave the eu in january but the article 50 process was always supposed to

the real estate sector may be one critical area that china s policymakers should closely monitor in the next year to ensure that the country will win the tough battle of forestalling major financial risks we should bear in mind that the period from 2018 to 2020 marks a peak of debt redemption faced by chinese borrowers which means an adequate supply of funds must be ensured to shield any risks of large scale defaults and even a financial crisis conditions of the housing market meanwhile have significant impacts on the supply of funds and the overall financial situation sharp rises and drops in property prices could both be dangerous if property prices rise so much that more money floods the real estate sector through trusts and other financial instruments as well as individuals speculative investments the sector will strain the supply of funds for other sectors on the contrary if property prices drop too sharply real estate developers may see weaker solvency and individuals may default on mortgages let alone other potential chain effects therefore if property prices can be stabilized so that the real estate sector can tide over any potential financial stress the world s second largest economy may face a much easier situation of financial risks in 2020 beijing s pre owned home market seems to be facing a trend where prices remain high but people are reluctant to buy when i worked at a real estate agency last year to observe the attitude of property sellers and buyers i found that though property owners asked high prices on agency platforms they mark the prices down when it finally comes to a deal this phenomenon has alerted me to a question who will pay for the highly priced properties whether or not drops in property prices could be within a tolerable range that will be a crucial issue in 2020 if property prices fall too quickly the authorities should postpone policies to curb the property price bubble such as the real estate tax to ensure a stable financial situation given the significance of the property sector for financial stability we can understand the tone setting annual central economic work conference s requirement of property sector policies to stabilize land prices home prices and market expectations and carry out policy adjustments based on each city s actual market condition another important precondition for adequate supply of funds in 2020 is a stable stock market which in turn entails a better rule of law in the market given the current speed of law based reforms china s a share market may welcome an inflection point or upside potential in 2020 the stock market matters in terms of guaranteeing supply of funds because many listed companies have outstanding loans using their stocks as collateral this means that on deep stock price declines listed firms may be forced to sell their stocks to redeem the loans which will constrain funds available for normal uses to prevent such risks associated with stock price plunges regulators should promote improvements in fundamentals and governance of listed firms reduce administrative controls and encourage more mid to long term funds such as those from insurers and the social security system to enter the market the central economic work conference called for efforts to improve fundamental institutions governing the capital markets and to improve the quality of listed companies as well as to complete delisting mechanisms which will get more low quality listed firms out of the market from the perspective of economic growth a slowdown in the property sector also mirrors the contraction of old engines of china s economy i expect that 2020 will still be a key year of economic restructuring so it is necessary to boost emerging industries to counter downward pressure from weaker old engines besides the real estate sector traditional manufacturing sectors such as auto and construction may continue to see contraction and adjustments in 2020 meanwhile strategic emerging industries such as new energy and new materials the services sector and modern manufacturing industries such as aircraft and high speed train manufacturing will strengthen their role of new growth engines in the next year we need to promote development and even breakthroughs in all the three sectors to maintain a reasonable economic growth also it is necessary to speed up optimizing the business environment and continue reducing taxes and fees charged on enterprises to re vitalize enterprises by reducing all kinds of burdens on them based on our estimations the government has cut 1 5 trillion yuan 214 billion worth of value added tax and 500 billion yuan worth of fees on enterprises in total for 2020 this could ease the pressure of rising costs on many businesses but more could be done i suggest that the government continue the tax cut campaign in 2020 by reducing number of the value added tax brackets from three to two i would argue that downward pressure in 2020 will mainly arise from domestic factors especially restructuring while the trade friction with the united states may exert a weaker negative impact on the chinese economy this is not only because that the two countries have agreed on the text to the much anticipated phase one trade deal but because that a large portion of impacts of the trade friction on the chinese economy has been digested in the longer run external uncertainties may remain but this should not obstruct china s pace toward a steady and quality development if the three tasks discussed below could be completed first the country should strengthen its advantages of manufacturing and large scale market by addressing weak links in its manufacturing sector and opening its markets of production resources services and investments second china needs to further facilitate technological innovation and motivate more people to engage in innovation third a more comprehensive trade and investment system including better financial and legal frameworks is needed to serve the belt and road initiative the writer is a honghai chair professor at the school of economics and management tsinghua university and a winner of the china economic theory innovation award for 2019

the 7 reasons why nuclear energy is not the answer to solve climate change mark z jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering director atmosphere energy program stanford university dicaprio foundation jun 20 2019 there is a small group of scientists that have proposed replacing 100 of the world s fossil fuel power plants with nuclear reactors as a way to solve climate change many others propose nuclear grow to satisfy up to 20 percent of all our energy not just electricity needs they advocate that nuclear is a clean carbon free source of power but they don t look at the human impacts of these scenarios let s do the math one nuclear power plant takes on average about 14 1 2 years to build from the planning phase all the way to operation according to the world health organization about 7 1 million people die from air pollution each year with more than 90 of these deaths from energy related combustion so switching out our energy system to nuclear would result in about 93 million people dying as we wait for all the new nuclear plants to be built in the all nuclear scenario utility scale wind and solar farms on the other hand take on average only 2 to 5 years from the planning phase to operation rooftop solar pv projects are down to only a 6 month timeline so transitioning to 100 renewables as soon as possible would result in tens of millions fewer deaths this illustrates a major problem with nuclear power and why renewable energy in particular wind water and solar wws avoids this problem nuclear though doesn t just have one problem it has seven here are the seven major problems with nuclear energy 1 long time lag between planning and operation the time lag between planning and operation of a nuclear reactor includes the times to identify a site obtain a site permit purchase or lease the land obtain a construction permit obtain financing and insurance for construction install transmission negotiate a power purchase agreement obtain permits build the plant connect it to transmission and obtain a final operating license the planning to operation pto times of all nuclear plants ever built have been 10 19 years or more for example the olkiluoto 3 reactor in finland was proposed to the finnish cabinet in december 2000 to be added to an existing nuclear power plant its latest estimated completion date is 2020 giving it a pto time of 20 years the hinkley point nuclear plant was planned to start in 2008 it has an estimated completion year of 2025 to 2027 giving it a pto time of 17 to 19 years the vogtle 3 and 4 reactors in georgia were first proposed in august 2006 to be added to an existing site the anticipated completion dates are november 2021 and november 2022 respectively given them pto times of 15 and 16 years respectively the haiyang 1 and 2 reactors in china were planned to start in 2005 haiyang 1 began commercial operation on october 22 2018 haiyang 2 began operation on january 9 2019 giving them pto times of 13 and 14 years respectively the taishan 1 and 2 reactors in china were bid in 2006 taishan 1 began commercial operation on december 13 2018 taishan 2 is not expected to be connected until 2019 giving them pto times of 12 and 13 years respectively planning and procurement for four reactors in ringhals sweden started in 1965 one took 10 years the second took 11 years the third took 16 years and the fourth took 18 years to complete many claim that france s 1974 messmer plan resulted in the building of its 58 reactors in 15 years this is not true the planning for several of these nuclear reactors began long before for example the fessenheim reactor obtained its construction permit in 1967 and was planned starting years before in addition 10 of the reactors were completed between 1991 2000 as such the whole planning to operation time for these reactors was at least 32 years not 15 that of any individual reactor was 10 to 19 years creative commons wikimedia 2 cost the levelized cost of energy lcoe for a new nuclear plant in 2018 based on lazard is 151 112 to 189 mwh this compares with 43 29 to 56 mwh for onshore wind and 41 36 to 46 mwh for utility scale solar pv from the same source this nuclear lcoe is an underestimate for several reasons first lazard assumes a construction time for nuclear of 5 75 years however the vogtle 3 and 4 reactors though will take at least 8 5 to 9 years to finish construction this additional delay alone results in an estimated lcoe for nuclear of about 172 128 to 215 mwh or a cost 2 3 to 7 4 times that of an onshore wind farm or utility pv farm next the lcoe does not include the cost of the major nuclear meltdowns in history for example the estimated cost to clean up the damage from three fukushima dai ichi nuclear reactor core meltdowns was 460 to 640 billion this is 1 2 billion or 10 to 18 5 percent of the capital cost of every nuclear reactor worldwide in addition the lcoe does not include the cost of storing nuclear waste for hundreds of thousands of years in the u s alone about 500 million is spent yearly to safeguard nuclear waste from about 100 civilian nuclear energy plants this amount will only increase as waste continues to accumulate after the plants retire the spending must continue for hundreds of thousands of years with no revenue stream from electricity sales to pay for the storage 3 weapons proliferation risk the growth of nuclear energy has historically increased the ability of nations to obtain or harvest plutonium or enrich uranium to manufacture nuclear weapons the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recognizes this fact they concluded in the executive summary of their 2014 report on energy with robust evidence and high agreement that nuclear weapons proliferation concern is a barrier and risk to the increasing development of nuclear energy barriers to and risks associated with an increasing use of nuclear energy include operational risks and the associated safety concerns uranium mining risks financial and regulatory risks unresolved waste management issues nuclear weapons proliferation concerns and adverse public opinion the building of a nuclear reactor for energy in a country that does not currently have a reactor allows the country to import uranium for use in the nuclear energy facility if the country so chooses it can secretly enrich the uranium to create weapons grade uranium and harvest plutonium from uranium fuel rods for use in nuclear weapons this does not mean any or every country will do this but historically some have and the risk is high as noted by ipcc the building and spreading of small modular reactors smrs may increase this risk further creative commons wikimedia 4 meltdown risk to date 1 5 of all nuclear power plants ever built have melted down to some degree meltdowns have been either catastrophic chernobyl russia in 1986 three reactors at fukushima dai ichi japan in 2011 or damaging three mile island pennsylvania in 1979 saint laurent france in 1980 the nuclear industry has proposed new reactor designs that they suggest are safer however these designs are generally untested and there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed built and operated correctly or that a natural disaster or act of terrorism such as an airplane flown into a reactor will not cause the reactor to fail resulting in a major disaster 5 mining lung cancer risk uranium mining causes lung cancer in large numbers of miners because uranium mines contain natural radon gas some of whose decay products are carcinogenic a study of 4 000 uranium miners between 1950 and 2000 found that 405 10 percent died of lung cancer a rate six times that expected based on smoking rates alone 61 others died of mining related lung diseases clean renewable energy does not have this risk because a it does not require the continuous mining of any material only one time mining to produce the energy generators and b the mining does not carry the same lung cancer risk that uranium mining does 6 carbon equivalent emissions and air pollution there is no such thing as a zero or close to zero emission nuclear power plant even existing plants emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant emissions from new nuclear are 78 to 178 g co2 kwh not close to 0 of this 64 to 102 g co2 kwh over 100 years are emissions from the background grid while consumers wait 10 to 19 years for nuclear to come online or be refurbished relative to 2 to 5 years for wind or solar in addition all nuclear plants emit 4 4 g co2e kwh from the water vapor and heat they release this contrasts with solar panels and wind turbines which reduce heat or water vapor fluxes to the air by about 2 2 g co2e kwh for a net difference from this factor alone of 6 6 g co2e kwh in fact china s investment in nuclear plants that take so long between planning and operation instead of wind or solar resulted in china s co2 emissions increasing 1 3 percent from 2016 to 2017 rather than declining by an estimated average of 3 percent the resulting difference in air pollution emissions may have caused 69 000 additional air pollution deaths in china in 2016 alone with additional deaths in years prior and since pexels commons 7 waste risk last but not least consumed fuel rods from nuclear plants are radioactive waste most fuel rods are stored at the same site as the reactor that consumed them this has given rise to hundreds of radioactive waste sites in many countries that must be maintained and funded for at least 200 000 years far beyond the lifetimes of any nuclear power plant the more nuclear waste that accumulates the greater the risk of radioactive leaks which can damage water supply crops animals and humans summary to recap new nuclear power costs about 5 times more than onshore wind power per kwh between 2 3 to 7 4 times depending upon location and integration issues nuclear takes 5 to 17 years longer between planning and operation and produces on average 23 times the emissions per unit electricity generated between 9 to 37 times depending upon plant size and construction schedule in addition it creates risk and cost associated with weapons proliferation meltdown mining lung cancer and waste risks clean renewables avoid all such risks nuclear advocates claim nuclear is still needed because renewables are intermittent and need natural gas for backup however nuclear itself never matches power demand so it needs backup even in france with one of the most advanced nuclear energy programs the maximum ramp rate is 1 to 5 per minute which means they need natural gas hydropower or batteries which ramp up 5 to 100 times faster to meet peaks in demand today in fact batteries are beating natural gas for wind and solar backup needs throughout the world a dozen independent scientific groups have further found that it is possible to match intermittent power demand with clean renewable energy supply and storage without nuclear at low cost finally many existing nuclear plants are so costly that their owners are demanding subsidies to stay open for example in 2016 three existing upstate new york nuclear plants requested and received subsidies to stay open using the argument that the plants were needed to keep emissions low however subsidizing such plants may increase carbon emissions and costs relative to replacing the plants with wind or solar as soon as possible thus subsidizing nuclear would result in higher emissions and costs over the long term than replacing nuclear with renewables derivations and sources of the numbers provided herein can be found here nuclear power is not the answer in a time of climate change aeon by heidi hutner stony brook university erica cirino science photojournalist and editor pam weintraub may 28 2019 in november 2018 the woolsey fire scorched nearly 100 000 acres of los angeles and ventura counties destroying forests fields and more than 1 500 structures and forcing the evacuation of nearly 300 000 people over 14 days it burned so viciously that it seared a scar into the land that s visible from space investigators determined that the woolsey fire began at the santa susana field laboratory a nuclear research property contaminated by a partial meltdown in 1959 of its failed sodium reactor experiment as well as rocket tests and regular releases of radiation the state of california s department of toxic substances control dtsc reports that its air ash and soil tests conducted on the property after the fire show no release of radiation beyond baseline for the contaminated site but the dtsc report lacks sufficient information according to the bulletin of atomic scientists it includes few actual measurements of the smoke from the fire and the data raises alarms research on chernobyl in ukraine following wildfires in 2015 shows clear release of radiation from the old nuclear power plant calling into question the quality of dtsc s tests what s more scientists such as nikolaos evangeliou who studies radiation releases from wildfires at the norwegian institute for air research point out that the same hot dry and windy conditions exacerbating the woolsey fire all related to human caused global warming are a precursor to future climate related radioactive releases with our climate impacted world now highly prone to fires extreme storms and sea level rise nuclear energy is touted as a possible replacement for the burning of fossil fuels for energy the leading cause of climate change nuclear power can demonstrably reduce carbon dioxide emissions yet scientific evidence and recent catastrophes call into question whether nuclear power could function safely in our warming world wild weather fires rising sea levels earthquakes and warming water temperatures all increase the risk of nuclear accidents while the lack of safe long term storage for radioactive waste remains a persistent danger the santa susana field laboratory property has had a long history of contaminated soil and groundwater indeed a 2006 advisory panel compiled a report suggesting that workers at the lab as well as residents living nearby had unusually high exposure to radiation and industrial chemicals that are linked to an increased incidence of some cancers discovery of the pollution prompted california s dtsc in 2010 to order a cleanup of the site by its current owner boeing with assistance from the us department of energy and nasa but the required cleanup has been hampered by boeing s legal fight to perform a less rigorous cleaning like the santa susana field lab chernobyl remains largely unremediated since its meltdown in 1986 with each passing year dead plant material accumulates and temperatures rise making it especially prone to fires in the era of climate change radiation releases from contaminated soils and forests can be carried thousands of kilometres away to human population centres according to evangeliou kate brown a historian at the massachusetts institute of technology and the author of manual for survival a chernobyl guide to the future 2019 and tim mousseau an evolutionary biologist at the university of south carolina also have grave concerns about forest fires records show that there have been fires in the chernobyl zone that raised the radiation levels by seven to 10 times since 1990 brown says further north melting glaciers contain radioactive fallout from global nuclear testing and nuclear accidents at levels 10 times higher than elsewhere as ice melts radioactive runoff flows into the ocean is absorbed into the atmosphere and falls as acid rain with fires and melting ice we are basically paying back a debt of radioactive debris incurred during the frenzied production of nuclear byproducts during the 20th century brown concludes flooding is another symptom of our warming world that could lead to nuclear disaster many nuclear plants are built on coastlines where seawater is easily used as a coolant sea level rise shoreline erosion coastal storms and heat waves all potentially catastrophic phenomena associated with climate change are expected to get more frequent as the earth continues to warm threatening greater damage to coastal nuclear power plants mere absence of greenhouse gas emissions is not sufficient to assess nuclear power as a mitigation for climate change conclude natalie kopytko and john perkins in their paper climate change nuclear power and the adaptation mitigation dilemma 2011 in energy policy proponents of nuclear power say that the reactors relative reliability and capacity make this a much clearer choice than other non fossil fuel sources of energy such as wind and solar which are sometimes brought offline by fluctuations in natural resource availability yet no one denies that older nuclear plants with an aged infrastructure often surpassing expected lifetimes are extremely inefficient and run a higher risk of disaster the primary source of nuclear power going forward will be the current nuclear fleet of old plants said joseph lassiter an energy expert and nuclear proponent who is retired from harvard university but even where public support exists for nuclear plants it remains to be seen if these new build nuclear plants will make a significant contribution to fossil emissions reductions given the cost and schedule overruns that have plagued the industry lassiter and several other energy experts advocate for the new generation iv nuclear power plants that are supposedly designed to deliver high levels of nuclear power at the lowest cost and with the lowest safety risks but other experts say that the benefits even here remain unclear the biggest critique of the generation iv nuclear reactors is that they are in the design phase and we don t have time to wait for their implementation climate abatement action is needed immediately new nuclear power seemingly represents an opportunity for solving global warming air pollution and energy security says mark jacobson director of stanford university s atmosphere and energy programme but it makes no economic or energy sense every dollar spent on nuclear results in one fifth the energy one would gain with wind or solar and nuclear energy takes five to 17 years longer before it becomes available as such it is impossible for nuclear to help with climate goals of reducing 80 per cent of emissions by 2030 also while we re waiting around for nuclear coal gas and oil are being burned and polluting the air in addition nuclear has energy security risks other technologies don t have weapons proliferation meltdown waste and uranium worker lung cancer risks around the world 31 countries have nuclear power plants that are currently online according to the international atomic energy agency by contrast four countries have made moves to phase out nuclear power following the 2011 fukushima disaster and 15 countries have remained opposed and have no functional power plants with almost all countries carbon dioxide emissions increasing and china india and the us leading the pack the small scandinavian country of denmark is an outlier its carbon dioxide emissions are decreasing despite it not producing any nuclear power denmark does import some nuclear power produced by its neighbours sweden and germany but in february the country s most left leaning political party enhedslisten published a new climate plan that outlines a path for the country to start relying on its own 100 per cent renewable non nuclear energy for power and heat production by 2030 the plan would require investments in renewables such as solar and wind a smart grid and electric vehicles that double as mobile batteries and can recharge the grid during peak hours gregory jaczko former chairman of the us nuclear regulatory commission and the author of confessions of a rogue nuclear regulator 2019 believes the technology is no longer a viable method for dealing with climate change it is dangerous costly and unreliable and abandoning it will not bring on a climate crisis see also bulletin of atomic

the overhaul of the federal tax law in 2017 was the signature legislative achievement of donald trump s presidency the biggest change to the tax code in three decades the law slashed taxes for big companies part of an effort to coax them to invest more in the united states and to discourage them from stashing profits in overseas tax havens corporate executives major investors and the wealthiest americans hailed the tax cuts as a once in a generation boon not only to their own fortunes but also to the u s economy but big companies wanted more and not long after the bill became law in december 2017 the trump administration began transforming the tax package into a greater windfall for the world s largest corporations and their shareholders the tax bills of many big companies have ended up even smaller than what was anticipated when the president signed the bill one consequence is that the federal government may collect hundreds of billions of dollars less over the coming decade than previously projected the budget deficit has jumped more than 50 since trump took office and is expected to top 1 trillion in 2020 partly as a result of the tax law laws like the 2017 tax cuts are carried out by federal agencies that first must formalize them via rules and regulations the process of writing the rules conducted largely out of public view can determine who wins and who loses starting in early 2018 senior officials in trump s treasury department were swarmed by lobbyists seeking to insulate companies from the few parts of the tax law that would have required them to pay more the crush of meetings was so intense that some top treasury officials had little time to do their jobs according to two people familiar with the process the lobbyists targeted a pair of major new taxes that were supposed to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from companies that had been avoiding taxes in part by claiming their profits were earned outside the united states the blitz was led by a cross section of the world s largest companies including anheuser busch credit suisse general electric united technologies barclays coca cola bank of america ubs ibm kraft heinz kimberly clark news corporation chubb conocophillips hsbc and the american international group thanks in part to the chaotic manner in which the bill was rushed through congress a situation that gave the treasury department extra latitude to interpret a law that was by all accounts sloppily written the corporate lobbying campaign was a resounding success through a series of obscure regulations the treasury carved out exceptions to the law that mean many leading american and foreign companies will owe little or nothing in new taxes on offshore profits according to a review of the treasury s rules government lobbying records and interviews with federal policymakers and tax experts companies were effectively let off the hook for tens if not hundreds of billions of taxes that they would have been required to pay treasury is gutting the new law said bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston it is largely the top 1 that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world it is the latest example of the benefits of the republican tax package flowing disproportionately to the richest of the rich even a tax break that was supposed to aid poor communities an initiative called opportunity zones is being used in part to finance high end developments in affluent neighborhoods at times benefiting those with ties to the trump administration of course companies didn t get everything they wanted and brian morgenstern a treasury spokesman defended the department s handling of the tax rules no particular taxpayer or group had any undue influence at any time in the process he said racing for a win ever since the birth of the modern federal income tax in 1913 companies have been concocting ways to avoid it in the late 1990s american companies accelerated their efforts to claim that trillions of dollars of profits they earned in high tax places like the united states japan or germany were actually earned in low or no tax places like luxembourg bermuda or ireland google apple cisco pfizer merck coca cola facebook and many others have deployed elaborate techniques that let the companies pay taxes at far less than the 35 corporate tax rate in the united states that existed before the 2017 changes their playful nicknames like double irish and dutch sandwich made them sound benign the obama administration and lawmakers from both parties have tried to combat this profit shifting but their efforts mostly stalled when trump and congressional republicans assembled an enormous tax cut package in 2017 they pitched it in part as a grand bargain companies would get the deep tax cuts that they had spent years clamoring for but the law would also represent a long overdue effort to fight corporate tax avoidance and the shipment of jobs overseas the situation where companies are actually encouraged to move overseas and keep their profits overseas makes no sense sen rob portman r ohio said on the senate floor in november 2017 republicans were racing to secure a legislative victory during trump s first year in office a period marked by the administration s failure to repeal obamacare and an embarrassing procession of political blunders sweeping tax cuts could give republicans a jolt of much needed momentum heading into the 2018 midterm elections to speed things along republicans used a congressional process known as budget reconciliation which blocked democrats from filibustering and allowed republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority but to qualify for that parliamentary green light the net cost of the bill after accounting for different tax cuts and tax increases had to be less than 1 5 trillion over 10 years the bill s cuts totaled 5 5 trillion the corporate income tax rate shrank to 21 from 35 and companies also won a tax break on the trillions in profits brought home from offshore to close the gap between the 5 5 trillion in cuts and the maximum price tag of 1 5 trillion the package sought to raise new revenue by eliminating deductions and introducing new taxes shifting money two of the biggest new taxes were supposed to apply to multinational corporations and lawmakers bestowed them with easy to pronounce acronyms beat and gilti that belie their complexity beat stands for the base erosion and anti abuse tax it was aimed largely at foreign companies with major operations in the united states some of which had for years minimized their u s tax bills by shifting money between american subsidiaries and their foreign parent companies instead of paying taxes in the united states companies send the profits to countries with lower tax rates the beat aimed to make that less lucrative some payments that companies sent to their foreign affiliates would face a new 10 tax the other big measure was called gilti global intangible low taxed income to reduce the benefit companies reaped by claiming that their profits were earned in tax havens the law imposed an additional tax of up to 10 5 on some offshore earnings the joint committee on taxation the congressional panel that estimates the impacts of tax changes predicted that the beat and gilti would bring in 262 billion over a decade roughly enough to fund the treasury department the environmental protection agency and the national cancer institute for 10 years sitting in the oval office on dec 22 2017 trump signed the tax cuts into law it was and remains the president s most significant legislative achievement built in loopholes from the start the new taxes were pocked with loopholes in the beat for example senate republicans hoped to avoid a revolt by large companies they wrote the law so that any payments an american company made to a foreign affiliate for something that went into a product as opposed to say interest payments on loans were excluded from the tax let s say an american pharmaceutical company sells pills in the united states the pills are manufactured by a subsidiary in ireland and the american parent pays the irish unit for the pills before they are sold to the public those payments mean that the company s profits in the united states where taxes are relatively high go down profits in tax friendly ireland go up because such payments to ireland wouldn t be taxed some companies that had been the most aggressive at shifting profits into offshore havens were spared the full brunt of the beat other companies like general electric were surprised to be hit by the new tax thinking it applied only to foreign multinationals according to pat brown who had been ge s top tax expert brown now the head of international tax policy at the accounting and consulting firm pwc said on a podcast this year that the trump administration should bridge the gap between expectations about the tax law and how it was playing out in reality he lobbied the treasury on behalf of ge the question he said is how creative and how expansive is treasury and the irs able to be an exhaustive lobbying campaign almost immediately after trump signed the bill companies and their lobbyists including ge s brown began a full court pressure campaign to try to shield themselves from the beat and gilti the treasury department had to figure out how to carry out the hastily written law which lacked crucial details chip harter was the treasury official in charge of writing the rules for the beat and gilti he had spent decades at pwc and the law firm baker mckenzie counseling companies on the same sorts of tax avoidance arrangements that the new law was supposed to discourage starting in january 2018 he and his colleagues found themselves in nonstop meetings roughly 10 a week at times with lobbyists for companies and industry groups the organization for international investment a powerful trade group for foreign multinationals like swiss food company nestlé and dutch chemical maker lyondellbasell objected to a treasury proposal that would have prevented companies from using a complex currency accounting maneuver to avoid the beat the group s lobbyists were from pwc and baker mckenzie harter s former firms according to public lobbying disclosures one of them pam olson was the top treasury tax official in the george w bush administration morgenstern the treasury spokesman said harter didn t meet with pwc while the rules were being written this month the treasury issued the final version of some of the beat regulations the organization for international investment got what it wanted helping foreign banks one of the most effective campaigns with the greatest financial consequence was led by a small group of large foreign banks including credit suisse and barclays u s regulators require international banks to ensure that their united states divisions are financially equipped to absorb big losses in a crisis to meet those requirements foreign banks lend the money to their american outposts those loans accrue interest under the beat the interest that the american units paid to their european parents would often be taxed foreign banks should not be penalized by the u s tax laws for complying with regulations said briget polichene chief executive of the institute of international bankers whose members include many of the world s largest banks banks flooded the treasury department with lobbyists and letters late last year harter went to treasury secretary steven mnuchin and told him about the plan to give the banks a break mnuchin a longtime banking executive before joining the trump administration signed off on the new exemptions according to a person familiar with the matter a few months later the tax policy office handed another victory to the foreign banks ruling that an even wider range of bank payments would be exempted among the lobbyists who successfully pushed the banks case in private meetings with senior treasury officials was erika nijenhuis of the law firm cleary gottlieb her client was the institute of international bankers in september 2019 nijenhuis took off her lobbying hat and joined the treasury s office of tax policy which was still writing the rules governing the tax law some tax experts said that the treasury had no legal authority to exempt the bank payments from the beat only congress had that power the trump administration created the exception out of whole cloth said wells the university of houston professor even inside the treasury the ruling was controversial some officials told harter the senior official in charge of the international rules that the department lacked the power according to people familiar with the discussions harter dismissed the objections officials at the joint committee on taxation have calculated that the exemptions for international banks could reduce by up to 50 billion the revenue raised by the beat overall the beat is likely to collect a small fraction of the 150 billion of new tax revenue that was originally projected by congress said thomas horst who advises companies on their overseas tax arrangements he came to that conclusion after reviewing the tax disclosures in more than 140 annual reports filed by multinationals morgenstern the treasury spokesman said we thoroughly reviewed these issues internally and are fully comfortable that we have the legal authority for the conclusions reached in these regulations he said nijenhuis was not involved in crafting the beat rules he also said the treasury decided that changing the rules for foreign banks was appropriate we were responsive to job creators he said heading to the hill the lobbying surrounding the gilti was equally intense and once again large companies won valuable concessions back in 2017 republicans said the gilti was meant to prevent companies from avoiding american taxes by moving their intellectual property overseas in the pharmaceutical and tech industries in particular profits are often tied to patents companies had sold the rights to their patents to subsidiaries in offshore tax havens the companies then imposed steep licensing fees on their american units the sleight of hand transactions reduced profits in the united states and left them in places like bermuda and the british virgin islands but after the law was enacted large multinationals in industries like consumer products discovered that the gilti tax applied to them too that threatened to cut into their windfalls from the corporate tax rate s falling to 21 from 35 lobbyists for procter gamble and other companies turned to lawmakers for help they asked members of the senate finance committee to tell treasury officials that they hadn t intended the gilti to affect their industries it was a simple but powerful strategy because the treasury was required to consider congressional intent when writing the tax rules such explanations could sway the outcome several senators then met with mnuchin to discuss the rules one lobbyist michael caballero had been a senior treasury official in the obama administration his clients included credit suisse and industrial conglomerate united technologies he met repeatedly with treasury and white house officials and pushed them to modify the rules so that big companies hit by the gilti wouldn t lose certain tax deductions in essence the high tax exception that caballero was proposing would allow companies to deduct expenses that they incurred in their overseas operations from their american profits lowering their u s tax bills other companies jumped on the bandwagon news corp liberty mutual anheuser busch comcast and p g wrote letters or dispatched lobbyists to argue for the high tax exception after months of meetings with lobbyists the treasury announced in june 2019 that it was creating a version of the exception that the companies had sought an implied threat two years after the tax cuts became law their impact is becoming clear companies continue to shift hundreds of billions of dollars to overseas tax havens ensuring that huge sums of corporate profits remain out of reach of the u s government the internal revenue service is collecting tens of billions of dollars less in corporate taxes than congress projected inflating the tax law s 13 figure price tag this month the organization for economic cooperation and development calculated that the united states in 2018 experienced the largest drop in tax revenue of any of the group s 36 member countries the united states also had by far the largest budget deficit of any of those countries in the coming days the treasury is likely to complete its last round of rules carrying out the tax cuts big companies have spent this fall trying to win more in september chris d trunck the vice president for tax at owens corning the maker of insulation and roofing materials wrote to the irs he pushed the treasury to tinker with the gilti rules in a way that would preserve hundreds of millions of dollars of tax benefits that owens corning had accumulated from settling claims that it poisoned employees and others with asbestos the same month underwear manufacturer hanes sent its own letter to mnuchin the letter from bryant purvis hanes vice president of global tax urged mnuchin to broaden the high tax exception so that more companies could take advantage of it otherwise purvis warned the gilti regime will become an impediment to u s companies and their ability to not only compete globally as a general matter but also their ability to remain u s headquartered if they are to maintain the overall fiscal health of their business the implied threat was clear if the treasury didn t further chip away at the new tax companies like hanes based in winston salem north carolina might have no choice but to move their headquarters overseas c 2019 the new york times company

absorb big losses in a crisis to meet those requirements foreign banks lend the money to their american outposts those loans accrue interest under the beat the interest that the american units paid to their european parents would often be taxed foreign banks should not be penalized by the u s tax laws for complying with regulations said briget polichene chief executive of the institute of international bankers whose members include many of the world s largest banks banks flooded the treasury department with lobbyists and letters late last year harter went to treasury secretary steven mnuchin and told him about the plan to give the banks a break mnuchin a longtime banking executive before joining the trump administration signed off on the new exemptions according to a person familiar with the matter a few months later the tax policy office handed another victory to the foreign banks ruling that an even wider range of bank payments would be exempted among the lobbyists who successfully pushed the banks case in private meetings with senior treasury officials was erika nijenhuis of the law firm cleary gottlieb her client was the institute of international bankers in september 2019 nijenhuis took off her lobbying hat and joined the treasury s office of tax policy which was still writing the rules governing the tax law some tax experts said that the treasury had no legal authority to exempt the bank payments from the beat only congress had that power the trump administration created the exception out of whole cloth said wells the university of houston professor even inside the treasury the ruling was controversial some officials told harter the senior official in charge of the international rules that the department lacked the power according to people familiar with the discussions harter dismissed the objections officials at the joint committee on taxation have calculated that the exemptions for international banks could reduce by up to 50 billion the revenue raised by the beat overall the beat is likely to collect a small fraction of the 150 billion of new tax revenue that was originally projected by congress said thomas horst who advises companies on their overseas tax arrangements he came to that conclusion after reviewing the tax disclosures in more than 140 annual reports filed by multinationals morgenstern the treasury spokesman said we thoroughly reviewed these issues internally and are fully comfortable that we have the legal authority for the conclusions reached in these regulations he said nijenhuis was not involved in crafting the beat rules he also said the treasury decided that changing the rules for foreign banks was appropriate we were responsive to job creators he said heading to the hill the lobbying surrounding the gilti was equally intense and once again large companies won valuable concessions back in 2017 republicans said the gilti was meant to prevent companies from avoiding american taxes by moving their intellectual property overseas in the pharmaceutical and tech industries in particular profits are often tied to patents companies had sold the rights to their patents to subsidiaries in offshore tax havens the companies then imposed steep licensing fees on their american units the sleight of hand transactions reduced profits in the united states and left them in places like bermuda and the british virgin islands but after the law was enacted large multinationals in industries like consumer products discovered that the gilti tax applied to them too that threatened to cut into their windfalls from the corporate tax rate s falling to 21 from 35 lobbyists for procter gamble and other companies turned to lawmakers for help they asked members of the senate finance committee to tell treasury officials that they hadn t intended the gilti to affect their industries it was a simple but powerful strategy because the treasury was required to consider congressional intent when writing the tax rules such explanations could sway the outcome several senators then met with mnuchin to discuss the rules one lobbyist michael caballero had been a senior treasury official in the obama administration his clients included credit suisse and industrial conglomerate united technologies he met repeatedly with treasury and white house officials and pushed them to modify the rules so that big companies hit by the gilti wouldn t lose certain tax deductions in essence the high tax exception that caballero was proposing would allow companies to deduct expenses that they incurred in their overseas operations from their american profits lowering their u s tax bills other companies jumped on the bandwagon news corp liberty mutual anheuser busch comcast and p g wrote letters or dispatched lobbyists to argue for the high tax exception after months of meetings with lobbyists the treasury announced in june 2019 that it was creating a version of the exception that the companies

mnuchin and told him about the plan to give the banks a break mnuchin a longtime banking executive before joining the trump administration signed off on the new exemptions according to a person familiar with the matter a few months later the tax policy office handed another victory to the foreign banks ruling that an even wider range of bank payments would be exempted among the lobbyists who successfully pushed the banks case in private meetings with senior treasury officials was erika nijenhuis of the law firm cleary gottlieb her client was the institute of international bankers in september 2019 nijenhuis took off her lobbying hat and joined the treasury s office of tax policy which was still writing the rules governing the tax law some tax experts said that the treasury had no legal authority to exempt the bank payments from the beat only congress had that power the trump administration created the exception out of whole cloth said wells the university of houston professor even inside the treasury the ruling was controversial some officials told harter the senior official in charge of the international rules that the department lacked the power according to people familiar with the discussions harter dismissed the objections officials at the joint committee on taxation have calculated that the exemptions for international banks could reduce by up to 50 billion the revenue raised by the beat overall the beat is likely to collect a small fraction of the 150 billion of new tax revenue that was originally projected by congress said thomas horst who advises companies on their overseas tax arrangements he came to that conclusion after reviewing the tax disclosures in more than 140 annual reports filed by multinationals morgenstern the treasury spokesman said we thoroughly reviewed these issues internally and are fully comfortable that we have the legal authority for the conclusions reached in these regulations he said nijenhuis was not involved in crafting the beat rules he also said the treasury decided that changing the rules for foreign banks was appropriate we were responsive to job creators he said heading to the hill the lobbying surrounding the gilti was equally intense and once again large companies won valuable concessions back in 2017 republicans said the gilti was meant to prevent companies from avoiding american taxes by moving their intellectual property overseas in the pharmaceutical and tech industries in particular profits are often tied to patents companies had sold the rights to their patents to subsidiaries in offshore tax havens the companies then imposed steep licensing fees on their american units the sleight of hand transactions reduced profits in the united states and left them in places like bermuda and the british virgin islands but after the law was enacted large multinationals in industries like consumer products discovered that the gilti tax applied to them too that threatened to cut into their windfalls from the corporate tax rate s falling to 21 from 35 lobbyists for procter gamble and other companies turned to lawmakers for help they asked members of the senate finance committee to tell treasury officials that they hadn t intended the gilti to affect their industries it was a simple but powerful strategy because the treasury was required to consider congressional intent when writing the tax rules such explanations could sway the outcome several senators then met with mnuchin to discuss the rules one lobbyist michael caballero had been a senior treasury official in the obama administration his clients included credit suisse and industrial conglomerate united technologies he met repeatedly with treasury and white house officials and pushed them to modify the rules so that big companies hit by the gilti wouldn t lose certain tax deductions in essence the high tax exception that caballero was proposing would allow companies to deduct expenses that they incurred in their overseas operations from their american profits lowering their u s tax bills other companies jumped on the bandwagon news corp liberty mutual anheuser busch comcast and p g wrote letters or dispatched lobbyists to argue for the high tax exception after months of meetings with lobbyists the treasury announced in june 2019 that it was creating a version of the exception that the companies had sought an implied threat two years after the tax cuts became law their impact is becoming clear companies continue to shift hundreds of billions of dollars to overseas tax havens ensuring that huge sums of corporate profits remain out of reach of the u s government the internal revenue service is collecting tens of billions of dollars less in corporate taxes than congress projected inflating the tax law s 13 figure price tag this month the organization for economic cooperation and development calculated that the united states in 2018 experienced the largest drop in tax revenue of any of the group s 36 member countries the united states also had by far the largest budget deficit of any of those countries in the coming days the treasury is likely to complete its last round of rules carrying out the tax cuts big companies have spent this fall trying to win more in september chris d trunck the vice president for tax at owens corning the maker of insulation and roofing materials wrote to the irs he pushed the treasury to tinker with the gilti rules in a way that would preserve hundreds of millions of dollars of tax benefits that owens corning had accumulated from settling claims that it poisoned employees and others with asbestos the same month underwear manufacturer hanes sent its own letter to mnuchin the letter from bryant purvis hanes vice president of global tax urged mnuchin to broaden the high tax exception so that more companies could take advantage of it otherwise purvis warned the gilti regime will become an impediment to u s companies and their ability to not only compete globally as a general matter but also their ability to remain u s headquartered if they are to maintain the overall fiscal health of their business the implied threat was clear if the treasury didn t further chip away at the new tax companies like hanes based in winston salem north carolina might have no choice but to move their headquarters overseas c 2019 the new

open this photo in gallery the tax bills of many big companies ended up even smaller than what was anticipated when president donald trump signed the bill that became the tax law in 2017 anna moneymaker the new york times news service the overhaul of the federal tax law in 2017 was the signature legislative achievement of donald trump s presidency the biggest change to the tax code in three decades the law slashed taxes for big companies part of an effort to coax them to invest more in the united states and to discourage them from stashing profits in overseas tax havens corporate executives major investors and the wealthiest americans hailed the tax cuts as a once in a generation boon not only to their own fortunes but also to the u s economy but big companies wanted more and not long after the bill became law in december 2017 the trump administration began transforming the tax package into a greater windfall for the world s largest corporations and their shareholders the tax bills of many big companies have ended up even smaller than what was anticipated when the president signed the bill one consequence is that the federal government may collect hundreds of billions of dollars less over the coming decade than previously projected the budget deficit has jumped more than 50 since trump took office and is expected to top 1 trillion in 2020 partly as a result of the tax law laws like the 2017 tax cuts are carried out by federal agencies that first must formalize them via rules and regulations the process of writing the rules conducted largely out of public view can determine who wins and who loses starting in early 2018 senior officials in trump s treasury department were swarmed by lobbyists seeking to insulate companies from the few parts of the tax law that would have required them to pay more the crush of meetings was so intense that some top treasury officials had little time to do their jobs according to two people familiar with the process the lobbyists targeted a pair of major new taxes that were supposed to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from companies that had been avoiding taxes in part by claiming their profits were earned outside the united states the blitz was led by a cross section of the world s largest companies including anheuser busch credit suisse general electric united technologies barclays coca cola bank of america ubs ibm kraft heinz kimberly clark news corporation chubb conocophillips hsbc and the american international group thanks in part to the chaotic manner in which the bill was rushed through congress a situation that gave the treasury department extra latitude to interpret a law that was by all accounts sloppily written the corporate lobbying campaign was a resounding success through a series of obscure regulations the treasury carved out exceptions to the law that mean many leading american and foreign companies will owe little or nothing in new taxes on offshore profits according to a review of the treasury s rules government lobbying records and interviews with federal policymakers and tax experts companies were effectively let off the hook for tens if not hundreds of billions of taxes that they would have been required to pay treasury is gutting the new law said bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston it is largely the top 1 that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world it is the latest example of the benefits of the republican tax package flowing disproportionately to the richest of the rich even a tax break that was supposed to aid poor communities an initiative called opportunity zones is being used in part to finance high end developments in affluent neighborhoods at times benefiting those with ties to the trump administration of course companies didn t get everything they wanted and brian morgenstern a treasury spokesman defended the department s handling of the tax rules no particular taxpayer or group had any undue influence at any time in the process he said racing for a win ever since the birth of the modern federal income tax in 1913 companies have been concocting ways to avoid it in the late 1990s american companies accelerated their efforts to claim that trillions of dollars of profits they earned in high tax places like the united states japan or germany were actually earned in low or no tax places like luxembourg bermuda or ireland google apple cisco pfizer merck coca cola facebook and many others have deployed elaborate techniques that let the companies pay taxes at far less than the 35 corporate tax rate in the united states that existed before the 2017 changes their playful nicknames like double irish and dutch sandwich made them sound benign the obama administration and lawmakers from both parties have tried to combat this profit shifting but their efforts mostly stalled when trump and congressional republicans assembled an enormous tax cut package in 2017 they pitched it in part as a grand bargain companies would get the deep tax cuts that they had spent years clamoring for but the law would also represent a long overdue effort to fight corporate tax avoidance and the shipment of jobs overseas the situation where companies are actually encouraged to move overseas and keep their profits overseas makes no sense sen rob portman r ohio said on the senate floor in november 2017 republicans were racing to secure a legislative victory during trump s first year in office a period marked by the administration s failure to repeal obamacare and an embarrassing procession of political blunders sweeping tax cuts could give republicans a jolt of much needed momentum heading into the 2018 midterm elections to speed things along republicans used a congressional process known as budget reconciliation which blocked democrats from filibustering and allowed republicans to pass the bill with a simple majority but to qualify for that parliamentary green light the net cost of the bill after accounting for different tax cuts and tax increases had to be less than 1 5 trillion over 10 years the bill s cuts totaled 5 5 trillion the corporate income tax rate shrank to 21 from 35 and companies also won a tax break on the trillions in profits brought home from offshore to close the gap between the 5 5 trillion in cuts and the maximum price tag of 1 5 trillion the package sought to raise new revenue by eliminating deductions and introducing new taxes shifting money two of the biggest new taxes were supposed to apply to multinational corporations and lawmakers bestowed them with easy to pronounce acronyms beat and gilti that belie their complexity beat stands for the base erosion and anti abuse tax it was aimed largely at foreign companies with major operations in the united states some of which had for years minimized their u s tax bills by shifting money between american subsidiaries and their foreign parent companies instead of paying taxes in the united states companies send the profits to countries with lower tax rates the beat aimed to make that less lucrative some payments that companies sent to their foreign affiliates would face a new 10 tax the other big measure was called gilti global intangible low taxed income to reduce the benefit companies reaped by claiming that their profits were earned in tax havens the law imposed an additional tax of up to 10 5 on some offshore earnings the joint committee on taxation the congressional panel that estimates the impacts of tax changes predicted that the beat and gilti would bring in 262 billion over a decade roughly enough to fund the treasury department the environmental protection agency and the national cancer institute for 10 years sitting in the oval office on dec 22 2017 trump signed the tax cuts into law it was and remains the president s most significant legislative achievement built in loopholes from the start the new taxes were pocked with loopholes in the beat for example senate republicans hoped to avoid a revolt by large companies they wrote the law so that any payments an american company made to a foreign affiliate for something that went into a product as opposed to say interest payments on loans were excluded from the tax let s say an american pharmaceutical company sells pills in the united states the pills are manufactured by a subsidiary in ireland and the american parent pays the irish unit for the pills before they are sold to the public those payments mean that the company s profits in the united states where taxes are relatively high go down profits in tax friendly ireland go up because such payments to ireland wouldn t be taxed some companies that had been the most aggressive at shifting profits into offshore havens were spared the full brunt of the beat the treasury department had to figure out how to carry out the hastily written law which lacked crucial details chip harter was the treasury official in charge of writing the rules for the beat and gilti he had spent decades at pwc and the law firm baker mckenzie counseling companies on the same sorts of tax avoidance arrangements that the new law was supposed to discourage starting in january 2018 he and his colleagues found themselves in nonstop meetings roughly 10 a week at times with lobbyists for companies and industry groups the organization for international investment a powerful trade group for foreign multinationals like swiss food company nestlé and dutch chemical maker lyondellbasell objected to a treasury proposal that would have prevented companies from using a complex currency accounting maneuver to avoid the beat the group s lobbyists were from pwc and baker mckenzie harter s former firms according to public lobbying disclosures one of them pam olson was the top treasury tax official in the george w bush administration morgenstern the treasury spokesman said harter didn t meet with pwc while the rules were being written this month the treasury issued the final version of some of the beat regulations the organization for international investment got what it wanted helping foreign banks one of the most effective campaigns with the greatest financial consequence was led by a small group of large foreign banks including credit suisse and barclays u s regulators require international banks to ensure that their united states divisions are financially equipped to absorb big losses in a crisis to meet those requirements foreign banks lend the money to their american outposts those loans accrue interest under the beat the interest that the american units paid to their european parents would often be taxed foreign banks should not be penalized by the u s tax laws for complying with regulations said briget polichene chief executive of the institute of international bankers whose members include many of the world s largest banks banks flooded the treasury department with lobbyists and letters late last year harter went to treasury secretary steven mnuchin and told him about the plan to give the banks a break mnuchin a longtime banking executive before joining the trump administration signed off on the new exemptions according to a person familiar with the matter a few months later the tax policy office handed another victory to the foreign banks ruling that an even wider range of bank payments would be exempted some tax experts said that the treasury had no legal authority to exempt the bank payments from the beat only congress had that power the trump administration created the exception out of whole cloth said wells the university of houston professor an implied threat two years after the tax cuts became law their impact is becoming clear companies continue to shift hundreds of billions of dollars to overseas tax havens ensuring that huge sums of corporate profits remain out of reach of the u s government the internal revenue service is collecting tens of billions of dollars less in corporate taxes than congress projected inflating the tax law s 13 figure price tag this month the organization for economic cooperation and development calculated that the united states in 2018 experienced the largest drop in tax revenue of any of the group s 36 member countries the united states also had by far the largest budget deficit of any of those countries in the coming days the treasury is likely to complete its last round of rules carrying out the tax cuts big companies have spent this fall trying to win more in september chris d trunck the vice president for tax at owens corning the maker of insulation and roofing materials wrote to the irs he pushed the treasury to tinker with the gilti rules in a way that would preserve hundreds of millions of dollars of tax benefits that owens corning had accumulated from settling claims that it poisoned employees and others with asbestos the same month underwear manufacturer hanes sent its own letter to mnuchin the letter from bryant purvis hanes vice president of global tax urged mnuchin to broaden the high tax exception so that more companies could take advantage of it otherwise purvis warned the gilti regime will become an impediment to u s companies and their ability to not only compete globally as a general matter but also their ability to remain u s headquartered if they are to maintain the overall fiscal health of their business the implied threat was clear if the treasury didn t further chip away at the new tax companies like hanes based in winston salem north carolina might have no choice but to move their headquarters overseas

washington dc after nearly 18 months of tit for tat tariff increases the united states and china have reached a phase one agreement to start de escalating their trade war as part of the deal us president donald trump cancelled further tariff increases on chinese goods that had been scheduled to take effect on december 15 and halved a 15 per cent tariff on 120 billion worth of imports from china as for china it shelved its planned retaliatory measures and committed to import some 50 billion worth of us agricultural products in each of the next two years but the promised de escalation should not be overestimated for starters it is not clear how china could follow through on its import commitment without violating the world trade organisation wto principle of non discrimination among trading partners moreover the 25 per cent us tariff on 250 billion of chinese imports remains in place with further reductions linked to progress in future trade negotiations in fact the current agreement addresses only some of the us government s trade related complaints against china and its remaining demands will be much more challenging to resolve broadly speaking the us wants the chinese authorities to take steps to eliminate their country s bilateral trade surplus with the us end currency manipulation cease intellectual property ip theft refrain from further forced technology transfer halt subsidies to state owned enterprises soes and stop acquisitions of us companies through state sponsored investment if this were a negotiation one might sensibly ask what the chinese authorities were seeking from the us in exchange for its steps in these areas but this is not a negotiation the trump administration is presenting china with a set of demands which if unmet will result in punishment there are three major problems with the american demands first some of them are conceptually erroneous second in a global trading system bilateral action often results only in a rearrangement of trading partners third it is not clear what the chinese government could do to satisfy some of the us demands for starters the demand that china eliminate its bilateral trade surplus with the us is misguided there is no reason why merchandise trade balances should matter at all for one thing services trade is equally important exporting financial services is almost certainly more economically rewarding than exporting coal for example moreover some countries offer many more worthwhile investment opportunities than others citizens in countries with less attractive opportunities benefit from buying assets where the return is higher and these investments are financed by current account imbalances even then bilateral balances are irrelevant the current account balance is the difference between domestic investment and domestic saving in the private and public sectors and the us deficit is global if one country reduces its surplus with america the us economy will simply adjust both imports and exports the us demand regarding currency manipulation reflects a similar fallacy the apparent intent is to reduce america s bilateral trade deficit with china but until the us savings investment balance changes that will not happen us law stipulates three criteria for identifying currency manipulation by a trading partner a global current account surplus of more than 3 per cent of gdp persistent intervention to buy foreign exchange and sell domestic currency and a bilateral trade surplus with the us of more than 20 billion because china currently meets only the third condition it is not a currency manipulator under us law that did not stop the trump administration from labeling the country one in august the other us objectives regarding ip theft technology transfer subsidies to soes and investment requirements can satisfactorily be addressed only at the multilateral level like any wto member the us can bring a complaint when it believes that a trading partner has not abided by wto rules which admittedly could be strengthened but the trump administration has filed only two cases against china despite the fact that the us had previously won 91 per cent of the cases it brought to the wto and even though the chinese authorities have a good track record of amending their practices when wto panels have ruled against them when wto rules do not cover a particular case members should seek to amend them moreover other major us trading partners notably canada the european union and japan have voiced many of the same trade concerns regarding china if the us joined forces with them they would have much greater bargaining power vis à vis china than america would have on its own but instead of using the wto the trump administration incredibly is undermining it by blocking the appointment of new judges to the organisation s dispute settlement body dsb the dsb should have seven appointed members of whom three must be on any panel hearing a case but because the us has consistently vetoed candidates to replace judges who have completed their terms the dsb now has only one member and thus can no longer function although the dsb certainly could be rendered more effective it has been very useful in settling disputes and preventing trade wars dismantling the entire process makes no sense finally even regarding valid us concerns there is no indication regarding what changes the chinese government should make to satisfy the trump administration it is in both america s and china s interest that the open multilateral global trading system prosper and support economic growth worldwide unfortunately there is little prospect that current american policy can achieve that goal anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former
