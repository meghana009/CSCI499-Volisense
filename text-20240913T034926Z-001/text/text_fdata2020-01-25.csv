this article appears in the december 30 2019 january 6 2020 issue almost immediately upon entering the white house in 2017 donald trump began a series of assaults on the existing global order which has lasted in its essentials since the end of world war ii in 1945 it seemed obvious to the architects of the postwar system that a broad network of international agreements was needed to avoid the virulent nationalism that so recently plunged the world into the bloodiest and most disastrous war in history organizations and accords like the united nations the world bank the international monetary fund the north atlantic treaty organization the european union the world trade organization and the north american free trade agreement and its more limited predecessor came into being declaring a policy of nationalism trump has launched verbal attacks on such international institutions threatening to pull out of many of them including the more recent paris climate agreement books in review empire of democracy the remaking of the west since the cold war 1971 2017 by simon reid henry buy this book underlying the postwar international order was a widespread belief that the spread of democratic institutions was the best way to prevent the recurrence of the war dictatorship and genocide that caused so much destruction between 1914 and 1945 and trump has attacked these too at home he has criticized the american judiciary and the american press while abroad he has cozied up to dictators and authoritarian strongmen like vladimir putin viktor orbán rodrigo duterte jair bolsonaro kim jong un and recep tayyip erdogan seldom do we hear professions emanating from the white house of america s leadership in support of peace democracy and international cooperation instead we usually hear threats of trade wars boasts of nuclear arsenals and slogans such as america first these are alarming developments but are there broader causes of what many commentators describe as the breakup of the west and the decline of the postwar international order what was and in fact what is the west and has it really ever promoted democratic values across the globe is it a concept that has had its day or is it still a useful tool for understanding the international order all these questions are raised in an often acute form in british geographer simon reid henry s massive new study empire of democracy the remaking of the west since the cold war 1971 2017 it leaves us in no doubt that what is happening in the united states is far from a new or isolated phenomenon in one country after another politics has become polarized and the center has been hollowed out democratic institutions have come under fire and right wing populists and demagogues have taken the reins of power the liberal values that have long held sway over the internal and external policies of many countries can no longer be taken for granted putin has announced that the liberal idea has become obsolete in the world it seems obvious that this situation is the result above all of the global financial crisis of 2008 09 but reid henry argues that it began long before the cold war came to an end with urban riots and widespread protests over the vietnam war in the united states with frequent labor conflicts in europe and with skyrocketing inflation in the wake of massive oil price hikes he says the west was already experiencing a serious challenge to the postwar liberal order four decades ago reid henry begins his narrative in the early 1970s in the aftermath of the student movements of 1968 and the challenge they posed along with the economic downturn that began in 1973 governments in europe and the united states struggled to find a way of bringing back economic prosperity and progress as the old industrial base of the advanced economies began to decline under the impact of the global energy crisis and rising competition from china in these years of economic and political uncertainty a new

too much for many planned economies and led to rapidly escalating economic and political bankruptcy in the west another solution was found in what was beginning to be called neoliberalism a loose set of doctrines taken up by parties of the right and center left that transformed social democracies into regimes defined by low taxation fiscal deregulation and a minimalist state neoliberalism triumphed over communism at the end of the 1980s according to reid henry and helped create the economic boom of the 1990s but he is quick to add neoliberalism also planted the seeds of the crisis that followed as the united states and its allies plunged deeper into economic inequality and pursued a series of disastrous and staggeringly expensive wars after 9 11 the deregulation of the financial system caught up with them financial institutions lent money with abandon to people who increasingly couldn t afford to pay it back and the global interconnectedness of investment and lending banks ensured that when one bank got into trouble over unpaid loans the crisis would spread with astonishing rapidity across the entire system current issue view our current issue when this finally came to pass in 2008 with banks crashing borrowers defaulting and businesses going bust the advanced industrial societies found themselves facing a sharp increase in unemployment still dominated by neoliberal dogma their governments proved unable to imagine any way to resolve their economic quandaries beyond imposing further cuts in state spending perhaps in another era this might have led to a resurgence of social democracy and the left but instead a new and unprecedented wave of right wing populism emerged including the tea party in the united states the brexit movement in the united kingdom the revitalized national front in france and the fidesz party in hungary the pent up frustration and self loathing under which a large portion of westerners had been toiling reid henry observes now found its outlet in the rise of the politics of resentment and extremism which drove western democracy into the deepest crisis in its history underpinned by prosperity and rising expectations neoliberalism was long able to gloss over its contradictions but in an age of economic crisis and widespread inequality it has shown itself to be singularly unsuited to withstand the challenges of the new order to survive reid henry argues modern liberal democracies urgently need to be reimagined empire of democracy gives us a detailed account of this story telling us how we got to where we are today and tracking the rise and fall of an economic social and political order that now seems to be under fundamental and potentially lethal pressure despite the convincing nature of his overall diagnosis of the strengths and weaknesses of neoliberalism however there are many problems with how reid henry tells this story starting with the narrative style in which he has chosen to cast it to put it bluntly he doesn t seem to be aware of even the most basic rules of historical narrative individual actors in the story from mitterrand to trump are introduced with only scant background information important dates are missing in dense chapters and statements and observations are ventured without any attempt to ground them in evidence for a more or less random example near the end of the book we are told that dodd frank had belatedly been passed in 2011 along with its famous volcker rule you have to read back more than 60 pages for any explanation as to what these things are at roughly that time reid henry tells us on the very same page amplified by the extended reach of new media the culture wars leapt back into life as never before as tirades blared out across the raucous and indiscriminating airwaves of shock jock radio and fox television he makes no attempt to unpack this sentence simply assuming that readers will understand the references but it s not a safe assumption to make and terms such as culture wars and shock jock radio really do need to be explained for the uninitiated there are more substantive problems as well for quite long stretches of the book i found it difficult to understand the sweeping generalizations that pepper the text for instance what was the distinctive sense of ennui that had haunted the western democracies during the 1990s among whom bored with what americans in particular we read a couple of pages earlier found themselves in a confusing place all americans and what place they were concerned about growing inequity the text continues but we aren t told how or why or which americans were concerned or in what way similar generalizations occur about other peoples such as the french who apparently felt that they were immune from the troubles that had struck the united states because their banking system was more prudent actually most likely the vast majority of the french neither knew nor cared very much about their banking system prudent or not later we are told that a declining sense of trust within society in the early 21st century meant that left and right now converged upon a resolutely anti state ethos leaving aside the question of precisely which countries this applies to one can think of myriad issues where this is simply untrue from the introduction of the sure start program in the uk in 1998 to the british left s growing demand for the renationalization of private utilities including the railways now part of the official program of the labour party to the pressure exerted in the us by the right for the expansion of the state security apparatus in the war against terror and the persistent advocacy by republicans of more state expenditure on the military often reid henry s use of the passive voice disguises an almost complete absence of detail the balance between freedom and democracy that western liberal democracies had struggled for forty years to maintain was now rejected altogether what is the evidence for this struggle why should freedom and democracy be treated as opposites between which a balance needed to be maintained and was this balance actually rejected by everyone or if only partially rejected or not rejected at all then by whom and when and where it s not even true of poland and hungary where substantial forces remain in opposition to the right wing nationalists currently in power in many sections the book reads more like a commentary on events than an analytical narrative the description of the election that put barack obama in the white house is a good example there are some interesting observations on sarah palin but we re not told what public office she held before becoming a candidate for the vice presidency the tea party is brought into the narrative but we re apparently expected to know what it was who helped launch it and what policies it advocated and no statistics are provided for the election to indicate how many people voted for obama and who they were the nature of obama s appeal is also largely left unexplored his powerful catchphrase yes we can isn t even mentioned and running throughout the book is also the highly dubious assumption that street politics exercise a profound effect on political systems from the anti vietnam war movement which the author tells us inaugurated the remaking of the west in the early 1970s to the occupy movement which flared up briefly in 2011 and is now almost completely forgotten yet the more than 1 million people who marched through the streets of london on february 15 2003 to protest the impending invasion of iraq achieved precisely nothing nor did the similar number of people who marched through the same streets on march 23 2019 to demand that britain remain in the european union there are still many passages in this book that can be read with considerable profit the account of the 2008 09 financial crisis is particularly perceptive and one could mention many other examples but there is a more fundamental and perhaps more interesting respect in which the book rests on a highly questionable assumption chief among these is the concept of the west itself and its linkage with liberalism and democracy empire of democracy falls into a long tradition of historical writing centered on predictions of the downfall of the west in the 19th century the idea of the west became a foil against which political theorists developed their recipes for progress and change russian slavophiles rejected what they saw as western individualism and the western advocacy of material progress based on industrial capitalism for example while russian westernizers saw their country s future very much in embracing these things in the early 20th century right wing nationalists in germany and central europe offered similar warnings excoriating what they saw as the decadent materialism spiritual weakness and moral corruption of a west that was no longer able to prevent its own decline foremost among them was oswald spengler whose book der untergang des abendlandes usually translated as the decline of the west became hugely popular in germany during the 1920s largely because it was read as a prophecy of germany s resurgence under a future nationalist dictatorship and then was taken not entirely accurately as a prediction of hitler s coming to power in 1933 during the cold war liberals contrasted what they portrayed as the west s preference for individual freedom representative democracy private property public education and scientific progress with the negation of these values that they claimed was found in the communist east this liberal concept of the west was incorporated into western civilization courses in american universities but not european ones and promulgated in major historical works like william h mcneill s 1963 the rise of the west which contained in its exposition of the rise spread and eventual supersession of other cultures in world history the implication that such a decline would also be the west s fate at some point these also became the themes of post cold war texts by conservatives like samuel p huntington and niall ferguson with their neo spenglerian predictions of the west s decline while reid henry doesn t embrace the conservative implications of these later works he does take for granted that the west for better or worse can be broadly equated with liberal democracy and the free market and so the measure of its decline is found in the failing health of these two institutions yet in today s world liberal democracy is as loaded a concept as it was during the cold war or at the turn of the 20th century if one looks at the economist intelligence unit s democracy index 2017 for example 89 countries became less democratic that year over three times the number that became more democratic many of these countries are found in the geographical west but they are present as well in other parts of the world democracy isn t necessarily western as the stable democratic political systems found outside the west from indonesia to tunisia surely indicate the truth is that histories of western democracy in the early 20th century no longer carry any kind of persuasiveness for the last decade or more historians have increasingly adopted a global approach that rejects the idea that the modern world was exclusively shaped or even mainly defined by the spread of western culture across the rest of the globe before his death in 2016 even the great william h mcneill came to the conclusion that his thesis concerning the rise of the west reflected the imperialist mood of postwar america and so he preferred instead to lay stress on the contacts and connections among civilizations rather than their rivalries and conflicts more recently global historians have been exploring the interconnectedness of different parts of the world and documenting their influences on one another the decline of democracy in europe and america and the economic crisis that lies at its heart are part of a general erosion of democratic and economic institutions worldwide while empire of democracy s title might suggest the continents spanning nature of the current moment s quandaries much of this goes unexplored the book offers a wide ranging narrative of what happened in one part of the world but because its scope is restricted by its reliance on the outdated notion of the west the full story of today s crisis remains to be told

coronavirus developments closely monitored what a start to the year it s been there was so much that could have gone wrong in the opening weeks of 2020 and yet it s been the completely unexpected that s rocked the markets this week it was the spread of coronavirus that s making investors nervous we re not in full panic mode just yet but there s clearly tensions building and the near 3 declines in china on the final day of trading before the new year holiday is a prime example of that central banks come back to the fore next week with a possible rate cut from the bank of england and first federal reserve meeting of the year the standout events the meeting marks a end to a messy tenure for boe governor mark carney and he could be going out with one final rate cut country uk the brexit bill as received royal ascent which means that in case it wasn t already clear the uk will leave the eu on 31 january and enter into the 11 month transitional period this is subject to eu lawmakers passing the brexit deal on wednesday but there s not expected to be any complications there although it would be very brexit if there was one last twist there may be no big ben bong for brexit if you ve not heard this story i envy you but the trade negotiation phase can now get underway not only is the uk keen to agree a new relationship with the eu in that time it also has admirable ambitions to strike one with the us as well that may be less complex but at the same time it doesn t make for an enjoyable 11 months for uk civil servants thankfully this coming week the topic of conversation will instead focus around the bank of england thursday s meeting has gone from a fond farewell to mark carney although brexiteers may remember him less fondly to an actual live meeting carney leaves the boe in mid march before the next meeting later that month it s become a coin toss for a rate cut which typically means it will be unchanged but odds have fluctuated quite dramatically over the last couple of weeks so that could change as we get closer to the vote us the fed is on hold and while no one expects any changes to the target range policymakers could tweak the ioer and provide some clarity on how they will end their purchases of treasury bills next quarter the january fomc meeting will likely see limited changes as the data since the december meeting has been slightly softer but countered by improved optimism following the us china phase one deal the dollar will stubbornly remain strong on safe haven flows but long term fed policy should provide a backdrop for weakness as the fed seems set for a path to see further balance sheet growth mexico the mexican peso will look to see if it remains one of the best performing currencies in latam the focus for peso traders will fall on preliminary fourth quarter gdp reading mexico is likely to see a boost from the usmca deal and while we could see a soft gdp reading raise calls for one more easing we may only see one or two more cuts by the banxico mexico has one of the best outlooks in latam and if the central bank maintains a high overnight rate carry traders may find the peso very attractive in 2020 hong kong coronavirus

indian equities market oil oil prices have been quite volatile this week not to mention one area that s been particularly sensitive to the breakout of coronavirus fears about the economic impact of a more severe outbreak appear to have hit oil prices at a time when demand dynamics are already a point of concern this is a very different response to what we saw in the aftermath of the libya outage which says a lot about where the concerns really lie in these markets brent has sold off quickly though so may be less sensitive to modest increases in the spread of the virus support may start to come in as it approaches 60 brent daily chart gold gold prices have been relatively stable over the last couple of weeks since events in the middle east settled down rallies are being sold into at the moment which signals weakness but the breakout of coronavirus could complicate things we re not seeing any significant safe haven moves right now but as the close in china on thursday prior to the weeklong new year holiday risk aversion is creeping in that could become more pronounced as the virus spreads and be supportive for gold prices gold daily chart bitcoin bitcoin is as volatile as ever and enthusiasts are desperate as ever to attribute any market event that impacts regular instruments to the cryptocurrency market we saw it earlier this year with the escalation in the middle east but they ve gone a little quiet this week bitcoin has been paring gains even as investors become a little more cautious once again raising huge question marks over its haven status still enthusiasts are relentless and that keeps the market volatile bitcoin daily chart

this article appears in the february 3 2020 issue my father always told me that all businessmen were sons of bitches john f kennedy once griped but i never believed it until now the young president recalled this pearl of wisdom in 1962 when the industrial giant us steel announced its plans to raise prices despite months of campaigning by the white house against such an increase steel was central to the us economy the new highway system the vast war machine the automobiles and the oil pipelines that fed them were all made from it if steel prices went up all prices went up threatening an inflationary spiral both harry truman and dwight eisenhower had sought to avert this and kennedy was no different making a public show of leaning on us steel to keep its prices down but the steel industry was determined to get its way under pressure from organized workers demanding higher wages it felt that it had very little choice 1 books in review goliath the 100 year war between monopoly power and democracy by matt stoller buy this book the 1960s are often remembered as the last decade of the golden age of egalitarian high growth capitalism the new deal reforms of the 1930s had something to do with this postwar boom but so did the corporate structure and market position of the giant vertically integrated industrial corporations like us steel in response to organized labor s challenge they were able to provide one of the great downward redistributions of income in the history of modern capitalism these companies could afford to do so in part because they enjoyed limited competition in their coordinated oligopolistic markets the us government had dismantled the formal price control system under pressure from manufacturers in 1946 and so it relied to a large degree on informal mechanisms so called jawboning to hold down prices often by inserting itself into collective bargaining processes in consolidated markets like steel and autos major american steel firms for example bargained jointly with the united steelworkers of america an affair of such economic significance that it spilled out of the private sector and repeatedly became a public matter contract after contract would wind up being settled in the white house whoever was president found that he could not afford the havoc of a protracted nationwide steel shutdown and so felt enormous pressure to deliver a victory to the steelworkers union but the white house also could not tolerate increases in the price of steel which were the employers device to pay for a union victory so a tripartite bargain was struck whose purpose for the government was to restrain wage and price growth enough to limit inflation but not so much as to leave workers dissatisfied 2 when business labor and government come together to determine how much goods would cost and workers would be paid the result can hardly be described as a market process the postwar years of the 1950s and 60s were the age of monopoly capitalism as the marxists then called it or less polemically an era of administered prices the cartelization of american industry had its negative effects including the technological stagnation of us manufacturing and the irresistible rise of inflation culminating in the chaotic 1970s but in any case it served many american workers well and at least for a time helped produce a more egalitarian country but when it finally came crashing down it took working class incomes with it a disaster from which we have yet to recover 3 popular swipe left below to view more authors swipe

margaret atwood what it takes to break joe biden s zionist bubble what it takes to break joe biden s zionist bubble jeet heer in recent years however a different account of the origin and nature of economic inequality has become popular in some quarters dubbed the new antitrust or new brandeisianism after supreme court justice louis brandeis who laid the intellectual foundation for vigorous market reform this approach offers a distinctive simple and insistent diagnosis of economic polarization rather than emphasize the punitive turn of social welfare programs the loss of union density and the underlying structural pressures on employers to suppress wages it instead argues that equality was undermined by the renascence of monopoly power monopolies today need not swallow a whole supply chain into a single corporation instead they work when a large firm dominates smaller ones dictating to them without needing to own them astride their respective economic sectors tech companies control our minds retail giants like amazon and walmart enforce terms of production on suppliers and terms of purchase on consumers and wall street firms extract a punishing toll from every movement of money and suck value from the whole economy together they are eroding the integrity of our political and economic systems 4 in his new book goliath the 100 year war between monopoly power and democracy matt stoller one of the most irrepressible members of this new generation of brandeisians elevates this argument to something like a theory of history for stoller all of american history and much of world history has been defined by a struggle between monopoly and democracy where property is concentrated its owners warp the public institutions that exist around them allowing them to concentrate property still more at the extreme ends of this quantitative process the monopolist captures the state itself with sovereignty a mere trapping of consolidated market power in the hands of a feudal lord or fascist dictator 5 over the history of the united states stoller finds the greatest nemesis of such authoritarian pretensions in america s anti monopoly tradition for him anti monopoly is fundamental to the fabric of american democracy it began with the american revolution which he describes as a revolt against the monopoly privileges of british merchants gained a mass following with jefferson became radicalized with the populists in the late 19th century tasted power with the progressives and culminated in the new deal and the mid 20th century us economy minimizing the centrality of corporatist coordination to that era stoller insists that the new deal was fundamentally an antitrust program its vigorous regulators broke the power that the robber barons accumulated in the 19th century and drove the moneychangers from the temple of democracy thereby ushering in a golden age of competition and freedom until this agenda was undermined by scurrilous and arrogant schemers in both parties who opened the way for a massive reassertion of corporate power beginning in the 1970s 6 what s so telling about this narrative is not only the fact that the golden age of competition that stoller wishes to restore is the very same period in which great vertically integrated oligopolies ruled the economy in coordination with one another labor unions and the state it is also that his expansive view of economic power still can t find a place for class conflict which although invisible to stoller was often the engine of downward redistribution in the midcentury boom because he does not grasp how the fundamental antagonism between labor and capital underlies other forms of economic rivalry stoller misunderstands the nature of the new deal and the legacy it leaves us as a result his book offers us a useful guide to some of the ills of concentrated market power today but does not ultimately come to terms with their real origin or present any viable political response 7 related article lauren wilkinson s novel of race empire and espionage jennifer wilson stoller initially gained some prominence in the early 2000s as a member of the cohort of progressive political bloggers who found their voice in the early years of the iraq war stoller at first supported the war but he soon became horrified by how the democratic establishment rolled over for the agenda of george w bush s administration and he and a set of his peers writers like matt yglesias ezra klein and markos moulitsas helped mobilize support for progressive reforms and the democrats who championed them 8 although stoller continued to see himself as an outsider in the years after barack obama s election he like the other members of this cohort joined the intellectual and political ranks of the dc machine and managed to establish their careers before the great recession started in 2008 moulitsas the founder of the website daily kos became an unofficial democratic party operative klein and yglesias emerged as celebrated policy journalists eventually launching the mammoth operation at vox by the end of the decade stoller for his part was working as an economic policy staffer in congress from this perch he watched with dismay as the obama white house did little to break from the prevailing economic consensus with clinton administration veterans larry summers rahm emanuel and timothy geithner back in power obama and his team of economic advisers sided with the lords of finance directing unimaginable streams of money to shore up wall street while letting millions of americans lose their homes to foreclosure 9 this marked a second phase in stoller s politicization it seemed clear to many of us during the bailouts he notes in goliath that the public would turn vehemently against the political establishment for taking their property their stake in america and so it has stoller left capitol hill and fell into the orbit of the anti monopoly thinkers and activists affiliated with the new america foundation particularly journalist barry lynn whose 2009 book cornered the new monopoly capitalism and the economics of destruction argued that hidden monopolies have insinuated themselves throughout our economy for stoller and this emerging anti monopoly clique the betrayal that took place after 2008 had a much longer history in the 1970s an affluent faction of democrats helped kill the party s populist soul 10 stoller began to formulate this thesis in historical terms in a widely shared essay that appeared in the atlantic shortly before trump won the 2016 election historians like judith stein and lily geismer told versions of this story before arguing that in the 1970s middle class professionals wrested control of the democratic party away from its blue collar social base and unleashed a set of market centric reforms and deregulatory schemes but stoller offers a somewhat different analysis the transformation that these middle class professionals helped to enact tilted the balance of class power in his view because it allowed the advance of market concentration and he tells this story primarily through the perspective of wright patman a democratic congressman from rural east texas a proud hillbilly and dogged foe of market consolidation and financial power as stoller announces early in goliath he sees this history through eyes in his telling democrats lost their way when the yuppie progressives often called the watergate babies swept into power in 1974 and ousted patman from his banking committee chairmanship with grave consequences the destruction of the anti monopoly and anti bank tradition in the democratic party stoller writes has also cleared the way for the greatest concentration of economic power in a century 11 in goliath he retells the story of patman and the fall of the new deal democratic party but stoller also aspires to something far grander he insists that almost all of american history can be understood in terms of the struggle between the forces of monopoly on the one hand and democracy on the other beginning with the feud between the aristocratic alexander hamilton and the democratic thomas jefferson and extending into the 20th century with the rise of woodrow wilson and franklin roosevelt tribunes of the people in the age of mass democracy glossed over or ignored outright here are the central roles in the jeffersonian popular tradition of génocidaire andrew jackson and of pro slavery politics it is in fact with wilson that goliath opens in earnest with his campaign for the presidency in 1912 when he faced off against theodore roosevelt as well as william howard taft and eugene debs over the question of what was to be done about the accumulation of economic power in the hands of the few railroad and coal barons mutilated their workers in spectacular workplace horrors while bankers lorded it over society like european aristocrats we stand at armageddon and we battle for the lord roosevelt declared and for him this battle required introducing a corporatist system that regulated but did not break up the new industrial giants for wilson who embraced the ideas of brandeis it meant splitting them up what he called a new freedom 12 in stoller s rendering of this story wilson attempted to launch something like a new deal and might have pulled it off if world war i hadn t gotten in the way but america s entrance into the war in 1917 and the economic chaos and reactionary politics that it unleashed allowed the reassertion of power by the forces of monopoly wilson so energetic at the beginning of his term stoller writes could do nothing by the end of his tenure except lie in bed as his administration jailed thousands of innocents and as the plutocrats swiftly subverted the new order he had imposed just a few years earlier apparently the wilson administration s reform agenda rested on the vision and energy of but a single figure and his physical decline brought the new freedom down with it the egalitarian ambitions of wilson and the anti monopoly tradition would have to be put on hold as andrew mellon the last of the great robber barons rose to power and as secretary of the treasury unleashed the oligarchic forces of the 1920s wealth accumulated at the top while the common people suffered a regime stoller calls mellonism 13 with the depression agency in the narrative shifts again from mellon and his accomplices to a new generation of anti monopolists including many in franklin roosevelt s brain trust and of course wright patman stoller s east texas hero patman arrived in washington in 1929 the year of the crash and almost immediately set about bird dogging mellon patman supported the marchers of the bonus army advocated cheap credit for farmers and wrote with arkansas senator joe robinson a landmark anti monopoly bill in 1936 that barred predatory pricing in retail 14 related article in marx s republic daniel luban a beneficiary of the south s racist one party system patman may have been a champion of economic competition but he also spent decades in power without much political competition accruing seniority and rising to the chairmanship of the banking committee this was the reason he drew the ire of the watergate babies in 1975 they wanted to eject the southerners from their powerful sinecures stoller unconvincingly suggests his great man was only as racist as he was obliged to be politically and was appreciated by his black constituents even if patman was after all one of only five texas democrats in the house to sign the 1956 southern manifesto denouncing the brown v board of education decision seventeen refused 15 one wishes stoller had paused to contemplate why anti monopoly tended to find its most vigorous advocates in white southerners like wilson robinson and patman he suggests this is merely a coincidence and that there existed no historical relationship between white supremacy and pro competitive politics in part this is because stoller really is interested only in telling us how the relentlessly populist patman s advocacy helped shape the new deal patman brought forward what the farmers of the 1890s demanded of their society a democracy with an egalitarian system of free enterprise where small business had the same shot as andrew mellon to compete he stood up to mellon he stood for the plain people and the veterans and in doing so he destroyed the legitimacy of the plutocrats that dominated america summarizing the emerging egalitarian era stoller observes finally after the second great war of the century democracy had taken hold in the commercial sphere 16 if this doesn t match your idea of the origins of the new deal era you re not alone wishing anti monopoly to be a politics for all times and places stoller cannot allow it any historical specificity he does not satisfactorily wrestle with the fact that patman and his antitrust attorney allies formed only one part of the new deal coalition anti monopoly was a part of a much larger political spectrum which also included corporatism of just the kind stoller abhors distinguishing among these elements is possible and one can argue that one is preferable to the other but doing so would also require acknowledging the existence and logic of another dimension of the new deal beyond antitrust and corporatism and that would mean considering labor and class 17 in goliath s second half stoller gives us his story of how the new deal s anti monopoly democracy was unmade some of the beats are familiar his narrative dwells on the rise of the chicago school of economics what stoller calls the new mellonism where american antitrust law was reinvented by characters like law professor aaron director economist george stigler and jurist robert bork the result was the law and economics movement which played an enormous role in changing doctrine in general and elevating the significance of consumer welfare in particular these thinkers constructed a consumer welfare standard for antitrust cases that didn t necessarily focus on big or small but rather cheap and thus became the cover under which market power reasserted itself whatever else amazon is it is cheap and convenient for the consumer 18 but the chicago school neoliberals and the politicians and judges they influenced were given valuable cover stoller argues by intellectuals on the left who saw in large scale economic concentration the basis of a social order beyond capitalism and saw in populism only backward looking reaction stoller reserves pages of bizarre vitriol here for sociologist c wright mills historian richard hofstadter and economist john kenneth galbraith whom he blames for eroding the ideological basis of antitrust in the postwar years hofstadter and galbraith together he tells us in a puzzling passage created a new language and new frame of analysis designed to eliminate the antimonopoly tradition in american politics a new villain the grubby racist small businessman had replaced the money trust as stoller concludes later on beautiful smugness is how john kenneth galbraith and richard hofstadter persuaded a generation to give up their liberties even if stoller s readings of these thinkers represented them accurately this would seem an awfully large role to assign to a sociologist a historian and an economist even unusually prominent ones 19 while neoliberalism germinated in chicago and smug intellectuals fulminated in new york finance regrouped set free from their wartime constraints and then from the constraints imposed by white house control over the fed bankers tried to seize more power stoller writes and financiers like citibank chief walter wriston and conglomerate mogul saul steinberg invented financial tools to manipulate the market including the certificate of deposit a bondlike instrument that allowed citibank to evade regulations meant to limit bank size when patman came after these bankers his success was mixed they had learned from the experience of the 1930s stoller writes 20 wriston didn t appear as a robber baron but a cosmopolitan executive who believed in racial tolerance liked rock n roll and wanted to be a responsible business leader in a technologically advanced society citibank as he told governors and local politicians didn t pollute and it went without mention that the bank didn t send soldiers to vietnam 21 perceiving an intersection between a fashionable cultural progressivism born out of the 1960s and a renascent economic oligarchy stoller continues affluent snobby liberals teamed up with bankers against the american people by the early 1970s everyone from ralph nader and the watergate babies to enlightened bankers and chicago school economists were working together to bring the curtain down on economic democracy with patman ousted in 1975 jimmy carter deregulating key markets shortly thereafter and democrats taking up the chicago school s ideas corporate power took off unshackled from regulatory constraints big box retail spread across small town america while banks and more exotic financial firms began to reassert themselves growing in size and power from there stoller offers us a straight line to the election of trump who fed on the democratic decay that set in once the regulatory state had been dismantled as stoller puts it in his atlantic essay the story of patman s ousting is part of the larger story of how the democratic party helped to create today s shockingly disillusioned and sullen public a large chunk of whom is now marching for donald trump 22 in this respect goliath is an ambitious and risky undertaking that proffers a century long narrative encompassing virtually every aspect of american political and economic life but stoller tends to tell his story from the perspective of individual politicians intellectuals and millionaires patman wilson brandeis mellon and the like structural forces recede personalities grow in importance and it becomes difficult to tell why anything is happening 23 for this reason great changes that stoller would like to trace tend to go unexplained except in terms of the greed and corruption or farsightedness and altruism of particular individuals wilson s federal reserve for example was a good idea designed to move power over the economy from wall street to the people until it fell into the hands of shortsighted private bankers who could not or would not stop speculative bubbles why how the defeat of wilson s ostensibly benevolent peace plan is also attributed to the machinations of robber barons frick and mellon believed that america should use its power solely to enhance american financial interests not to engage in some scheme for world peace the two men saw opposition to the as a way to discredit the democrats and drive them from power mellon then became the most powerful man in the country king andrew setting the stage in turn for the stock market crash of 1929 everything in this narrative is about market power and market power is about greed and opportunity 24 yet when one attempts to peer beneath this layer of individual action avaricious or heroic stoller s narrative begins to unravel in order to conjure up a united front of the common people against corporate power he repeatedly collapses the distinction between the problem of monopoly and the problem of class again and again he cites capital s offenses against labor as evidence of the need for anti monopoly measures writing phrases like small businessman and blue collar worker as if the reader will not notice he has named two separate things 25 stoller isn t wrong in asserting that there were many working class people invested in breaking the power of the robber barons but anti monopoly as it emerged as a mass movement in the late 19th century was only one component of what was often called the social question or if you were less inclined to euphemism the labor question to be sure agrarian rebels demanded the death of the money power while huge strike waves shook the country in 1877 and again in 1886 developing into general strikes in multiple cities the united states saw repeated instances of workers shutting down large sections of the nation s rail network in wild out of control confrontations gun battles between unions and company thugs became more and more common as in homestead pennsylvania in 1892 and cripple creek colorado in 1894 but at issue in these labor conflicts was not just the cartelization of the economy but the whole system of relationships that made up america s social order in particular the wages system that is capitalist labor markets and its bouts of wage cuts and unemployment when workers in these struggles denounced monopolies they often did so because they viewed concentrated capital as part of a deeper problem capitalism itself they struck because industrial wage labor was a new form of domination and they wished to diminish and eventually end it 26 for stoller however inequality and the class tensions it unleashed are made not inside the process of production but in the commercial sphere industry and commerce however are obviously not the same thing and this conflation leads him to serious conceptual problems the political issues that arise from production occur between labor and capital over wages hours safety unionization workers control and so on and are quite distinct from conflicts over market power which occur between capital and capital and as the legal scholar lina khan put it concern product quality variety and innovation as well as prices the two are related to each other as when labor markets take on monopsonistic characteristics but they remain distinct yet wherever he looks stoller sees the two spheres as one and accordingly vexed by the same question what to do about the robber barons which is to say the issue of concentration at the top social inequality the relationship between the classes and the maldistribution of economic and political power are all collapsed into a question of the bigness and badness of the biggest baddest members of the elite 27 he is also correct in asserting that anti monopoly sentiment has enjoyed a large social base in american history but it was not among the people in general and certainly not the working class in particular rather it was a politics that arose among several distinct social and economic groups as they came under increasing economic pressure around the turn of the 20th century and settled on trust busting as the instrument of their relief they were not all of one kind there were farmers and craftsmen shopkeepers and small businessmen spread out across small towns and the countryside these groups linked up with progressive lawyers and professionals in the first third of the 20th century especially those influenced by brandeis who believed that market regulation could limit the power of corporations in order to produce a stable harmonious social order 28 current issue view our current issue yet since stoller takes as a given that anti monopoly populists speak on behalf of the people as an organic whole he presents patman and the antitrust activists in the new deal as the entirety of that project s egalitarian thrust invisible in his account is the northern social democratic politics of millions of working class americans that i think i m on safe ground here was also quite influential in shaping that era s policies whether or not you rate antitrust as important it still beggars belief to see it as a more significant force in the remaking of american society in the 1930s than the insurgency of millions of industrial workers and the wave of reforms they won the national labor relations act which established union rights the social security act which created the eponymous program as well as family assistance and unemployment insurance the fair labor standards act which established the 40 hour workweek and the minimum wage and banned child labor and indirectly legislation touching on housing and urban development veterans policy and more 29 a telling example of stoller s oversight in this regard comes in his narrative of the southern crusade of small businesses and farmers against the predations of the a p market chain while relating this story stoller mentions as an aside that the giant chain struck an alliance with the american federation of labor and various progressive consumer and cooperative groups to strengthen its hand against the antitrusters this anti anti monopoly alliance which wedded the interests of labor to those of a large corporation represents the spirit and logic of the new deal at least as well as patman does stoller however cannot see it as anything but opportunism the fact that patman supported the taft hartley act establishing right to work laws and hobbling the labor movement also goes unexplored 30 to be fair part of the problem here is that the new deal was itself a fundamentally equivocal and contradictory regime it attempted to marry market regulation and antitrust with an implicit corporatism while breaking up and regulating some markets liberal policy makers continued to pursue high level social bargains among capital labor and consumers explicitly until 1935 and tacitly and indirectly for decades thereafter stoller hyperbolically draws parallels between the former efforts those that accepted or even encouraged corporatist social compromises with fascism and then proceeds to ignore them as a key component of democratic rule from the new deal to the great society but his elision of the centrality of labor management conflict and compromise also leads him to elevate antitrust from a component of liberal policy to a synonym for democracy and freedom 31 goliath finds a key case study for example in the way the federal government set up competitors to alcoa s aluminum monopoly in the 1940s this move meant to keep the supply of aluminum flowing for the war machine is presented as substantiation of stoller s reimagined version of world war ii as a global struggle between monopoly and free competition one wonders where the soviet union is in this account but as historian jonathan bean observes two thirds of major war production contracts went to the largest 100 corporations and two thirds of research and development money went to 68 firms small manufacturers shrank dramatically over the war years in terms of relative employment while large ones grew after the war when it came time to reconvert the 17 billion of publicly owned defense industries to privatized civilian production two thirds of their economic value went to 87 firms bean writes the federal government sold all of its synthetic rubber facilities to the big four rubber companies and allowed u s steel to purchase 71 percent of all the publicly built steel plants the steel monopoly as we already noted became a key mechanism in the balance between capital and labor struck by new deal liberals allowing for wage increases for the organized workers who formed the base of the democratic party yet you simply will not encounter in goliath the overwhelming counterevidence that suggests the new deal was marked by such social democratic features balanced on oligopolistic markets 32 all of this is to not discount the fact that the new deal experimented in antitrust efforts more actively than what came before it or after it but it did so while helping to bolster a monopolistic and quasi corporatist economic system the new deal and its heirs in other words rested on multiple pillars white southern democrats wanted cheap manufactured goods competitive markets and decentralized power that protected their racial order in the south the multiethnic multiracial and working class coalition of northern democrats wanted high wages and stable employment in industry the tension between these two structural as well as ideological in nature eventually consumed the party in the 1970s in the economic chaos called stagflation 33 for someone making a political argument by way of history stoller can view monopoly quite ahistorically for many monopoly is a more or less inevitable result of capitalist development marxists have argued that market consolidation is a mechanism by which capitalism has managed its periodic crises by socializing production or summoning together the once dispersed productive powers of society into a collective force monopoly at once advanced capitalism s development and produced a kind of socialism in embryo trapped by its private ownership structure for capitalists this was true too j p morgan saw the rise of monopoly as an irresistible element of capitalism breaking up the trusts was as impossible he said as unscrambling an omelet as a historical phenomenon that is developing over time in relation to particular contexts of events monopoly has qualities that make it difficult to reverse on this view anti monopoly is useful only within a larger account of the development and trajectory of capitalism itself of which monopoly is just a symptom 34 but for stoller monopoly is something that exists mostly outside time and the particularities of political economy the essence of monopolization can be found in both medieval feudalism and 20th century fascism china too stoller tells us is just one giant monopoly the phenomenon has no distinct cause other than the greed of the powerful and the power of the greedy it is merely the name for what happens when greed and power meet it has in this sense no history that can be related except through the machinations of individuals nefarious or heroic 35 operating with an anti monopoly analysis but not a historical one stoller as a result constantly gets things only half right what of the party of the people the democrats he asks as he moves into the 1980s and 90s throughout american history the triumph of plutocrats in a decade provoked a backlash and the opposing party would win a series of elections and reorient political economy but the chicago school has dismantled this fail safe stoller is of course correct that the democrats failed utterly to channel the miseries of neoliberalism into a political challenge and instead have served as handmaidens to worsening inequality but the idea that this collaboration is due to the influence of the chicago school in particular as opposed to much larger structural forces that have prevailed around the world is not an analysis it s a conspiracy theory it also excludes almost all of the important reasons democrats turned rightward and implies no theory of what might be done to counteract this no vision of politics follows from the insight that elites sometimes scheme and accrue influence this becomes a genuinely political idea only when it can be used to develop a specific vision of conflicting interests friends who might be organized and enemies who must be divided and overcome they re for the powerful we re for the people is something al gore said in his acceptance speech for the democrats 2000 presidential nomination one hopes for something a bit more precise in a 600 page book 36 the ahistorical and thus apolitical quality of stoller s book becomes even more apparent when he attempts to generalize the perfectly sound idea of breaking up some monopolies into a transcendent principle of democratic life that the basis for all forms of freedom social economic political lies in open access to commerce each of us he rhapsodizes in his conclusion is a worker a businessperson a consumer and a citizen i am not a businessperson and i suspect this may be true for many of my readers too as far as i can tell even stoller is not a businessperson many in this country are of course also not citizens as we are grimly reminded every day even in the working class millions are not workers in the strictest sense many students incarcerated people disabled people retirees and the unemployed do not perform wage work 37 yet stoller s eye can track only the disposal of property and in it he finds liberty itself capital encounters merely other capital big or small the vast majority of us who lack property that we can live off and thus must sell our labor power to survive are visible in this analysis only if we re conceived of as tiny capitalists stoller s history as a result is blind to the structural coercion of workers that brings them into their encounter with capital and gives capitalism its fundamental character for those of us who cannot live off our property the economy is not where we become free through trade it is where we become unfree through work or the lack of it property is a relationship not an object the liberty it grants some is always domination for others the jeffersonian smallholder class for example was built on the backs or the land of women children slaves low wage and migrant workers and indigenous people a focus solely on market relations loses sight of this political and economic domination 38 stoller s framework also causes him to present anti monopoly as a principle transcending differences between the right and the left an approach that gives space to a nationalist vision of the people as an integral whole and who are beset by insidious outsiders on the hunt for anti monopolists of all shapes and sizes he finds an ally in senator josh hawley a national conservative who delivered a thinly veiled anti semitic speech about the cosmopolitan attack on america s common culture because of hawley s criticism of big tech it seems likely that stoller is naive here rather than cynical but it can be only one of the two in the same vein he has become an advocate of confrontation with china writing in foreign policy the era of strong private corporate power is over public power is being reasserted over u s corporations the only question is whether the public power that assumes control of western corporations and thus western society is american or chinese 39 one need not applaud the regime in beijing to dread where this goes and stoller also regularly bemoans the effects of monopoly on america s weapons making capacity and recently criticized tech workers for protesting their employers work with the pentagon warfare tech and ai isn t necessarily about killing he explained on twitter and weakening the military institutions isn t the right way to change war policy 40 throughout the book stoller distinguishes his anti monopoly politics from the socialist and social democratic traditions of the left since he sees the tradition stretching from jefferson to patman as the core of democratic politics in america anything that falls outside the spectrum between hamilton and jefferson is invisible an illegitimate infiltrator or an especially curious specimen of hamiltonism or jeffersonism if you follow his commentary you ll know for example that he s convinced that w e b du bois s classic black reconstruction a book that speaks approvingly of reconstruction as a dictatorship of the proletariat is merely an entry in the jeffersonian tradition contrary to du bois s marxist intentions this reading rests precisely on a misunderstanding of the desire of freed slaves to own land as an impulse toward small business rather than the wish to be free of the supervisor s lash 41 it is clear from the outset of goliath that stoller very evidently wishes for a more just and equal world and many of his solutions breaking up and regulating the big banks and tech companies for example would be far preferable to the status quo but he does not explain any of the reasons an anti monopoly politics might win or achieve any staying power if all of american history is defined by the struggle between the great heroes of anti monopoly democracy and the avarice of mellonism then why would powerful and greedy men not machinate once more against antitrust laws why wouldn t disdainful intellectuals conspire against the people s cause yet again if the prevalence of monopoly as stoller insists bears no relation to the larger social and economic environment and is purely a voluntary choice then there s no reason to believe that anti monopoly can produce a stable resolution to the problem of corporate power from where might antitrust politics draw social and political power with a mass base of farmers craftsmen and small businessmen long gone what might bind the people as a whole together to confront their overlords by way of employment in some cases low prices or convenience in others the monopolies that he detests have sunk their roots into large sections of society come after amazon and you come after its tens of millions of users too 42 the socialism that stoller dismisses emerged precisely in answer to these problems it contends that capitalism gives rise not once but repeatedly to a potentially coherent and antagonistic social force capable of collective action this is the working class because capitalism produces a larger population over time that cannot survive from its own property and therefore joins many of these people at sites of collective labor it makes it possible for them to organize and then to exercise leverage and political leadership over other sectors of society this is the reason that the most exciting intellectual work in antitrust is being done by scholars who work on market power specifically in employment such as sanjukta paul suresh naidu and marshall steinbaum one may criticize the socialist s faith in the working class as politically naive or empirically inaccurate but in any case socialism and beneath it marxism as well contains a theory of politics a definite account of friends and enemies and why each is what it is whereas stoller s populism does not this is why socialists have proved to be so much less prone to deviations into jingoism and conspiracy theory than their populist peers 43 one might also add that socialism and anti monopoly are not necessarily opposed in recent history as well in the new deal era the two have blended in a combined opposition to the current economic and political order for both sides this blending together has been both opportunistic and fruitful the presence in the presidential race of candidates who approximately represent each ideology illustrates the dynamic of this marriage of convenience the socialist who speaks of class war allows the anti monopolist to leverage her plans for fixing it into popularity in turn the plan maker must mimic the socialist s positions in order for her gambit to succeed thus validating his ideas each gets to obfuscate usefully through the presence of the other and because they share enemies wall street and its political representatives 44 but stoller s book also demonstrates some of the underlying differences anti monopolists oppose the economic elite but not the social system that gave rise to it likewise between socialism and anti monopoly lies a vast difference in analysis about the nature of the state and indeed power itself for the anti monopolist the state is a shield for the people against their plutocratic enemies power inheres in the state and it is only a question of whether the people capture it through elections the anti monopolist agenda is therefore to put the good expert into office where she may wield the regulatory power of the state for the common good for the socialist on the other hand the state is not neutral its purpose and nature are to serve the interests of the ruling class if it can be remade to serve the working class this project cannot be achieved without enormous social conflict and this change can come only from below not just through elections but through sustained attacks on authority at every level in workplaces schools families neighborhoods and beyond friendly elements within the state may lend important support to such struggles and this is one of the reasons socialists seek state power but socialism cannot be achieved solely by means of such power 45 which of these analyses you believe and which diagnosis you accept is in part the result of the different historical narratives that we tell if you think the problem we face is something like crony capitalism or money in politics then there is one weird trick that will fix it reining in the too powerful corporations often by using laws already on the books in order to get back to the people s business this program often presented as structural change nonetheless represents an explicitly superficial approach the idea that our economy has acquired a predatory parasitic stratum at its top that needs to be stripped off allowing the underlying system to work as intended explicitly or not it s the promise of a return to a lost utopia of markets a society without fundamental antagonisms if on the other hand you think our problems are deeper woven more fundamentally into the structure of how we live together which things and people we value and which we discard who must wear the saddle and who gets to ride then there s no going back if the problem lies with capitalism as a system and not specific malicious capitalists then we ve got to embark on an adventure of a different kind one that leads us not back to the comforts of midcentury america but somewhere wild and new goliath will not help us find the way 46
u s review something in the air fears of an escalating coronavirus outbreak reached the united states this week as a washington state man became the first confirmed domestic case and the international total reached more than 800 we expect any short term economic impact to be limited and concentrated in east asia but the u s economy is certainly more vulnerable to shocks at this stage in the cycle sentiment matters on the home front december existing home sales rose a solid 3 6 to a 5 54 million unit pace as the housing market renaissance continues something in the air fears of an escalating coronavirus outbreak reached the united states this week as a washington state man became the first confirmed domestic case and the international total reached over 800 we expect any short term economic impact to be limited and concentrated in east asia see our initial report and page 4 of this report for more detail the 2003 sars outbreak is perhaps the most relevant comparison but the coronavirus is reportedly not as deadly and containment methods today are ostensibly more effective on the other hand a simple historical comparison misses the fact that retail spending travel and personal consumption are a much more important driver of the chinese economy today 16 years later a potential downside risk to estimates of a virusinduced economic deceleration the focus this week on epidemiology rather than economics is not unwarranted the heightened financial market attention to medical reports out of central china did indeed have a lot to do with the scarcity of new economic data but it is also true that the u s economy is more vulnerable to shocks in the 11th year of the expansion seemingly far off events an asian virus outbreak or the killing of an iranian general can spark a rapid deterioration in sentiment which can quickly affect spending habits and the real economy thus while a cold look at the numbers suggests no reason to panic the single u s case of coronavirus is dwarfed by the 6 600 deaths from the flu already this season according to the cdc it is fear that can have an outsized impact on the economy particularly at this stage of the cycle the world economic forum in davos also got its usual dose of media attention but passed without major fanfare as the assembled politicians and business executives expressed confidence in the global economy the imf was slightly less optimistic reducing its global growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 by 0 1 percentage point to 2 9 and 3 3 respectively it similarly downgraded its u s forecasts to 2 3 and 2 0 still the highest among the g7 on the sidelines president trump turned his attention from china to the eu again threatening tariffs if a deal isn t reached before the election eu officials promised to retaliate on the home front december existing home sales rose a solid 3 6 to a 5 54 million unit pace as the housing market renaissance continues lower mortgage rates have brought buyers back into the market particularly in the south and west where population and employment growth remain the strongest the rebound in existing home sales follows a string of positive housing reports and will have sizable pass through effects including realtors commissions and remodeling spending inventories are extremely low however which is driving price appreciation higher again the median single family home price rose 8 0 year over year in december which is spurring more construction housing starts reached a 13 year high in december and builder optimism is holding near 20 year highs with this backdrop and no discernible uptick in jobless claims the housing market is clear for further gains u s outlook durable goods tuesday month to month changes in durable goods orders are notoriously volatile and the past few months have been no exception ongoing struggles at boeing with its 737 max aircraft more on that in topic of the week on page 7 as well as the recent gm strike have resulted in some large swings in underlying order components that said tuesday s december durable goods report should be rather boring attention will be on nondefense capital goods shipments since they feed into the bureau of economic analysis bea calculation of equipment spending in the gdp report this will be a good indication of what to expect from this component for q4 output which will be released two days later after declining at a 3 4 annualized pace in q3 the weakest since 2015 we expect equipment spending remained flat to end the year elsewhere our focus will be on any sign of stabilization in the sector after manufacturing took a hit last year amid trade uncertainty previous 2 1 wells fargo 0 9 consensus 1 0 month over month q4 u s gdp thursday to many q4 may already seem like a distant memory but on thursday market attention will turn to the bea s q4 gdp release we expect the economy expanded at a 2 3 annualized pace in the final quarter of the year this gain is largely predicated on a sizeable boost from net exports as the november international trade report showed a larger narrowing in the trade deficit for the month than previously anticipated outside of trade keep an eye on the residential construction line residential investment seems to be a bright spot in the outlook demand is on the rise as lower mortgage rates entice prospective buyers to enter the market consumer spending shouldn t be much of a surprise we re expecting a 2 2 gain which is still strong but a step down from the prior two quarters business investment spending is expected to remain weak in q4 as addressed in the durable goods section but should climb out of its slump in 2020 previous 2 1 wells fargo 2 3 consensus 2 2 annualized quarter over quarter personal income spending friday by the time the bea releases its december personal income and spending report on friday we will already have q4 personal consumption expenditure pce data nonetheless the report is still likely to garner much attention the last month of the quarter can be particularly important in gauging consumer spending momentum for the next quarter meaning a solid gain in december would set q1 consumption off to a good start our expectation of a 0 4 gain in spending should do just that we already know december was a strong month for retail sales which rose a solid 0 3 as control group sales which exclude volatile purchases like gasoline autos food services and building materials were up 0 5 the control group is a good proxy for personal spending on goods in the gdp accounts and suggests our expectation for a 2

china s coronavirus spreading to financial markets for the last three weeks a new coronavirus has originated in china and spread across asia most recently the virus was confirmed to have entered the united states sparking reminders of the sars epidemic that plagued china and asia in the early 2000s these fears have reached financial markets with asian and chinese asset prices coming under pressure over the last few weeks with travel restrictions put in place and the chinese new year approaching chinese economic activity data could be affected however we would expect any disruptions to be short lived china coronavirus scaring markets but for how long over the past few weeks a new coronavirus originating from the city of wuhan china has spread across asia and into the united states to date there have been more than 800 confirmed cases around the world while the virus has claimed at least 25 lives the virus is still in its early stages but has already drawn comparisons to the outbreak of sars severe accurate respiratory syndrome that plagued china and other parts of asia in the early 2000s as of now doctors and scientists have indicated the wuhan coronavirus is not as severe as sars however this has not prevented chinese authorities from taking preemptive action in an effort to stem the virus effect and prevent it from spreading globally in just the last week the chinese government has implemented travel restrictions in and out of the city of wuhan while other municipalities have placed constraints around the use of public transportation in addition the world health organization who has determined the virus is not yet a global public health emergency a designation used for complex epidemics that can easily spread internationally but noted it may yet become one in addition to its effect on the global population the coronavirus has also rattled investors and financial markets particularly in china and financial hubs across asia since the beginning of this week the shanghai composite equity index has sold off about 4 0 while the hong kong hang seng equity index is down close to 3 5 the chinese renminbi has also moved lower as a result selling off roughly 1 0 over the same time period while other emerging asian currencies have also weakened as investor sentiment toward the region has soured we would expect asset prices within emerging asia to remain under some pressure in the short term as the severity and the ability to contain the virus are still unclear at this time there may also be some effect on china s economy as this week marks the beginning of the chinese new year typically a time for increased travel and retail spending within the country given the travel restrictions and general fear of contagion we would expect economic activity to decelerate in the short term but not necessarily to a degree that we would be overly concerned with looking further ahead and despite details of the virus being scarce we do not expect a major long term effect on financial markets or the global economy we think the risk off tone toward asian asset prices the last few weeks is likely to dissipate while the likelihood of the recent negative sentiment affecting u s and other developed financial markets is quite low as far as longer term economic effects we believe the coronavirus outbreak will not have any meaningful or long lasting effect on china s economy or any major influence over the economic health of other asian countries in fact a report from the brookings institute estimating the economic effect of sars determined annual gdp in china was reduced roughly 1 in 2003 but the economy recovered quite quickly at this time we do not expect a similar effect from the new coronavirus and as mentioned believe economic effects will be short term in nature global outlook bank of england thursday following a string of weak economic and sentiment data over the last few months market participants have started to consider the possibility the bank of england boe could ease monetary policy last week december retail sales significantly underperformed expectations while monthly gdp data released in mid january indicated the economy contracted in november tack on uncertainties regarding the future trade relationship between the u k and e u and the case for interest rate cuts becomes a bit more compelling however recent jobs and wage growth data indicate a relatively healthy labor market and in our view should result in the bank of england holding policy rates steady next week formal approval of boris johnson s withdrawal agreement should also keep the boe on hold as of now markets are implying about a 45 chance of a boe rate cut next week which should the boe hold rates firm could result in some upside for the british currency previous 0 75 wells fargo 0 75 consensus 0 75 china manufacturing pmi thursday the phase i trade deal with the u s secured in mid december and officially signed earlier this month likely takes some pressure off the chinese economy going forward a slight rollback of existing tariffs should also help the manufacturing sector pick up in the coming months as of now consensus forecasts suggest the manufacturing pmi may dip slightly in january to 50 1 but remain in expansionary territory in our view we would not be overly surprised if this data point beat consensus forecasts given some of the renewed optimism around china s economy following the phase i trade deal in addition recent gdp data matched consensus expectations with the economy growing 6 0 year over year in q4 2019 a welcome sign given how trade tensions have affected the economy over the last year or so we do not expect a major effect on china s economic data as a result of the new coronavirus with any effect on soft data likely to be short lived previous 50 2 consensus 50 0 eurozone gdp friday in recent months eurozone economic data have shown notable improvements in particular the service sector has been quite resilient with retail sales growth firming while the manufacturing sector remains relatively subdued an improving service sector could underpin a more optimistic growth profile for the eurozone in addition to a stronger service sector inflation has picked up recently with core cpi inflation quickening to 1 3 year over year while market based expectations for inflation have also moved higher consensus forecasts expect growth to remain constant in q4 at 0 2 quarter over quarter in addition we currently forecast the eurozone economy to expand a little more than 1 0 this year with risks around that forecast tilted toward the upside given an improved economic outlook and a relatively steady euro we expect the european central bank will keep policy rates on hold for the time being however it will continue its bond buying program to provide additional stimulus to the eurozone economy previous 0 2 consensus 0 2 quarter over quarter point of view interest rate watch foreign central banks on hold a number of major central banks held policy meetings this week and as largely expected each decided to keep its policy stance unchanged on tuesday the bank of japan boj left its main policy rate unchanged at 0 10 where it has been maintained since january 2016 in addition the boj kept in place its yield curve control whereby it aims to keep the yield on the 10 year japanese government bond around zero percent top chart we do not envision the boj making any material changes to its policy stance in the foreseeable future a day later the bank of canada boc left its main policy rate unchanged at 1 75 where it has been maintained since october 2018 middle chart however the statement that was released at the conclusion of the meeting had a dovish tone notably the boc said that it will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast in that regard the boc forecasts that real gdp in canada will grow 1 6 in 2020 and 2 0 next year we look for the boc to keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1 75 through at least the end of this year however we acknowledge that the probability of a boc rate cut is higher than the probability of a rate hike over that timeframe on thursday the european central bank left its three main policy rates unchanged bottom chart we had been forecasting that the governing council would reduce its deposit rate from 0 50 to 0 60 at its policy meeting on march 12 however as we describe in a recent report we no longer look for an ecb rate cut specifically it appears that growth in the eurozone is stabilizing albeit at a low level following the deceleration that over the past two years in addition core cpi inflation rate has ticked up in recent months but at only 1 3 it remains well below the ecb s target of below but close to two percent therefore we would characterize the balance of risks to our new ecb forecast of no further rate cuts as skewed toward further easing that is if growth stumbles and or inflation moves lower again the possibility of an ecb rate cut later this year remains credit market insights c i loans slowing to a crawl after registering a double digit pace at the start of the 2019 commercial and industrial c i loan growth fell to 2 2 on a year ago basis in december the slowest pace since february 2018 c i lending which funds firms operations and investments has tracked a slowdown in business spending as firms have showed little appetite for investment the senior loan officer opinion survey has shown more banks reporting weaker c i loan demand for the last five quarters some of this has been led by a pullback in the energy sector where a lack of new oil wells has contributed to outright declines in structures investment over the last two quarters the rig count has stabilized to start the year and our forecast calls for a modest improvement in structures investment going forward there is still not a great deal of optimism surrounding investment in the energy sector however suggesting a big bounce back is unlikely in the dallas fed s latest energy survey two thirds of executives surveyed expected their capital spending to decrease or remain about the same in 2020 outside of the energy sector lingering uncertainty from the trade war and weaker earnings will likely keep a cap on investment and lending growth our forecast for a modest improvement in investment in coming quarters could drive loan demand however a rebound would be limited by banks which have reported tightening lending standards despite delinquency rates near record lows topic of the week delayed expectations boeing now does not expect its 737 max aircraft to return to service until mid 2020 due to the certification process taking longer than expected this is months after the manufacturer previously anticipated a delay which could have knock on effects across the economy to date there has been little evidence of pass through effects from the grounding since boeing continued to produce 42 max aircraft a month down only slightly from its previous rate of 52 a month the grounding resulted in more of an accounting disturbance in the gdp accounts with a decline in equipment spending and exports aircraft are counted once shipped largely offset by a build in inventories but the delayed timeline presents a new source of concern a halt in production directly affects boeings suppliers and since production of the aircraft was only halted at the start of the year the effect to suppliers is yet to be realized boeing has released little detail regarding when it expects to resume production so our baseline expectation has been that it will occur alongside a restart in shipments once the plane is given the all clear to fly again the exact timeline of course remains largely uncertain perhaps making it even more difficult for suppliers to weather the storm suppliers may be forced to pare back hiring or even lay off workers depending on how much they rely on boeing and their position in the 737 max supply chain spirit aerosystems supplier of boeing has already said it would lay off 2 800 employees as more than 50 of its annual revenue comes from building components specifically for the 737 max aerospace production parts related employment directly represents only 0 3 of u s employment if you expand that to include other types of suppliers that amount surely would be higher however layoffs in the sector would still likely not be large enough to have a broad effect on the u s labor market furthermore boeing should eventually resume production and shipments of its max aircraft meaning if layoffs are to occur the unemployment would be temporary

following boris johnson s dominant election victory in december it appears the uk is edging ever closer to brexit one of johnson s key campaign promises was to deliver on the results of the referendum in 2016 and allow the nation to move on from the chaos that has dominated british politics for more than three years following his election victory johnson promised we can start a new chapter in the history of our country in which we come together and move forward united unleashing the enormous potential of the british people he added that he wanted to make the 2020s a decade of prosperity and opportunity but where does that leave the uk s relationship with its other trade partners and is there an opportunity for britain to strengthen its ties with nigeria the two nations have a long trade history and the latest data places nigeria among the largest markets for uk exports although at this moment there is no existing trade deal between the uk and nigeria aside from world trade organisation ties and the uk s status as a most favoured nation their most favoured nation status means the uk enjoys the lowest tariffs the fewest trade barriers and the highest import quotas but could the ties to nigeria become stronger in the fall out of brexit and against the backdrop of the us china trade war this economic conflict between the world s biggest markets poses a threat to nigeria as africa s top oil producer due to the tariffs being levelled by the two countries on the other s imports speaking in 2019 muda yusuf of the lagos chamber of commerce explained the us and china are the two biggest economies in the world so if they are having issues with respect to trade it will affect the global economy it will slow down growth and when we have a slowdown in growth it will invariably affect commodity prices so we are likely to see a drop in crude oil price and it will affect nigeria because we are heavily dependent on oil the recent easing of the trade war between the nations could offer some respite but could the uk s severing of trade ties with eu member states offers an opportunity for stronger trading connections with nigeria in may of last year the uk s then foreign secretary jeremy hunt confirmed that britain would aim to deepen its insurance sector ties to nigeria through the introduction of naira dominated instruments in london s financial markets this is great news for the global strength of the naira which has dropped in value against the british pound by around half since the turn of the century and the explosion in popularity of forex trading online means that these markets are now being evaluated and discussed more than ever the list of forex brokers operating online is growing globally and nigeria is no exception to that trend as a result more and more citizens are paying attention to the nation s trade links and paying closer attention to the brexit picture unfolding thousands of miles away source pexels the two countries commercial relationship is already underpinned by more than 6 1bn worth of annual trade uk brands remain in very high demand throughout nigeria especially luxury items while nigeria s low income tax rates make the nation an exciting prospect for british investors and as the nation edges ever closer to finally leaving the eu we could see those ambitions of greater investment finally realized but the uk isn t the only country paying closer attention to nigeria and recognizing its trade potential if their trade war with china continues to cool the usa could further develop its presence in nigeria beyond its present investment which was placed at 5 6bn in 2018 and increase its activities to support smes in the country president donald trump emphasised america s friendship with nigeria on the occasion of the 59th independence anniversary last year describing the nation as our strongest partners in africa he also affirmed that vice president mike pence and nigerian vice president yemi osinbajo were working together to build on the two countries long standing history of co operation indeed the pair came together last june to discuss trade reforms among other topics but the slowdown caused by the tensions with china is bad news for countries that are trade partners of the two economic superpowers and nigeria s hopes of capitalizing on additional investment from america and potentially reducing its debt profile of n26trn could be dashed this perhaps makes the uk a much safer bet for future growth and prime minister johnson will undoubtedly be eager to promote trade discussions with new partners following his nation s exit from the eu but it falls on nigeria to make the most of this opportunity as there will be many other nations seeking to make inroads and capitalize on the uk s desire to strengthen its international trade links outside of europe
home search ich how republicans made millions on the tax cuts they pushed through congress the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act is a case study of how lawmakers make themselves richer with the bills they pass by peter cary center for public integrity january 24 2020 information clearing house as part of the bill republicans approved tax breaks in 2017 for seven classes of assets many of the wealthier members of congress held at the time including partnerships small corporations real estate and several esoteric investment vehicles while they sold the bill as a package of business and middle class tax cuts that would not help the wealthy the cuts likely saved members of congress hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes collectively while the corporate tax cut hiked the value of their holdings it feels to me like a kleptocracy said jeff hauser director of the revolving door project at the center for economic and policy research a left leaning think tank in washington dc such congressional self enrichment has been thrust into the 2020 presidential campaign democratic candidate sen elizabeth warren has said her first priority as president would be to pass an anti corruption package that among other things would forbid members of congress from owning individual stocks bonds and other securities so they could not benefit from tax or financial laws they passed under current law members of congress can trade stocks and then use their powerful positions to increase the value of those stocks and pad their own pockets warren wrote in a september medium post republicans own lots of stock two years after the passage of the trump tax act its effects some obvious some hidden are coming into focus one is its cost contrary to republican claims the law is not paying for itself and is likely to burden the nation with an additional 1 9 trillion in debt over 11 years beginning in 2018 according to the congressional budget office and while the law cut tax rates for people of all income brackets some of its tax benefits overtly favored the wealthy such as the 2 6 percentage point tax rate cut in the highest bracket and the doubling of the estate tax exemption to 11 2 million other provisions were subtler yet favored the wealthy even more tax breaks for their investments for instance or changes that boosted the value of their stocks among the rich beneficiaries are members of congress more than half of whom were found to be millionaires in 2014 are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter the tax law s centerpiece is its record cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent at the time of its passage most of the bill s republican supporters said the cut would result in higher wages factory expansions and more jobs instead it was mainly exploited by corporations which bought back stock and raised dividends in 2018 stock buybacks exceeded 1 trillion for the first time ever according to trimtabs an investment research firm net corporate dividends reached a new high in 2018 of more than 1 3 trillion nearly 6 percent more than the previous year the result analysts say the buybacks boosted stock prices and bigger dividends put even more money in the pockets of stockholders promises that the tax act would boost investment have not panned out corporate investment is now at lower levels than before the act passed according to the commerce department though employment and wages have increased it is hard to separate the effect of the tax act from general economic improvements since the 2008 recession the boost in stock prices however was predictable as the bill was reaching its final stages in 2017 bryan rich the ceo of logic fund management a wealth advisory company wrote that the proposed corporate rate cut will go right to the bottom line of companies popping eps and driving stocks even higher those benefits mainly went to the rich as the wealthiest 10 percent of americans own 84 percent of all stocks the 10 richest republicans in congress in 2017 who voted for the tax bill held more than 731 million in assets almost two thirds of which were in stocks bonds mutual funds and other instruments

financial disclosure forms they also owned a blind trust worth between 1 million and 5 million congressional financial disclosure forms do not require members to report the precise value of assets and

would shepherd the tax bill through his committee hatch said the national debt crisis poses a significant and growing threat to the economic and national security of this country his concern over national security lasted two months in april hatch signaled he was open to a republican tax bill that would likely add to the national debt when republicans passed the tax bill in december 2017 he

law decreed that future foreign profits would not be taxed at high rates and that previously earned profits stashed abroad an estimated 2 7 trillion would be taxed one time at no more than 15 5 percent in 2017 apple was sitting on 250 billion in overseas profits in january 2018 the month after president donald trump signed the tax bill into law the tech behemoth and third largest american company said it would pay the new lower tax and start bringing the cash home just four months later apple said it would buy back 100 billion of its stock and hike its dividend by 16 percent apple shares increased almost 9 percent by the week s end in april 2019 apple announced 75 billion more in buybacks a move analysts said would likely drive its stock price higher a day after the announcement shares increased in value nearly 5 percent the stock continued to hit record highs late last year that increase and higher dividends augmented the holdings of 43 republicans who voted for the tax bill including seven senators and their spouses who owned apple stock in 2018 john hoeven of north dakota david perdue of georgia arizona s jeff flake now retired jim inhofe of oklahoma and the spouses of pat roberts of kansas maine s susan collins and shelley capito of west virginia a spokesperson for hoeven said that he follows senate regulations and reporting requirements sen collins

worth of 15 8 million 14 million of which is in stocks according to roll call in 2018 with his wife perdue owned 100 000 to 250 000 in apple stock he reported the couple sold some of it and received annual dividends and capital gains that year between 15 000 and 50 000 the optics that the tax cuts would boost the prices of stock he owned apparently didn t concern perdue weeks before republicans passed the tax bill fox news host maria bartiromo asked perdue if he was worried that the corporate cuts would result in buybacks and increased dividends instead of new jobs well maria he answered i come from the school that you know all of the above is acceptable this is capitalism he later added that it was all about capital flow whether for jobs economic growth or dividends an affinity for small business and pass throughs passing a law that helped fuel increases in stock prices wasn t the only way republicans enriched themselves the new law also contained a 20 percent deduction for income from so called pass through businesses a provision called the crown jewel of the act by the national federation of independent businesses a lobbying group pass throughs are single owner businesses partnerships limited liability companies known as llcs and special corporations called s corps most real estate companies are organized as llcs trump owns hundreds of them and the center for public integrity s analysis found that 22 of the 47 members of the house and senate tax writing committees in 2017 were invested in them pass throughs can be found in any industry they pay no corporate taxes and steer their profits as income to business owners or investors who are taxed only once at their individual rates despite their favored treatment as a business vehicle the 2017 tax act did them another favor it allowed 20 percent to be deducted off the top of the pass through income for tax purposes in the senate the champion for the pass through break was ron johnson a wisconsin republican who was a budget committee member when the tax bill was being written he argued that because the bill was slated to give big corporations a 14 percent cut in their tax rate smaller businesses should get a break too i just have in my heart a real affinity for these owner operated pass throughs he told the new york times when the senate was considering the tax bill in november 2017 no doubt johnson with his wife held interests that year in four real estate or manufacturing llcs worth between 6 2 million and 30 5 million from which they received income that year between 250 000 and 2 1 million according to his financial disclosure form how much money lawmakers will pocket from the 20 percent pass through deduction can t be determined without an examination of their tax returns there are limits on how much of the deduction can be taken based on total income and business category but in some cases the tax savings could run into the tens of thousands of dollars johnson declined to comment for this article and while the provision did help small businesses in certain favored categories the benefits of the pass through deduction are heavily tilted toward the wealthy sixty one percent of the benefits of this provision will go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers in 2024 according to the joint committee on taxation the congressional agency that analyzes tax bills gop real estate owners make out big besides the law s benefits to real estate pass throughs real estate in general was hugely favored by the tax law allowing property exchanges to avoid taxation the deduction of new capital expenses in just one year versus longer depreciation schedules and an exemption from limits on interest deductions if you are a real estate developer you never pay tax said ed kleinbard a former head of congress s joint committee on taxation members of congress own a lot of real estate public integrity s review of financial disclosures found that 29 of the 47 gop members of the committees responsible for the tax bill hold interests in real estate including small rental businesses llcs and massive real estate investment trusts reits which pay dividends to investors the tax bill allows reit investors to deduct 20 percent from their dividends for tax purposes real estate pass throughs got an especially sweet gift in the form of a provision inserted into the tax bill behind the closed doors of the house senate conference committee the senate bill under consideration based a company s pass through deductions on the total amount of wages paid to employees because real estate pass through companies typically have few employees however this meant they could offer only tiny deductions to investors a stroke of the pen fixed that someone changed the law to allow real estate companies to use the value of their assets in addition to the size of their payrolls to calculate pass through benefits because such companies can hold sizable assets suddenly they too could offer the full 20 percent deduction to investors in my judgment it was a big giveaway to the real estate community and they are very good lobbyists said steve rosenthal a senior fellow at the nonpartisan urban brookings tax policy center in washington dc that giveaway contributed to last year s record 1 02 trillion federal revenue shortfall one republican senator who benefited from the last minute provision was tennessee s bob corker who at the time owned or was a partner in 18 real estate businesses llcs and partnerships records show his reported income from them was between 2 1 million and 11 1 million in 2017 corker who retired in 2018 told public integrity he had nothing to do with the provision or the 20 percent pass through deduction it was all ron johnson s idea corker said the budget deficit is going up so that people like ron johnson and bob corker can pay less in taxes said hauser of the revolving door project forbidding self dealing would help close the loopholes republicans wouldn t have had many of these apparent conflicts if elizabeth warren s anti corruption plan had been in effect much of the plan was pulled from her anti corruption and public integrity act which she introduced in the senate in 2018 among its provisions the bill would forbid lawmakers to own or trade individual stocks bonds commodities hedge funds derivatives or complex investment vehicles members would be required to put their assets in widely held investment vehicles such as mutual funds warren and her husband were invested in 20 mutual funds in 2017 but no individual stocks members could no longer own commercial real estate though they could keep businesses with revenue under 5 million which could include a lot of pass throughs warren s bill hasn t moved out of the senate finance committee an identical bill in the house also remains idle warren s plan faces an uphill climb even among democrats it s very difficult to get congresspeople to pass rules that make life exceedingly difficult for themselves said beth rotman the money in politics and ethics director at common cause a government watchdog in washington dc but it s happened in the past in 1978 congress passed the ethics in government act in the wake of the watergate scandal it requires certain government officials including members of congress to file annual financial forms records the center for public integrity used for this analysis and in 2012 congress passed a bill that made it unlawful to use insider information to trade stocks required members to report stock trades within 45 days of the transaction and required lawmakers to file disclosure forms online in a searchable sortable and downloadable database so conflicts of interest would be easy to detect within a year congress had removed the searchable and sortable language from the law the financial disclosures are now available online but they are not easily searched or sorted apparently just because of disclosure stock trading by senators dropped by about two thirds in the three years following the law s enactment according to a study by craig holman at the government watchdog group public citizen but holman said he found that some senators continued to trade in stocks in the very businesses they oversaw in their committees a practice public citizen wants banned ironically it was congress that passed laws that restrict other federal government officials from owning stocks or assets that would benefit from the officials decisions or require them to recuse themselves from such decisions yet congress has not passed legislation that bans itself from the same practice congress should have the same rules put on them that the executive branch has said rotman of common cause the executive branch conflict of interest rules are stronger for the 2017 tax act holman of public citizen notes that about six years ago researchers found that more than half of the members of congress were millionaires they are passing tax laws and legislation that disproportionately favors the wealthy class holman said and that means they personally benefit from this type of legislation and from what we ve seen especially from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 he added that tax bill clearly favored the very wealthy over the rest of americans and that means it

this article was published in partnership with vox introduction when the price of apple stock hit a then record high in october 2018 among the shareholders counting their gains were 43 republicans in congress who collectively owned as much as 1 5 million worth of the tech giant s shares apple s stock jumped 37 percent in its run up to that record several variables were behind the climb including higher than expected earnings but congressional republicans themselves had a hand in the spike stock analysts say legislation they championed the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act doled out nearly 150 billion in corporate tax savings in 2018 alone one effect a big boost in stock prices cutting tax rates for companies like apple and hundreds of other stocks they own was one of many ways republican lawmakers enriched themselves after they passed the tax law according to a center for public integrity analysis of the 186 page law and members financial disclosure forms democrats also stood to gain from the tax bill though not one voted for it all but 12 republicans voted for the tax bill as part of the bill republicans approved tax breaks in 2017 for seven classes of assets many of the wealthier members of congress held at the time including partnerships small corporations real estate and several esoteric investment vehicles while they sold the bill as a package of business and middle class tax cuts that would not help the wealthy the cuts likely saved members of congress hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes collectively while the corporate tax cut hiked the value of their holdings it feels to me like a kleptocracy said jeff hauser director of the revolving door project at the center for economic and policy research a left leaning think tank in washington d c such congressional self enrichment has been thrust into the 2020 presidential campaign democratic candidate sen elizabeth warren has said her first priority as president would be to pass an anti corruption package that among other things would forbid members of congress from owning individual stocks bonds and other securities so they could not benefit from tax or financial laws they passed under current law members of congress can trade stocks and then use their powerful positions to increase the value of those stocks and pad their own pockets warren wrote in a september medium post cut taxes get paid two years after the passage of the trump tax act its effects some obvious some hidden are coming into focus one is its cost contrary to republican claims the law is not paying for itself and is likely to burden the nation with an additional 1 9 trillion in debt over 11 years beginning in 2018 according to the congressional budget office and while the law cut tax rates for people of all income brackets some of its tax benefits overtly favored the wealthy such as the 2 6 percentage point tax rate cut in the highest bracket and the doubling of the estate tax exemption to 11 2 million other provisions were subtler yet favored the wealthy even more tax breaks for their investments for instance or changes that boosted the value of their stocks among the rich beneficiaries are members of congress more than half of whom were found to be millionaires in 2014 the tax law s centerpiece is its record cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent at the time of its passage most of the bill s republican supporters said the cut would result in higher wages factory expansions and more jobs instead it was mainly exploited by corporations which bought back stock and raised dividends in 2018 stock buybacks exceeded 1 trillion for the first time ever according to trimtabs an investment research firm net corporate dividends reached a new high in 2018 of more than 1 3 trillion nearly 6 percent more than the previous year the result analysts say the buybacks boosted stock prices and bigger dividends put even more money in the pockets of stockholders promises that the tax act would boost investment have not panned out corporate investment is now at lower levels than before the act passed according to the commerce department though employment and wages have increased it is hard to separate the effect of the tax act from general economic improvements since the 2008 recession the boost in stock prices however was predictable as the bill was reaching its final stages in 2017 bryan rich the ceo of logic fund management a wealth advisory company wrote that the proposed corporate rate cut will go right to the bottom line of companies popping eps and driving stocks even higher those benefits mainly went to the rich as the wealthiest 10 percent of americans own 84 percent of all stocks the 10 richest republicans in congress in 2017 who voted for

e very so often a right leaning economist raises the alarm about the apparently parlous state of america s public finances the subject gripped washington in the early 2010s but has since been mostly disregarded at 78 of gdp america s net public debt is high if not yet huge thanks to president donald trump s tax cuts the federal deficit will exceed 4 of gdp this year a level that is more typical after economic slumps than in the benign conditions seen today with unemployment at 3 6 what is more unless taxes go up or spending on pensions and health care for the elderly is contained public debt will rise to 92 of gdp in 2029 the highest since 1947 and go on rising for decades more according to official projections listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element such warnings have fallen on deaf ears not just in washington but on wall street too financial markets hungry for dollar denominated safe assets betray no concern about america s debts the risk of a crisis is not the only theoretical downside to public borrowing but the others are looking unconvincing for example the argument that debt is crowding out private investment is hard to sustain when firms are awash with cash and can borrow at extremely low rates in january olivier blanchard a former chief economist of the imf told the annual meeting of the american economic association that there were many reasons to doubt the supposed costs of public debt since then jason furman and larry summers of harvard university both of whom advised barack obama on economics have written in foreign affairs a journal that it is time to kill off the debt obsession a flurry of commentators have since declared that economists are fundamentally rethinking their ideas about fiscal policy that is an overstatement the central observation of fiscal doves is that interest rates are very low by historical standards and are not expected to rebound any time soon as a result though debt has grown as a share of gdp interest payments are near their historical average see chart most important rates are lower than the nominal growth rate of the economy that is before adjusting for inflation in such circumstances a debt will shrink as a share of gdp over time if the economy grows faster than interest builds up the government could run a small deficit for ever economists find that weird their theories say that budgets must balance in the long term but mr blanchard gave his lecture after realising that in america nominal growth outpacing the interest rate is the historical norm he thinks that will continue he also gave a reason not to worry about crowding out low rates could be signalling that the risk adjusted return to capital loosely speaking what the economy eventually gains from additional private investment is also low as a result even if government debt does displace investment society may not lose much according to mr furman and mr summers the fear that government debt is discouraging private investment is based on an absurd diagnosis of today s economic problems the real issue they say is that america s interest rates might again fall to near zero at which point the federal reserve could not lower them any further any attempt to cut debt and deficits today might weaken the economy and bring that constraint into view in a recent paper with lukasz rachel of the bank of england mr summers argues that deficits have been propping up interest rates since the 1970s slowing what would otherwise have been a more marked decline not all of this is as new as it seems in 1998 laurence ball of johns hopkins university and douglas elmendorf and gregory mankiw of harvard university observed that america s nominal growth tends to exceed its interest rates they argued that exploiting this condition could pay off most of the time but came with a small risk of provoking a crisis in 2017 mr elmendorf and louise sheiner of the brookings institution a think tank argued in the journal of economic perspectivesthat a glut of saving and falling returns to capital were making government debt less harmful mr summers has been calling for bigger deficits to fund spending on investment for years fearing secular stagnation permanently weak private sector demand nonetheless his essay with mr furman recommends that most new spending is paid for an impeccably conventional idea that was written into congressional rules in 1990 today s rethink is gaining attention for several reasons one is mr blanchard s stature and past job the imf has long been associated with austere fiscal policy another is growing curiosity about modern monetary theory mmt a fringe economic doctrine which holds that debt to gdp ratios are irrelevant in countries that issue their own currency and that the only constraint on spending is inflation left wing democrats who want to spend hell for leather on a green new deal to fight climate change and cut inequality sometimes appeal to mmt as inflation is low today but the theory has scant support among mainstream economists mr furman and mr summers both recently signed a letter recommending that climate change be fought with a carbon tax an approach that most green new dealers pooh poohed ripping up the textbook it may be harder to find economists who back harsh austerity to shrink debts rather than merely to contain them but few of today s politicians display much of an appetite for belt tightening in an age of populism unfunded tax cuts and the green new deal even economists increasingly nuanced views on the balance between tax and spending will probably land them on the hawkish side

financial assistance to the protest hit country the mounting pressure comes as lebanon is grappling with a dire economic and financial crisis the worst since the 1975 90 civil war that has shaken confidence in banks and raised concerns over its ability to repay one of the worldâ s highest levels of public debt diab formed a 20 member cabinet tuesday just over a month after his appointment as premier on dec 19 his government has been widely rejected by protesters and opposition politicians as â one sided â as it is only made up of ministers supported by hezbollah the amal movement the free patriotic movement and their allies this has raised concerns about the governmentâ s ability to drum up the international support needed to avert a much feared economic collapse the international support group for lebanon joined france britain and the european union in calling for enacting reforms in lebanon the isgl urged diabâ s government to adopt a policy statement with the â necessary substantial credible and comprehensive policy package of measures and reforms that can address the demands of the lebanese people â in a statement released thursday night the isgl said diabâ s governmentâ s â timely and decisive implementation will be essential to stopping and reversing the deepening crises facing the country and its citizens â the isgl brings together the united nations the governments of china france germany italy russia the united kingdom and the united states along with the eu and the arab league the statement recalled that lebanonâ s economy and its population â in the absence of reform remain reliant on external funding and are vulnerable to increased hardships â the 2020 budget should be passed immediately the group said adding that the â electricity reform plan reforming state owned enterprises and passing and implementing effective procurement lawsâ were all needed once reform measures are implemented in lebanon the isgl said it would support lebanon and that this would start to rebuild confidence in the economy among lebanese and the international community and â help facilitate sustained international support â as for the nationwide anti government protests taking place since oct 17 the isgl reaffirmed the need for â internal stability and the right to peaceful protest to be protected â the united nations special coordinator for lebanon jan kubis said after a meeting with diab friday that he felt â seriousness and positive signalsâ from the prime minister about implementing reforms asked about his trust in the new government kubis told reporters after the meeting with diab at the grand serail â letâ s wait for the statement but i heard good and positive messages during our talks on fighting corruption this is very important â â the first step lebanon must take is reforms reforms and reforms break the previous practices of corruption and adopt transparency and confidence â he added meanwhile a ministerial committee tasked with drafting the cabinetâ s policy statement held two meetings under diab at the grand serail friday diab stressed the need for drawing up a road map for the government through the policy statement that â should avoid linguistic complications and contradictory interpretations â â people are waiting for us to act therefore the statement must not contain empty promises or suggest to the lebanese people that all is well â diab said according to information minister manal abdel samad najd who spoke to reporters after the two meetings â we must adopt facts and realities in the statement and to commit only to what we can implement so that the policy statement will not be just ink on paper â diab said he called on ministers to study and outline the files of their ministries with transparency based on the â demands of the lebanese and the protest movement â declaring the governmentâ s intention to restore internal and external confidence diab according to abdel samad said â we are facing a test to gain internal and external confidence the statement will be implemented this time there is seriousness in work â according to the law the committee still has 28 days left to finalize the policy statement abdel samad said but she added that ministers were working quickly to finish drafting the statement well before this period the policy statement is essential for the government to seek a vote of confidence from parliament headed by diab the committee which includes the deputy prime minister and defense minister the ministers of finance foreign affairs justice economy environment information youth and sports telecoms industry social affairs and minister of state for administrative reform will meet again saturday separately parliament will vote next week on the draft state 2020 budget that projects a deficit of 7 percent of gdp the head of parliamentâ s finance and budget committee mp ibrahim kanaan said friday far larger than the 0 6 percent originally planned as multiple crises batter the countryâ s finances
president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers broadman said it s not clear to me what the actual economic impact will be as a dispute resolution measure to threaten china with more tariffs
cambridge we have suddenly arrived at a tricky stage in global economic development emerging markets are losing their dynamism after a remarkable three decade long run during which they caught up rapidly with advanced economies moreover rekindling this vigor requires a new economic strategy but where will such a model come from and who will provide the intellectual leadership the latest economic forecasts from the international monetary fund and the world bank are sobering pointing to protracted slowdowns across the board in china india sub saharan africa and latin america of course alarmism about the end of growth might be as overblown as past hype about emerging markets unstoppable rise but policymakers in developing countries are genuinely concerned and are grappling with how to revive flagging dynamism in the past governments had a ready intellectual solution the so called washington consensus a term coined by john williamson of the peterson institute for international economics which advocated a broad strategy of macroeconomic stabilisation privatisation deregulation and globalisation some questioned whether and to what extent the strategy worked but the fact is there was a template created by leading western academic and policy institutions that was seen as useful by developing country policymakers and the high noon of the washington consensus coincided with developing countries strong performance two of the current strands of thought that might replace the washington consensus also originated in the west the first represents a reaction against the neoliberal approach and is motivated by several disturbing long run trends weak growth rising inequality an increasingly beleaguered middle class and collapsing social mobility this emerging post neoliberal consensus questions the primacy accorded to markets it advocates a larger role for the state both to generate better market outcomes for example via minimum wage increases and stricter enforcement of antitrust policies and to correct inequitable outcomes via aggressive redistributive policies this approach also calls for more proactive fiscal and monetary policy in the short run the second strand of thought is associated with abhijit banerjeeand esther duflo both winners of the 2019 nobel prize in economics banerjee and duflo argue that economic growth is not really influenced by policy changes or at least not in ways for which we have strong evidence they therefore advocate a strategy of going small focusing on measures such as distributing free malaria bed nets and deworming children that clearly seem to be effective and will produce localised benefits but it is not obvious that either approach is of much help to developing countries the post neoliberal consensus almost entirely reflects concerns in advanced economies secular stagnation and unconventional monetary policies are not high priority problems for governments in poorer countries moreover emerging markets are still growing not stagnating and even inequality which is a common concern takes a very different form and requires very different solutions in developing economies perhaps the biggest drawback of the post neoliberal approach is the dichotomy that it poses or perhaps presupposes between states and markets the reality in developing countries is that both states and markets are weak the very definition of underdevelopment so a policy agenda that focuses on increasing the role of the state may well be unrealistic in addition climate change is a new and critical aspect of the post neoliberal consensus that is likely to prove increasingly problematic on one hand the overwhelming scientific evidence of global warming is a clarion call to action on the other hand policies aimed at promoting rapid decarbonisation raise deep concerns in developing countries because such measures could easily clash with the needs of their energy deprived citizens similarly many developing country policymakers simply cannot afford the luxury of a narrow agenda making them unlikely to take seriously any advice to focus on the small and certain they have no choice but to strive to achieve rapid growth which has been a prerequisite for all successful development transitions moreover the experience of the 1980s and 1990s shows that this objective is not a chimera and that growth can indeed be increased by appropriate policy reforms mahatma gandhi famously said i do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed i want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible but i refuse to be blown off my feet by any do developing countries today have the capacity not to be blown off course do policymakers have the intellectual and cognitive wherewithal to absorb and assess the new thinking on economic development adopting what is appropriate to their situation and rejecting what is not and do they have their own new ways of thinking about the development challenge consider the situation in the two largest developing countries china and india china has the intellectual capacity but is facing the breakdown of its economic model chinese policymakers now need to find another approach that both encourages growth and ensures that the communist party of china remains in control all the while preventing the extraordinary build up of debt from triggering a crisis it is not obvious to anyone how they can do this meanwhile india s current inward economic turn appears to reflect a broader inclination to be walled in and prevent foreign winds from blowing freely and this intellectual nativism seems to be more about harnessing technical expertise for political objectives than about valuing it for its own sake what is clear is that solutions to the new growth and development challenges in emerging markets will have to be indigenous rather than coming from western institutions building and maintaining among national policymakers the sort of open self confident intellectual capacity that gandhi espoused could well be the next development challenge arvind subramanian a former chief economic adviser to the government of india is a non resident senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a visiting lecturer at harvard s john f kennedy school of government he is the author of

new york at the annual meeting of the american economic association aea in early january former us federal reserve chair janet yellen former european central bank president mario draghi and eminent economists warned that western economies risked japanification a future of sluggish growth low inflation and perpetually low interest rates yet surprising as it may seem this malaise also threatens east asia hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan once called the asian tigers now face slow growth and disinflationary pressures last year hong kong s economy contracted by 1 2 per cent while the other three grew only modestly singapore by 0 6 per cent and south korea and taiwan by about 2 per cent each inflation in each of these three countries was about 0 6 per cent east asia s economies suffered from weaker external demand a result of slow growth in major industrialised countries and china as well as domestic structural and supply factors moreover their growth potential is trending downward economically and demographically these east asian countries seem to be tracking japan for starters japan is the world s most rapidly aging society with 28 per cent of its population aged 65 and above up from 14 per cent in 1994 this age cohort s share of the population in hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan now averages about 14 per cent and is forecast to increase rapidly in the coming decades a shrinking workforce will in turn reverse the demographic dividends that previously supported strong regional growth in south korea for example average annual gdp growth between 2020 and 2040 is forecast to be about one percentage point lower than now moreover like japan in recent decades the four east asian economies are experiencing slowing productivity growth their export industries have encountered fierce competition from low cost chinese firms while low service sector productivity hampers overall productivity improvements and because these countries are already at the high tech frontier they may find it harder to develop new technologies in the future how east asia s policymakers respond to these challenges will be crucial many economists believe that the bank of japan s timid response to the collapse of the country s real estate bubble 30 years ago aggravated the economy s woes leading to the lost decades that followed mindful of this precedent the fed and the ecb have aggressively cut interest rates and injected large amounts of liquidity since the 2008 financial crisis as has the boj under prime minister shinzo abe s administration speaking at the aea meeting former fed chair ben bernanke expressed confidence in central banks ability to provide further economic stimulus using new policy tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance but many economists are sceptical as former us secretary of the treasury lawrence summers has noted leading central banks have failed to meet their inflation targets despite massive monetary expansion and with interest rates already at record lows it will be difficult to resolve the next crisis with further aggressive rate cuts furthermore monetary easing alone cannot tackle major structural economic weaknesses summers for example argues that excessive saving and low investment in industrialized economies could result in secular stagnation mohamed el erian emphasises structural disinflationary forces such as aging rising inequality and a loss of trust in institutions while economists including robert j gordon highlight slower productivity growth given their significant structural problems therefore east asia s economies cannot avoid the japanification solely by loosening monetary policy in fact such measures might even do more harm than good over time although these economies have not experienced an asset bubble collapse like japan continued monetary easing could pose such a risk over the last year the hong kong monetary authority and the bank of korea have cut their policy rates several times to 2 per cent and 1 25 per cent respectively benchmark interest rates in singapore and taiwan also remain low at 1 64 per cent and 1 375 per cent respectively as the experience of japan has shown expansionary monetary policy can keep the economy afloat but with asset price bubbles and many zombie like firms to stave off japanification the four east asian economies should adopt a comprehensive set of policies to overcome their structural weaknesses first governments should spend more on productivity enhancing infrastructure technologies and education in order to boost potential growth such public investment in productive sectors could complement weak private demand and expand supply capacity governments could finance this increased spending by issuing low interest rate bonds but they must avoid an excessive build up of public debt especially the share owed to foreign investors without an international reserve currency too much debt could trigger a default and foreign exchange crisis second east asian governments must address the issues of population aging and a shrinking workforce they need to encourage higher labor force participation among women and seniors boost worker productivity through lifelong education and skills training and allow active migrant inflows expanding access to childcare and providing flexible working arrangements would help to raise fertility rates and governments must tackle inefficiencies in both the financial sector and regulatory policies in order to improve productivity growth finally east asia s governments must focus on increasing economic and social equality and bolstering public trust in institutions despite japan s prolonged economic stagnation its society has remained harmonious and stable providing a solid foundation for managing stable growth in east asia however rising economic inequality amid weak growth is eroding public confidence in political institutions the civil disturbances that have rocked hong kong and south korea over the last year are evidence of this without strong public trust and confidence the next economic calamity whether a japan style slowdown or another financial crisis could prove difficult to overcome the risk of japanification is clear and not only in western europe faced with this threat east asia s aging tigers must take urgent steps to regain their vitality lee jong wha professor of economics and director of the asiatic research institute at korea university was a senior adviser for international economic affairs to former president lee myung

results on slide 3 after the close of the market yesterday evening we reported results for our fiscal first quarter of 2020 we achieved record quarterly revenue of 852 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of 780 million to 820 million this revenue represents 11 growth over the comparable period in fiscal 2019 and 5 growth sequentially our healthcare life sciences sector exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter as our team responded to increased demand from several customers in addition our industrial commercial sector produced exceptional results as we capitalized on further strengthening in the semiconductor capital equipment market and broad improvements in demand throughout the remainder of the sector we delivered gaap eps of 1 03 including 0 17 of stock based compensation expense and non gaap eps of 1 both exceeded our guidance range which was 0 87 to 0 97 the non gaap result excluded a net 0 03 benefit due to special tax items our global teams continue to prioritize operational excellence and through that focus delivered fiscal first quarter operating margin of 4 7 at the midpoint of our guidance range and within our target range of 4 7 to 5 please advance to slide 4 next i will discuss additional accomplishments within the fiscal first quarter of 2020 i will start with items associated with the balance sheet we continue to make progress on our working capital initiatives in the fiscal first quarter we ended the quarter at 87 days of inventory representing an 18 day improvement from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 our inventory performance coupled with improved receivables days and payables days led to a cash conversion cycle of 71 days our cash cycle is down 18 days over the past two quarters the end result was another exceptional quarter of free cash flow we delivered 61 million of free cash flow in the fiscal first quarter this follows a result of 92 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019 we created meaningful shareholder value and delivered return on invested capital of 14 7 this result represents an economic return of 590 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital of 8 8 and exceeds our target of 500 basis points next i will highlight accomplishments related to our revenue growth despite having been impacted by award timing around the holidays our teams delivered 167 million of manufacturing wins within the fiscal first quarter our healthcare life sciences team had another particularly strong quarter with 85 million in wins predominantly with existing customers due to our capabilities and proficiency at delivering exceptional quality products the continued strong wins performance positions our healthcare life sciences sector for an excellent fiscal 2021 our wins momentum which we define as trailing four quarter wins divided by trailing four quarter revenue remains above our target of 25 this level is sufficient to maintain solid growth within our differentiated markets in addition our teams reported a funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities of 2 5 billion which is a reflection of the diligence and strategic focus of our global market sector teams we expect to leverage this funnel to deliver a strong wins result in the fiscal second quarter our industrial commercial sector is exploiting portfolio diversification program ramps and strengthening within the semiconductor capital equipment space to drive outstanding growth our fiscal first quarter revenue was up 42 from the comparable period in fiscal 2019 our aerospace and defense sector continues to show signs of another exceptional growth year our fiscal first quarter results represented 41 year over year revenue growth our focus on 0 defects and perfect delivery resonates with customers in these highly complex markets please advance to slide 5 our portfolio continues to differentiate plexus from our peers as we strengthen our leadership in highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments within the fiscal first quarter 93 of our revenue was generated from the combined healthcare life sciences industrial commercial and aerospace and defense market sectors this position has increased from 79 just three years ago during a period of significant revenue growth our focus in these complex markets provides advantages in operational efficiency and results in more consistent reliable performance for our customers advancing to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2020 on slide 6 we expect revenue to moderate in the fiscal second quarter as we believe some of the fiscal first quarter strength is impacting current quarter demand particularly in our healthcare life sciences sector we expect continued strength in our industrial commercial and aerospace and defense business with revenue relatively flat within these sectors as compared to the strong results of the previous quarter as a result of these factors we are guiding revenue in the range of 790 million to 830 million our operating margin is being impacted by seasonal payroll costs which we estimate at about 50 basis points and the pause of two substantial programs in our engineering organization as such we are guiding operating margin in the range of 4 to 4 5 we anticipate revenue and operating margin at these levels will lead to gaap eps in the range of 0 80 to 0 90 including 0 21 of stock based compensation expense and excluding any nonrecurring charges we are proactively responding to the engineering program pauses by strategically repositioning our boulder design center to co locate with our existing manufacturing facility in boise idaho this opportunity will allow for the creation of an aerospace and defense center of excellence this combination of engineering and manufacturing services will provide the synergies and cost advantages of a campus environment while delivering a compelling service offering for our customers in the aerospace and defense sector our boise manufacturing facility is rapidly growing its aerospace and defense business and is also home to our microelectronics center of excellence please advance to slide 7 for a few thoughts regarding fiscal 2020 our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains generally unchanged from previous expectations we anticipate sequentially increasing revenue during the second half of the fiscal year as we benefit from our recent wins performance largely stable end markets and improving semiconductor capital equipment demand resulting in solid revenue growth for the fiscal year we are enthused with the outlook for our aerospace and defense and industrial commercial sectors where we expect robust growth in addition we anticipate fiscal 2020 revenue in the combined healthcare life sciences industrial commercial and aerospace and defense sectors to exceed 90 of our portfolio consistent with our fiscal first quarter results these sectors have programs with longer life cycles in many cases 10 years or more we have achieved compounded annual growth rates in the teens within these markets our goal is to maintain these growth rates as we move beyond fiscal 2020 coupling the anticipated fiscal 2020 growth with our comprehensive service offerings focus on operational excellence aligned cost structure and talented workforce committed to delighting our customers we expect solid operating performance with return to operating margins within our target range of 4 7 to 5 in the second half of the year this level of performance would enable robust eps expansion for the full fiscal year i will now turn the call over to steve for additional analysis of the performance of our market sectors and operations steve steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you todd good morning please advance to slide 8 for a review of our performance by market sector for the fiscal first quarter of 2020 as well as our expectations for the sectors for the second fiscal quarter of 2020 our healthcare life sciences revenue was flat in the fiscal first quarter the result easily surpassed our expectations of a mid single digit decline our customers forecast did not show a seasonal strength as we entered the quarter however 15 of our top 20 customers in the sector increased forecast within the quarter to meet robust calendar year end demand the strong calendar year end shipments is impacting our fiscal second quarter projections we expect approximately a 10 decline for our healthcare life sciences sector in the fiscal second quarter we believe this demand swing is a short term correction and the sector will rebound in the fiscal third quarter revenue in our industrial commercial sector increased 17 for the fiscal first quarter the result was significantly better than our expectations of a low single digit increase although the largest revenue increases were led by our semiconductor capital equipment customers greater demand from 11 of the top 12 customers in the remaining subsectors contributed to the strong growth as we look at the fiscal second quarter we expect that the semiconductor capital equipment subsector will maintain the increased level of demand however we see a modest pullback in some of the other subsectors the net result is that we are anticipating revenue to be flat for our industrial commercial sector in the fiscal second quarter we are in close communication with several of our semiconductor capital equipment customers as there are indications that we may see additional upside to our current forecast for calendar 2020 the obvious questions we re trying to answer is when and how much our aerospace and defense sector was down 1 in the fiscal first quarter the result was slightly lower than our expectations of a moderate increase slightly slower ramps on two programs were the main reason for the lower revenue looking at the fiscal second quarter we expect growth with new program ramps to be offset by modest softness with three aerospace customers as a result we are expecting flat revenue for our aerospace and defense sector in the fiscal second quarter we anticipate that the new program ramps will be largely complete within the quarter and that they will add provide meaningful growth for the sector in the fiscal third quarter our communications sector declined 5 in the fiscal first quarter a result that was below our expectations of flat revenue weaker demand from four of our top five customers was the cause for the decline as we look toward the fiscal second quarter we see continuing softness from customers in the sector as a result we are expecting a mid teens decline in our communications sector for the fiscal second quarter we expect to gain more visibility regarding the calendar 2020 outlook from our communications customers as we progress through this quarter please advance to slide 9 for an overview of the wins performance of the fiscal first quarter we won 30 new manufacturing programs that we expect to generate 167 million in annualized revenue when fully ramped into production we experienced slower than typical decision making during the holiday season which had a negative impact on the wins results in the fiscal first quarter as we look at the fiscal second quarter our wins performance has started very strong and we anticipate a solid result for this quarter our trailing four quarters of wins at almost 450 million yields a win momentum of 26 the result is above our goal and it continues to support our growth strategy please advance to slide 10 for further insight into the wins results by region the americas region had another strong quarter of wins at 89 million in the fiscal first quarter our focus on the design and manufacturing of highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments continues to fuel our growth the americas wins in the quarter included two large robotic assisted medical devices and winning these programs is a clear indication that that strategy is working the apac region wins of 64 million are the result of diverse capabilities the team has developed the wins vary from a small single use medical device that weighs a few ounces to a complex test system that weighs over several hundred pounds these wins illustrate the vast range of expertise plexus has developed for our customers in the differentiated markets we serve the emea region s wins of 14 million highlights the importance of our commitment to operational excellence in the region market share gains in a long term security customer as well as the addition of a new division from a transportation customer are indicators that the dividend from our great execution is growth with our customers please advance to slide 11 for further insight into the manufacturing wins performance by market sector our healthcare life science team had solid wins result of 85 million in the fiscal first quarter that will enable sustained growth for the sector the robotic assisted medical devices and the new single use device program that i highlighted are expected to start adding meaningful revenue in fiscal 2021 the industrial commercial sector produced 44 million of manufacturing wins in the fiscal first quarter the wins included the addition of a new customer who delivers factory automation solutions through the use of robotics and artificial intelligence plexus ability to demonstrate our expertise in the manufacturing of complex electromechanical assemblies was a key differentiator in securing this win the aerospace and defense sector generated 17 million of new wins in the fiscal first quarter just as important as the size of the wins is the duration of the programs one of the larger wins in the quarter includes a program for the c 130j airframe that we expect to build for at least the next 10 years a highlight in the quarter was a visit by two c 130j crews to our neenah manufacturing facility our teams had the opportunity to tour the planes and speak with the crews as you can imagine the crews appreciate our commitment to 0 defects finally our communications sector wins of 21 million included a new customer who provides products that support the infrastructure and wireless connectivity and high speed communications including 5g applications please advance to slide 12 we exited the fiscal first quarter with a robust funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities at 2 5 billion we have the pipeline of new opportunities required to support continued growth the healthcare life sciences funnel continues to be very healthy at 1 5 billion in addition to the size of the funnel the quality of the opportunities are strong we expect the funnel to support robust wins performance in the fiscal second quarter and beyond the industrial commercial sector increased their funnel to 404 million while generating solid wins within the fiscal first quarter the resource investments we made in fiscal 2019 are starting to have a positive effect on the funnel and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal 2020 the aerospace and defense sector grew its funnel by 9 in the fiscal first quarter and we see momentum in the sector continuing to build in addition to having increased opportunities to gain market share with our customers the pipeline of new activities that feeds the funnel is growing steadily a few final comments todd highlighted our decision to relocate our boulder design center to our manufacturing facility in boise idaho in one regard it was a challenging decision as i know some of the team will not be relocating for those colleagues i want to thank you for your dedication and service to plexus during your tenure for the colleagues who will be moving to boise the prospect of creating a full value stream service offering at this site especially for our aerospace and defense customers is exciting plexus has a strong track record of creating differentiated service offerings and i want to thank you for your willingness and commitment to support plexus in establishing this unique capability in boise i will now turn the call to pat for an in depth review of our financial performance pat pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you steve and good morning everyone our fiscal first quarter results are summarized on slide 13 revenue of 852 million was above the top end of our guidance while gross margin of 9 3 was at our midpoint selling and administrative expense of 39 3 million was above our guidance primarily due to higher variable incentive compensation expense as a percentage of revenue sg a was 4 6 sequentially improved by 20 basis points and consistent with our expectations operating margin of 4 7 was at the midpoint of our guidance and within our target operating margin range included in this quarter s operating margin was approximately 60 basis points of stock based compensation expense nonoperating expenses of 5 7 million were slightly above our guidance as a result of foreign exchange losses our gaap effective tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was 10 which included a net benefit of 800 000 related to special tax items recorded during the quarter excluding these items our non gaap effective tax rate was 12 slightly favorable to our guidance range of 13 to 15 gaap diluted eps of 1 03 included 0 03 per share related to the special tax items excluding these items non gaap diluted eps of 1 was above the top end of our guidance primarily due to the strong revenue results turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 14 during the quarter we purchased approximately 91 000 shares of our stock for 6 3 million at an average price of 69 82 per share at the end of the fiscal first quarter we had approximately 40 million remaining under the authorization for the fiscal first quarter we were pleased with our free cash flow results we generated 75 million in cash from operations and spent 14 million on capital expenditures resulting in free cash flow of 61 million we ended the quarter with the strong balance sheet cash of 255 million was sequentially higher by 29 million we also reduced debt under our revolving credit facility by 33 million both improvements were primarily driven by strong cash flow generation at the beginning of the quarter we adopted the new accounting standard for leases the balance sheet impact from adoption was a net addition of 46 million for leased assets and 47 million for leased liabilities in calculating our return on invested capital we are now including the lease liability within average invested capital the impact from this inclusion is a detriment to roic of approximately 35 basis points despite this detriment we were very pleased to deliver 160 basis point improvement to our return on invested capital this quarter compared to our results in fiscal 2019 cash cycle at the end of the first quarter was 71 days a nine day improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter over the past two quarters we have improved our cash cycle by 18 days please turn to slide 15 for details on our cash cycle the nine day sequential improvement was driven by a reduction to our receivable days and an increase to our payable days each improved by six days for receivable days we experienced a better balance of shipments throughout the quarter compared to last quarter where shipments were weighted more toward the third month also with the quarter ending january 4 we have the opportunity for additional collections from customers with a period close of december 31 for payable days we experienced a return to more normalized procurement activity prior to the fiscal first quarter we had a pullback in purchasing in order to improve our inventory management we have now worked through that impact as todd has already provided the revenue and eps guidance for the fiscal second quarter i ll review some additional details which are summarized on slide 16 fiscal second quarter gross margin is expected to be in the range of 8 8 to 9 2 at the midpoint of this guidance gross margin would be approximately 30 basis points lower than the fiscal first quarter todd mentioned the 50 basis point impact from seasonal compensation cost increases of this total 40 basis points will impact gross margin we also expect an impact on gross margin due to program pauses in engineering services a portion of these impacts is anticipated to be offset by lower healthcare costs in the second quarter compared to the fiscal first quarter for the fiscal second quarter we expect sg a expense in the range of 38 million to 39 million at the midpoint of our revenue guidance anticipated sg a would be 4 75 of revenue sequentially up 15 basis points primarily due to the seasonal compensation headwinds fiscal second quarter operating margin is expected to be in the range of 4 to 4 5 which includes 80 basis points of stock based compensation expense the operating margin guidance is exclusive of any restructuring charges related to the strategic reposition of our boulder design center at this point we are still formulating the details and overall charges associated with the plan a few other notes for the fiscal second quarter depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately 15 million slightly higher than the fiscal first quarter nonoperating expenses are expected to be in the range of 4 6 million to 5 million at the midpoint of this guidance these expenses would be sequentially lower by 900 000 primarily due to the absence of foreign exchange losses which were experienced during the fiscal first quarter for the fiscal second quarter we estimate an effective tax rate of 13 to 15 and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 30 million shares our expectation for the balance sheet is for working capital dollars to increase as we ramp new programs during the quarter and begin procuring inventory later this quarter for the anticipated sequential increase in fiscal third quarter revenue based on our revenue forecast we expect this level of working capital will result in cash cycle days of 75 to 79 days for the fiscal second quarter we expect free cash flow around breakeven as we ramp new programs and build inventory we remain focused on sustaining inventory improvements and anticipate generating free cash flow in subsequent quarters for the full year we continue to expect free cash flow in excess of 100 million finally our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 55 million to 70 million with that john let s now open the call for questions questions answers operator thank you and our first question is from shawn harrison from longbow research shawn harrison longbow research analyst good morning everybody just to say i know it s a small piece of the mix and so it s probably not the biggest focus but within the communications i think the old goal was to have that business flat potentially for the fiscal year and with the underperformance last quarter and the decline this quarter maybe if we could get into just what is the incremental weakness there i think the thinking was that it had bottomed out but it clearly hadn t and maybe what could the back half look like is there further deceleration in that business steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer this is steve i can i ll handle that one looking at this quarter i think as you probably know the msos are announcing their first quarter projections today and through the end of next week and i think we ll get a lot more visibility into what their spending is going to be so i think people are hesitant to really start building product in advance of those announcements and so from an architectural standpoint we do see distributed coming up a bit we see a little bit of upside in more of the centralized architecture and so i think people are really trying to figure out what is going to be the winner for the architecture as we go into fiscal 20 and i think that will dictate for us kind of what 20 looks like as i look toward the back half of the year we do see some strengthening and even in q3 the forecast now are basically holding with what we thought but again i think until we see what comes out from the msos and our spending patterns and our customers adjust their forecast where we truly understand what the back half of 20 looks like todd kelsey president and chief executive officer one of the things i d add shawn is that our expectations for the longer term had been for comps to stay flat i think for 20 we always expected it to be down because we face a really big headwind from some of the demand that s dropped from a significant customer within that space going into it as steve had mentioned we have a couple of program ramps that could turn the trajectory of the revenue in a different direction in the back half of the year but we d still expect it to be a single digit sector for us shawn harrison longbow research analyst ok and then as a follow up i mean defense aerospace grew 40 in the december quarter it looks like you have a really bullish outlook for 20 still are you seeing any impact from the production stoppage of the 737 max or is it just that you ve got so many diversified wins that that stoppage is not really impacting the business todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes i think it s the latter shawn i mean it s we have a very diversified portfolio within aerospace i mean the indications on our 737 max program is there s been no impact as of yet but even if there is it will be negligible to our aerospace and defense revenue you won t notice it shawn harrison longbow research analyst all right great congrats on the results todd kelsey president and chief executive officer thank you steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks operator our next question is from matt sheerin from stifel matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst yes thanks and good morning just a question regarding your operating margin guidance for the coming quarter and for the year you re still looking at 4 7 to 5 range for the second half but you did originally guide for the full year are you is that still something that you could achieve or is that at this point really dependent on how the year shapes out todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes i would say it s a bit dependent right now i mean we see the back half of the year as being 4 7 to 5 with a pretty strong likelihood but for the full year i think it remains a little bit as to how we come through this quarter because this quarter is a bit more challenged than we had anticipated but we should be right in that area for the full fiscal year matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst and you re looking for pretty significant growth based on your wins in the second half wins from some of these sectors and i know in the past with some of these programs there s cost related to that which is always a little bit of a squeeze on margins is that factored into your guidance in terms of expectations because you have visibility on those ramps so you can manage those better todd kelsey president and chief executive officer it is yes it is matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst ok and then on the inventory side pretty strong reduction it sounds like you re going to start to build some inventory back up are you seeing any signs of component constraints like you have in previous quarters or are you able to run relatively lean here steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer yes matt this is steve we re not seeing the component constraints we saw in the past i mean there s always an issue here and there that we ll continue to chase but nothing compared to what it was in previous quarters matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst ok thank you very much operator our next question is from jim ricchiuti from needham company jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst good morning just a question on some of the strength you re seeing in the semi cap part of the industrial business you seem to be suggesting that there may be some upside in that area of the business looking out over the balance of the year is that coming from multiple customers and i assume that that s better margin business is that correct steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer so to answer the first part of your question this is steve yes we see a potential for upside in the coming quarters the question is and it s kind of how i stated it is how much and when i think generally speaking across all of the customers they do expect to see upside in the coming quarters it s really been hard to predict when that s going to hit so obviously this quarter was strong that strength is continuing into this quarter but will we see more in the back half of the year is what we re working through so we re working very closely with customers to make sure that from a capacity standpoint and an inventory standpoint we have the right things in place and then in terms of margin profile it varies by customer and by program i mean it s in line with where plexus expectations are so we ll pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jim this is pat i think when we see increased volumes from customers we can gain some fixed cost leverage but to steve s point it doesn t necessarily mean the margins are stronger by customer jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it and just looking at the what you saw in the healthcare life science vertical i m just trying to understand were there some was there some potential unexpected pull ins of business that you might have been anticipating in the fiscal second quarter that benefited you in q1 todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes we did see some pull in that appears to be q1 demand or first calendar quarter demand shifting into the fourth calendar quarter so our q2 shifting into q1 we hadn t seen that as we entered the quarter it didn t appear that our customers were going to show any end of calendar year strength but that changed over the course of the quarter and we do expect it to have an impact on our current quarter jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst and todd that was from multiple customers todd kelsey president and chief executive officer multiple customers yes steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer 15 of the top 20 had upside in the quarter jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst ok got it and just i know you re not giving guidance specific guidance looking out to the fiscal second half but it seems like the there s the potential that your sg a expense going forward is going to be at a slightly higher level is that also partly due to some of the mix changes you re seeing in the business pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer not necessarily jim i think we can hold our sg a to the levels they re at this past quarter was higher because of higher incentive compensation and that was a combination of the strong revenue and the return on invested capital that s what was driving that higher we do have the merit increases this quarter but we typically work through those through productivity improvements so i wouldn t expect it to be any higher than what we re looking at in q2 jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst ok and then you alluded to some pause in the engineering program so i wonder if you could just give a provide a little bit more color on that todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes well we saw a couple of significant programs that paused and i would call them for different reasons and i wouldn t call them indications of any market softening they re pausing because of issues around the customers and one was with a more significant healthcare oem and they re basically taking a closer look at their business case balancing features versus development effort within that program so that s caused them to step back for a bit and others with a more early stage customer that s really looking at their overall business model so we think that there s a reasonable likelihood that both will go forward at some point but right now it s having a near term impact for us jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it and that early stage customers is that also healthcare or is that in your one of your other sectors todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes it is healthcare it is healthcare jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst thank you operator our next question is from paul coster from jp morgan paul coster j p morgan analyst yes thanks for taking the question the manufacturing wins trend has been sort of slightly down over the course of the last few quarters you sound confident that it s going to rebound pretty quickly and i m just wondering what you think the underlying cause might be is it the trade uncertainty and disruptions to supply chains or is there some other reason for this recent trend and its pending reversal steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer yes this is steve i ll handle that one and actually i think i misspoke in the beginning i think i said our trailing four quarters were 450 million it s actually 850 million and so a quick correction on that one but from a trend standpoint i think one of the things that we re analyzing and looking at as we look at the trailing four quarters the healthcare life sciences and aerospace and defense sectors those trailing four quarters the revenue levels for those quarters have been the highest they ve been in the last couple of years and so those programs are a bit smaller but as we re trying to talk about here is the duration of the things that are significantly longer and as we ve basically deemphasized and we see the communications numbers coming down those are historically higher numbers but the program durations were much smaller and so as we look forward we re confident as we re growing in these diversified sectors and todd talked about that over 90 of our revenue is going to be in these diversified sectors that we re generating the wins that we needed to continue to grow and so i think one of the things we need to do is take a look at the metrics that we re using and make sure that now that we have this different portfolio the size of the wins that we need we believe are supporting the business and we ll have to make sure that our metrics are measuring the right thing paul coster j p morgan analyst makes sense you said 15 of the 20 healthcare life sciences customers pulled forward is there an underlying trend to explain that steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer from my perspective if you looked at the beginning of the quarter we actually talked about the fact that we had historically in the past seen some seasonal upside in our fiscal q1 related with the year end demand our customers have not forecasted that as significant as they had in the past and so we didn t know quite frankly if there was going to be softer demand in the q1 in our q1 but as we came through the quarter we realized that that demand was really there and customers needed to pull it in and so we did that for them so i don t know there s much more we can read into it i think the demand was strong at the year end our customers didn t anticipate it we reacted to it and again i think as we look at the forecast going into q3 we think it s going to rebound back to a normal level so we do see it as just a one or two quarter kind of fluctuation paul coster j p morgan analyst last question is so we re seeing a number of companies in this space following your script a bit which is to deemphasize the short product cycle business the volatile business and focus on these long product cycle verticals and also we re seeing some pricing discipline do you concur that there is sort of rational pricing happening in your industry at the moment and how does that play out over the course of time todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes it from our perspective there is rational pricing in the industry right now from a competitive standpoint though we don t see things as being significantly different i mean it s always been competitive in our spaces we ve always kind of competed with the same people that looks rather similar but the pricing situation is i would call it decent right now so that s certainly a positive for all of us i think if we have good pricing discipline and drive to get value out of the services that we re providing pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and paul in some of these complex sectors that we operate within there is higher working capital requirements and so we ve got to make sure the margins support that higher working capital and i think our competitors are thinking the same and focusing on the return on invested capital side and ensuring those margins are high enough paul coster j p morgan analyst thank you operator our next question is from anja soderstrom from sidoti anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst hi everyone congratulations on the great quarter and a lot of good questions asked already i just wanted to follow up on sort of the contract wins how can you bucket that from how much you are winning from existing customers versus winning transferring customers from in house production and maybe also how you are comparing to peers steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer so if i understood your question correctly as we look at our wins in our funnel we traditionally fall from a 60 70 customer to a 30 40 target split both in wins as well as the funnel and our focus varies by sector for example in our healthcare life sciences sector we believe the number of logos and the customers that we have there s a lot of opportunity to continue to harvest from them and support the growth that we need again we re always looking at adding new customers but again they believe they have a strong customer base as we looked at industrial commercial through fiscal 2019 one of the things we recognize is that we needed to add new customers to the portfolio and so they focused that sector focused heavily on doing that and made great progress doing it and so we do look at it by sector but we think that roughly 70 30 60 40 split from customers to targets is a very healthy path forward with us obviously growing with customers is much easier they ramp quicker than it does with targets so we like that mix anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst ok thank you and also you mentioned that you re moving the shifting into the 90 over 90 of your revenue in the healthcare life sciences and aerospace and defense and industrial and commercial so and their life cycles there are much longer can you just remind us how those compare to the communications and how much short are the communications todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes sure we tend to think of the communications as being about a three to five year life cycle on programs and whereas we look at aerospace and defense being in the mid to mid teens to even 20 year life cycle and healthcare and industrial tending to be closer to a 10 year life cycle so it s quite a difference in when you re providing solid execution maintaining the business and the amount of churn that s in the portfolio and the amount of business that you need to win anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst ok that was helpful and also lastly what are you going to do with all the cash pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer good question so we ll continue to buyback we expect to execute that remaining portion of the buyback this year and we are paying down some of our debt and we ll continue to do those two things and then reevaluate we continue to see this level of free cash flow moving forward we ll look at our alternatives around a future buyback or consider the merits of a dividend too anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst ok thank you that s all for me operator and we have a follow up question from jim ricchiuti from needham company jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst the repositioning of the boulder design center at boise i assume that is that something that has been under consideration and in the works for a bit todd kelsey president and chief executive officer it s been under consideration for a bit because we saw the advantages strategically of having an aerospace and defense center of excellence as we see aerospace and defense as a great growth opportunity for our engineering solutions organization and co locating those two facilities made a lot of sense strategically but really the pauses in the engineering programs i guess were the impetus to be able to move forward with it so what we had considered it it s a bit i d call it it s taking or looking at the situation that we have in front of us and addressing it steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer we have started our boulder design center before our boise operations and if you had done it reverse you do exactly what we re doing now which having that center of excellence with the co location and the full value stream is a significantly bigger value add for our customers and so as todd said taking advantage of the situation and making a better long term strategic alignment is the right way to go for us jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it and maybe you guys if you could maybe just remind us as you think about some of your other verticals and to what extent are have you adopted this kind of a strategy in some of the other verticals with these centers of excellence todd kelsey president and chief executive officer well it hasn t necessarily been pegged as centers of excellence but there s a great deal of co location between our engineering facilities and our manufacturing facilities and we found that to be very effective jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it that s it for me thanks a lot operator and we have no further questions at this time i ll now turn it back over to ceo todd kelsey for closing remarks todd kelsey president and chief executive officer all right thank you john and i just wanted to close briefly by thanking everyone who joined our call today we appreciate your support we appreciate your interest

earnings have doubled from 1 a share in 2016 to 2 01 this year and our tangible capital ratio increased from 7 7 at year end 2016 to 11 05 this year clearly our balanced growth strategy has and continues to deliver strong results for shareholders full year adjusted revenue on a fully taxable basis grew by 14 for the year while adjusted noninterest expense grew by only 3 creating tremendous operating leverage reflecting both our continued growth as well as the successful consolidation of offices in late 2018 and a lot of hard work by our team members to streamline processes renegotiate contracts and take greater advantage of our digital capabilities as you saw yesterday we are excited to announce the acquisition of freedom bank operating in the important st pete market on the west

times we remain focused on building out an extremely valuable and irreplaceable franchise throughout the state of florida and we believe our florida acquisition program will continue to play an important role in our balanced growth strategy over the next couple of years we will remain focused on opportunities that strengthen our position in florida s higher growth metro markets including tampa st pete orlando south florida and also helping us continue to build operating leverage i also want to say the outlook for florida and particularly the markets in which we operate remains very strong today chuck will cover more detail in a minute but the final quarter of the year continued to produce just excellent results adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 52 and our adjusted return on average tangible assets stood at 1 57 earnings continued to accrete steady peer leading growth in tangible book value per share and our overall capital position remained steady with a tangible capital ratio of over 11 ranking us among the strongest in the nation our capital returns remain strong with an adjusted return on tangible capital of just under 15 pretty incredible when you consider the size of our capital base looking ahead we remain very confident in our ability to meet our vision 2020 objectives hitting these objectives require us to drive a lot of change into the organization and a great deal of that change is now behind us as we continue to execute our balanced growth strategy we will focus on delivering both strong growth and excellent returns our seacoast team members have worked incredibly hard over the past couple of years to get us where we are today i want to express my sincere appreciation to all of you and my confidence in your ability to continue to lead seacoast to build out this incredible franchise across florida as we continue to execute our balanced growth strategy with that i d like to turn the call over to chuck to review our results in a little more detail and also to talk a little more about our recent acquisition then we d be happy to take a few questions chuck charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you denny and thank you all for joining us this morning as i provide my comments i ll reference the fourth street freedom bank deck in the fourth quarter 2019 earnings slide deck which can be found at seacoastbanking com let s start this morning with the fourth street freedom bank deck last night we announced the acquisition of fourth street banking corporation inclusive of a subsidiary bank freedom bank freedom is a 300 million bank by assets headquartered in st petersburg florida operating two highly profitable branches in the city of st petersburg this acquisition builds upon our two prior end market acquisitions adding two branches and increasing distribution and scale through our position in florida second largest msa seacoast will be the third largest florida based franchise in the tampa st pete clearwater msa and the largest florida based bank in the st petersburg market this acquisition fits our m a strategy being an end market low risk transaction with a very high quality customer franchise and strong credit underwriting we expect this transaction to come together easily with no disruption to our organic growth plan freedom is led by cathy swanson a lifelong st petersburg banker and prior to being ceo of freedom she was an executive with synovus bank cathy will remain with seacoast as market president of pinellas county freedom s high quality loan book has an average loan yield of approximately 5 79 and the majority of the firm s funding is made up of checking savings now and money market accounts representing 74 of deposit funding s noninterest bearing checking represents 33 of the funding and the net interest margin is approximately 4 16 which will be accretive to seacoast nim we expect a full conversion of fourth streets convertible subordinated debt to common equity prior to close the debt has a 4 50 rate and converts at a 1 85 per share which is diluted to fourth street s tangible book value per share and increases the tangible common equity by 10 million the holders can convert the debt any time after december 31 2019 the holders can choose to convert not convert or conditionally convert subject to the deal being approved by shareholders and regulatory authorities we fully expect all holders to convert given it is in their best economic interest to do so and anyone who does not convert will have their debentures redeemed for cash turning to slide 5 under the terms of the merger agreement fourth street shareholders will receive 0 1275 shares of seacoast common stock based on seacoast s closing price on january 22 2020 of 29 39 a share the transaction is valued at approximately 63 6 million or 3 75 per share the deal pricing translates to 1 74 times fourth streets tangible book value inclusive of the subordinated debt conversion and 14 1 times 2020 earnings and 7 4 times 2020 earnings when adjusted for cost saves we expect the acquisition to close late in the second quarter of 2020 after receipt of approvals from regulatory authorities the approval of fourth street shareholders and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions we expect cost outs of 50 plus and will phase these in over the first 120 days after transaction close using the crossover method we expect to tangible book value dilution to be earned back in approximately 1 5 years inclusive of a quarter year impact from cecl and an irr north of 20 similar to our other acquisitions this is an accretive value creating transaction that strengthens our foothold in a key and growing msa given the timing of the close we expect the deal to be 1 5 accretive to earnings in 2020 and 3 3 accretive to earnings in 2021 and when combined with the recently announced first bank of the palm beaches transaction the combined earn back of both deals is less than two years and the combination will be over 5 accretive to earnings in 2021 the assumptions used for modeling were developed following detailed due diligence which included a robust review of freedom bank s credit portfolio due diligence identified a loan mark of 3 12 including a 50 basis point interest rate mark and 81 basis point credit discount mark related to the non pcd loans and 1 82 cecl related alll mark a pre tax loan loss provision of 2 2 million was assumed to be recorded through the income statement to establish a day 1 mark on the non pcd loan portfolio we estimated core deposit intangible of 2 5 taken together our assumptions yield goodwill of a modest 26 million maintaining seacoast s strong tangible common equity ratio now turning to the fourth quarter results and beginning with the highlights on slide 4 of the earnings deck we finished the year with strong results in the fourth quarter with adjusted net income growing 12 year over year to 26 8 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of 0 52 for the full year 2019 adjusted net income was 32 higher than 2018 we reported adjusted return on tangible assets of 1 57 and adjusted return on tangible common equity of 14 2 and as we continue to grow our capital base it s worth mentioning that if in the fourth quarter that if the fourth quarters tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was adjusted to an illustrative target of 8 our adjusted return on tangible common equity would be 20 8 increasing from 20 5 in the prior quarter seacoast s management and board will continue to monitor our capital position and are committed to managing capital prudently to build shareholder value through the economic cycle and we are pleased to report the continued robust build of shareholder value with tangible book value per share growing 20 year over year to 14 76 our focus on growing revenue while streamlining operations is evident in our efficiency ratio which improved 1 5 points sequentially to 47 5 year to date we have generated 11 operating leverage with adjusted revenues increasing 14 percent and adjusted non interest expense increasing 3 and lastly we generated substantial loan growth this quarter and brought deposit cost down by 12 basis points successfully defending our margin turning now to slide 5 net interest income increased 0 8 million sequentially despite a 25 basis point drop in the federal funds rate net interest margin contracted 5 basis points to 3 84 excluding accretion on acquired loans the net interest margin declined only 1 basis point sequentially despite the reduction in rates experienced over the second half of 2019 quarter over quarter the yield on loans contracted 17 basis points the yield on securities contracted 12 basis points and the cost of deposits decreased 12 basis points the declines quarter over quarter were the result of federal reserve rate cuts two in the third quarter and another in the fourth quarter affecting the variable rate portion of our loan and securities portfolio and lower add on rates in commercial mortgage loans we continue to proactively mitigate the impact of rate cuts by remaining disciplined in deposit pricing our strategy has included meaningfully shortened time deposit offerings to maturities of one year or less and moving rates lower on higher yielding savings and money market products other interest bearing liabilities such as our trust preferred and federal home loan bank advances also benefited from falling short term rates while the curve is steep and slightly from the previous quarter the persistent flat rate environment will remain challenging looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020 assuming no changes in the federal funds rate we expect the net interest margin to be in the low 3 80s for the first quarter the guidance of a potential slight decline in margin is the anticipated result of an assumed persistent flat yield curve the impact of purchase loan accretion on the net interest margin though variable was 21 basis points in the fourth quarter and we are modeling approximately 22 basis points in the first quarter of 2020 assuming economic conditions remain unchanged we expect net interest income to expand throughout 2020 primarily the result of growth in the balance sheet moving to slide 6 adjusted non interest income was 13 8 million flat to the previous quarter and grew 1 million or 8 from the prior year mortgage banking fees totaled 1 5 million a bit more subdued from heightened refinance activity in the third quarter but our continued focus on generating saleable volume produced 6 5 million in revenue for 2019 we expect continued improvements in this line item in 2020 the result of continued expansion of the mortgage banking team 2019 was a great year for our wealth management teams with aum growth of 140 million in line with our target and an increase in fees of 0 4 million or 7 year over year we ended the year with 650 million in assets under management service charges on deposits are in line with the previous quarter and interchange income increased 0 2 million sequentially in 2019 interchange income increased by 1 1 million or 9 compared to the prior year and seacoast s debit card program surpassed 1 billion in retail sales the company s debit card program consistently performs in the top quartile of visa partner banks of similar size the gaap presentation of non interest income includes 2 5 million in gains on sales of securities a decision we made to capture significant price appreciation as the 10 year treasury declined significantly early in the fourth quarter moving to slide 7 adjusted non interest expense totaled 36 million declining 0 9 million sequentially and 3 6 million less than the prior year this outperformed our previous guided range of 37 to 38 million for the fourth quarter salaries and employee benefits decreased 1 million on a combined basis the result of lower incentive accruals and our continued proven success in focusing on cost control across the franchise we saw higher claims in health insurance this quarter and increased legal and professional fee expenses associated with the upcoming acquisitions and also during the third quarter of 2019 the fdic announced the achievement of their target deposit insurance reserve ratio resulting in our ability to apply previously awarded credits to our deposit insurance assessment and zero associated expense this quarter the company has a remaining credits of 0 7 million which will be applied to future assessments if the fdic s reserve ratio remains above the target threshold for the first quarter of 2020 we expect adjusted non interest expense to be approximately 40 5 million to 41 5 million excluding the amortization of intangible assets which is approximately 1 5 million per quarter this guidance includes the acquisition of the first bank of the palm beaches which is expected to close in mid march and is presented on an adjusted basis which excludes one time merger related charges we will maintain our disciplined focus on efficiency and expense management and as a reminder the first quarter is impacted by seasonal 401 k payroll tax and the return of incentive compensation expenses the company recorded 8 1 million in income tax expense in the fourth quarter compared to 8 5 million in the prior quarter the third quarter of 2019 was impacted by change in the florida corporate income tax rate which resulted in writedowns of deferred tax assets and a slightly higher resulting rate in the third quarter for the full year 2019 our effective tax rate was 23 2 we model our rate for 2020 at 23 moving to slide 8 i d like to highlight our continued improvements in generating operating leverage with the declining overhead and a focus on growing revenue the adjusted efficiency ratio declined 2 9 sequentially to 48 and the adjusted non interest expense to tangible asset ratio declined to 2 11 we expect our adjusted efficiency ratio to move modestly back above 50 in the first half of 2020 before moving back below 50 during the second half of 2020 the increase in the first half of the year is primarily the result of 401 k payroll tax and other compensation expenses and is in line with the prior year seasonality we remain confident that we are on track to achieve a below 50 efficiency ratio exiting 2020 and beyond and on target with our vision 2020 plan we continue to maintain strict and proactive cost control discipline while ensuring we do not impede on revenue growth turning to slide 9 total new loan production was a record 587 million compared to 488 million in the prior quarter resulting net loan growth in the quarter was 17 on an annualized basis and 8 year over year achieving our stated objective of mid to high single digit loan growth in 2019 commercial originations during the fourth quarter of 2019 were 247 million reflecting strong execution by our teams across the footprint and the addition of key talent over the past year in our fastest growing markets like tampa and broward county our commercial pipeline was 256 million at the end of the quarter an increase of 56 compared to the same quarter in the prior year moving on to the residential category we placed 163 million in the portfolio including the opportunistic purchase of a portfolio totaling 99 million additional production of 62 million was sold in the secondary market the saleable mortgage pipeline exiting the year was up 40 compared to the same quarter in the prior year consumer and small business produced 115 million up 12 million from the prior quarter we are well positioned to continue to drive attractive growth while maintaining our credit discipline as the economic cycle continues to mature for the full year 2020 we expect loan growth of mid to high single digits as we move forward turning to slide 10 deposits outstanding decreased 88 million sequentially and we ended the year with deposit growth of 8 public bond fund balances were seasonally higher and throughout the year we ve continued the successful acquisition of commercial customers with business checking balances growing 9 in 2019 looking ahead to 2020 we maintain our target for deposit growth of approximately 4 to 6 turning to slide 11 rates paid on deposits decreased 12 basis points to 61 basis points we expect deposit cost in the first quarter to be in line with q4 assuming no rate actions taken by the federal reserve noninterest bearing demand deposits represent 28 of the deposit franchise and transaction accounts represents 50 of our deposit book in line with the prior quarter turning to slide 12 credit continues to benefit from rigorous credit selection that emphasizes through the cycle orientation and builds on customer relationships in well understood known markets and sectors as well as maintaining diversity of loan mix the allowance to total loans was up 1 basis point to 68 basis points at quarter end net charge offs for the quarter were 3 2 million or 25 basis points of average loans and for the full year 2019 averaged 16 basis points in line with prior guidance our forward looking expectation for annualized net charge offs is 20 to 25 basis points through the first half of 2020 let me take a moment to remind you that under purchase accounting loans acquired through an acquisition were placed in the acquired loan portfolio and a purchase mark including both characteristics for credit and rate is applied and accreted back through net interest income as these loans pay down or mature at the end of the fourth quarter this discount represents 3 83 of purchase loans outstanding in the non acquired loan portfolio the alll ended the quarter at 80 basis points of loan outstanding down 4 basis points from the prior quarter classified and criticized assets continue to trend favorably we continue to prudently manage our commercial real estate exposure with construction and land development as a percentage of the bank level capital at 40 and commercial real estate loans as a percentage of bank level capital at 204 down from 42 and 204 respectively in the prior quarter and well below regulatory guidance on a consolidated basis construction and land development and commercial real estate loans represent 38 and 191 respectively concentrations continue to be consistently managed with the funded balance of our top 10 and top 20 relationships representing 21 and 39 of total consolidated risk based capital respectively down from 34 and 54 respectively 3 years prior our average commercial loan size is approximately 365 000 nonperforming assets decreased 0 3 million to 39 3 million in the fourth quarter 2019 due to the sale of an reo property classified and criticized assets declined from 3 and 10 of total risk based capital respectively to 3 and 9 of risk based capital period end the provision quarter over quarter reflects strong loan growth in the fourth quarter and a small increase in net charge offs for the quarter looking back over the last four quarters net charge offs were 16 basis points of loans outstanding in line with our expectation reflecting strong asset quality trends turning to cecl we are finalizing our model validation review and while we do not have a final day 1 impact to share we do continue to expect the adoption of cecl will increase our loan loss reserves one reason for the increase is the impact on our purchase loan portfolio we acquired these loans at a discount in the purchase discounts which currently stands at 3 83 accretes into interest income over time the vast majority of our acquired loans were not considered credit impaired at the time of acquisition under cecl that purchase discount no longer shields these loans from getting an allowance so the day 1 impact of cecl will include recording reserve on these loans that s essentially a double counting the credit mark on these loans but that s what the new accounting standard will require us and other banks to do keep in mind that there is no change to the purchase discount and that will continue to be accretive to interest income for purchased unimpaired loans the portfolio of purchased credit impaired loans is only 12 7 million these loans will be treated in newly defined category of pcd purchase credit deteriorated upon adoption there will be an incremental reserve for these loans that also increases the allowance upon adoption and the impact on pci accretion going forward will be nominal turning to slide 13 we continue our commitment to maintaining a fortress balance sheet through the cycle built around strong capital and strict credit underwriting this is served to generate strong capital levels and book value per share growth this is positioning us well for additional disciplined acquisitions and organic growth opportunities in 2020 the tier 1 capital ratio was 15 the total risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio was 15 7 at december 31 2019 the tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 11 1 at quarter end providing ample capital for additional prudent growth using an 8 tce ratio illustratively would imply over 210 million in capital available for deployment and as mentioned earlier implies a 20 8 return on tangible common equity for the quarter seacoast board and management are committed to a prudent capital management to drive shareholder value and to wrap up on slide 14 and 15 we are well positioned to sustain and advance momentum and growth into 2020 since announcing our vision 2020 targets in february 2017 we have achieved a compounded annual growth rate in tangible book value per share of 13 steadily building shareholder value our fundamentals remain very strong with a well capitalized low risk balance sheet and attractive funding and we see continued robust opportunities to enhance our balanced growth strategy in some of florida s fastest growing markets we are on track to meet our vision 2020 targets we remain focused on continuing to create meaningful values for shareholders we look forward to your questions i ll turn the call back to denny dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer thank you chuck and operator we d be pleased to take a few questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from david feaster from raymond james please go ahead david feaster raymond james financial inc hey good morning guys congrats on the deal dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer thank you we re excited about it david feaster raymond james financial inc so you got a pretty full plate here two deals but i believe you ve had as much as three ongoing at the same time are we on pause here near term or would you still be interested in m a at this point and i guess historically you ve converted and closed the same day is that the plan here dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer yes that is the plan here david and just generally conversations remain robust we plan to close the first bank of the palm beaches deal in mid march so that s right around the quarter and one of the benefits of doing small lower risk transaction is we can close and convert them at the same time which we ll do with both these transactions and keep moving down the road so we re still out talking to various opportunities the conversations remain robust and there s still plenty of opportunity to continue our m a strategy as we move forward david feaster raymond james financial inc okay terrific i guess just what do you really expand your st pete presence here how do you think about this market and the opportunities for growth for both loans and deposits as well as new hires dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer yes no i d say great question david and what i would say to you is we ve talked in the past to both research and investors that we love the tampa st pete market it s a tremendous market it s twice the size of orlando and it s the second largest msa in in the state of florida it is full of opportunities for us both in terms of customers and bankers and as we ve done over the past year we ve continued to expand our banker pool in the market and just here in the fourth quarter added across the franchise another seven commercial bankers and another nine mlos so we continue to expand distribution we think the markets are serving as well we continue to see strong population growth in the markets and great opportunities for growth so this gives us the more scale there the team that operates in the st pete market has operated there for many years is well regarded well thought of and is staying on with us and is excited about the opportunity to work with us so i think this acquisition is more than just acquiring a bank there is a great market behind it charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer so as you know david our position in pinellas county was quite small previously we had a very very small amount of exposure there and so as cathy and her team get together and assimilate with our position there it just builds an even stronger presence for her and for her bank in that market and we re really excited about the talent that is coming with that acquisition so very very excited about that also a good support part of shareholders there got grown to really appreciate some of the deep connections they have in the market and so we re really really excited about being in a much stronger position in pinellas county david feaster raymond james financial inc that s terrific guys it s a great bank and a great team charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer now that we re there we hope we can convince raymond james to open up an account with us david feaster raymond james financial inc there you go there you go i appreciate all the color on the guidance but just had a quick one on the loan growth guidance does that assume any additional loan purchases and i guess how do you think about loan purchases supplementing organic growth do you expect and if you do any more purchases do you think it s going to be more on the commercial or the resi mortgage side dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer we had described the purchase strategy it s purely opportunistic we don t count on it if we come across something that makes sense we ll do it in this case the portfolio we purchased in the fourth quarter was something we had been working on with a fairly large regional bank that had a higher loan to deposit ratio they wanted to exit that or reduce that loan to deposit ratio we actually went into that portfolio and hand selected the loans that we took it s an agreement we put together with them so we got a great portfolio so it s purely an opportunistic strategy david david feaster raymond james financial inc that s good that s all from me go ahead dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much thanks david operator our next question comes from steve moss from b riley fbr please go ahead stephen moss b riley fbr inc good morning guys just wanted to follow up on the loan growth questions here perhaps for the quarter here in particular the pipeline in the last quarter was really strong close to 360 million and i guess the pull through didn t seem quite as strong as what i was thinking just curious like what drove that or maybe with some stuff pushed out into next quarter charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer yes it was purely some things pushed into q1 so we had a handful of deals maybe about 10 deals that moved into q1 that would make up the difference there and we ve closed about half of those and expect to close the rest over the coming weeks so it is just purely a timing on closings stephen moss b riley fbr inc okay that s helpful and then just in terms of prepayment activity and pay downs how much is that influencing your loan growth for loan growth expectations for 2020 charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer yes we ve modeled in similar trend to what we experienced in the current year and what we ve seen when you go back and look at payoffs is it s really been rate dependent and rates have come down particularly in long end of the curve we see ba payoffs go up payoffs were actually the highest they ve been all year in q4 so we had to overcome that so we model in a conservative guide around that and expect it to remain just about the same as it s been over the last 12 months stephen moss b riley fbr inc okay that s helpful and then perhaps just a question on capital return i mean obviously you ve been doing acquisitions and that s been a source of capital deployment but just wondering any thoughts around dividend at this point capital still appears to remain strong here charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer yes certainly does remain strong and all i can say is we regularly take a look at our capital position in light of kind of our current and forecasted forecast that we see out there and including opportunities we see for balance sheet growth and the overall operating environment we re comfortable today with the capital levels we maintain we went to great lengths kind of talked about that earlier in our prepared remarks and we just view it as a tremendous asset a tremendous benefit that we carry a long when you look at our credit discipline and our commitment to maintaining really a fortress balance sheet not just in terms of credit but also in terms of capital really puts us in an extremely strong position and we intend to leverage that strong position as we go forward with that large and very robust capital level having said that capital does continue to build and we ll regularly reevaluate that and as we continue to have discussions with our board we ll look at alternatives and make sure we deploy capital prudently as circumstances warrant so stay tuned and if we have something to say we ll certainly be talking about it stephen moss b riley fbr inc all right thank you very much guys dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve operator our next question comes from michael young from suntrust please go ahead michael young suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey good morning dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer hey michael michael young suntrust robinson humphrey inc wanted to ask just qualitatively on any investments that are going on this year i think last year there was the full digital kind of end to end processes of origination that you were working on and some hiring etc i know there were some departures here at the end of the year so can you just talk about maybe some strategic initiatives and where some ongoing investment needs are for this year dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer well i ll just start and say that many of the investments we talked about last year particularly around the digital investments and the like much of that is behind us we have more to continue to kind of complete as we look into 2020 that was always our plan to have that in pretty solid shape as we got into 2020 so we think our investments going forward will be more heavily weighted into some of the growth investments that we see out there and probably as chuck mentioned earlier we continue to hire very aggressively in the markets that we re in and we ll continue to see investments i would say in that area around growth so that s kind of high level what i would say chuck you have any other thoughts charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer no i think that wealth says it well last year we made a fair amount of investment in a full digital end to end commercial origination platform a full pricing model that we acquired as well as investments in our own internally developed platform so we put a lot of more money and work into that over the last year to set ourselves up for growth we re now investing in putting bankers into what we think is a robust platform and looking to expand the markets that s kind of the objective in for 2020 michael young suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay so fair to characterize that it will be more of investment in people and in originators this year versus kind of back end or technology initiatives from last year charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer yes and the only other thing i d say is we as part of our negotiation with our outsource data provider last year which provided a fair amount of benefit to our p l we negotiated a full rework of our digital mobile and online platforms and so late this year we ll work to really enhance the customer experience around our mobile and online platforms and that s all worked into our forward expectations and worked into the cost structure so it s just a matter of implementing that and i think that s going to provide a much better user experience for our customers and so we re pretty excited about that michael young suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and maybe just a couple of ways of asking questions about the nim but first you guys had very significant drop in deposit costs this quarter that was pretty impressive given that you already have a pretty low cost of deposits overall are there incremental opportunities to continue to do that or have you kind of pulled a lot of the levers there already charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer yes i think and it all depends on interest rates and the steepness of the curve but assuming the curve remains flat i d expect deposit cost to remain about where they are for the foreseeable future unless the outlook changes and nim we guided to low 3 80s in q1 assuming the rate curve would remain where it is it s probably would that would also flat line out as we move forward so it s all going to depend on where rates go but i think we can hold the deposit cost about where they are michael young suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and there s no latent pressure on loan yields from here i know you guys are a little less libor since it is cited out there decent incremental roll through throughout the year or you believe you can kind of offset that charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer no i think i think we can offset that and i think that remains relatively flat as well we re pretty well positioned for where we are and the thing that would be most beneficial is some steepness in the curve as you know but we re in pretty good shape i think from a margin and loan and deposit cost perspective we work pretty hard to manage that position to be as effective as possible and position ourselves to be right where we are and feel good about where we are going into 2020 and when you look forward as i mentioned in my prepared comments i think net interest income continues to grow because we position that well as well as we expect growth into the coming year so our forward outlook remains pretty positive michael young suntrust robinson humphrey inc all right congrats on a good year charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you mike operator our next question comes from jeff cantwell from guggenheim securities please go ahead jeff cantwell guggenheim securities llc hi good morning dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer hey jeff jeff cantwell guggenheim securities llc congrats on the results and thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask you if you could drill down a little bit and maybe give us a little bit of color on the new business that you re seeing across both consumer and commercial over the past quarter maybe the past few months really can you just tell us a little bit about the customers you ve been adding and remind us why you think they re choosing seacoast it s always good to get a refresh on why you re winning new business thanks dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer yes no we continue to be very competitive in the marketplace and we benefit tremendously from the population growth that s going on in the economy if you look at the markets we purposely position the franchise in tampa orlando i 4 corridor in south florida there s tremendous growth in those markets tremendous growth in the florida gdp that is helping businesses our core business prospect is generally companies that are in the professional practice space and small manufacturing and the like and those companies are doing incredibly well given what s happening in florida there s a lot of healthcare moving to florida particularly in the population and it just really is supporting growth so the markets are doing well we re getting good inbound customer growth and we re using bankers and marketing and everything you can imagine to make sure that continues and florida is doing incredibly well and we re catching the benefit of that charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer no question about it and when you look at for example unemployment rates in most of the markets we re in and some of them now they re below 3 just incredibly strong environment and consumers are employed and we re just seeing really positive things here very competitive certainly in florida but i think we offer a really unique value proposition with the level of service that we deliver and the like in those markets we re also as you well know very focused on continuing to grow and support our production folks in the field and we have a lot of tools that we use to help them do that and we re expanding that group every month as we continue to grow out into the franchise if you look ahead at our market share in a lot of these markets there s nothing but upside for us as we continue to grow the franchise so very very excited about the next few years and what that will bring in terms of growth jeff cantwell guggenheim securities llc thanks very much and my second question is related to that i was curious if you could talk a little bit about what you re seeing with your existing customer base in terms of cross sell and we saw your data analytics and things of that nature and obviously you guys have put a lot of work into making sure that you re staying on top of the trends with your customer base so i guess my question is which products are you seeing the most success with from a cross selling perspective right now and are there areas where you would expect to be doing more cross selling over the next call it 12 to 18 months jeffery lee executive vice president and chief digital officer hey jeff it s jeff lee i ll answer that question for you we to continue to see really good progress in the cross selling of deposit accounts loan accounts and also some of our fee areas as well i think wealth in particular has done a really good job of tapping into the cross sell opportunities a lot of that is banker driven where we re getting the referrals in i think when you look at the penetration of some of these products and services there s still a lot of room to grow and take advantage of what s still existing in the platform that we already have so there s still value to be created but we ve seen continued good momentum at the cross selling of deposit activity loan activity and the fee activity products as well jeff cantwell guggenheim securities llc great and then if i could just squeeze one last one and it s just related to your earlier some of the earlier questions that we heard about the loan growth guidance for this year and could you just help us out there a little bit maybe at a high level explain where you expect to see that growth to come from is there a geography in particular it looks very strong for example can you just maybe just give us a little bit color there charles m shaffer chief operating officer and chief financial officer yes no problem the bulk of the growth comes out of the commercial banking franchise and it s primarily coming out of broward county palm beach county somewhat in our legacy market or the treasure coast but also orlando and tampa and in particular around the more metropolitan markets is where we see the bulk of the growth dennis s hudson iii chairman and chief executive officer yes and i would just reiterate that the focus when you look at where our investments are in terms of handling that growth they re clearly in the metro areas that s where we see the deep markets and the incredible growth happening in those markets but i would also say that it s pretty evenly distributed across the entire franchise we have had been working very hard to make investments in across the franchise but particularly in markets where we have more upside in terms of market size and tampa being one of those and so we ve seen pipelines grow generally across the board but they ve become far more even i would say over the last year and due to a lot of hard work by

kelsey president and chief executive officer thank you heather and good morning everyone please begin with our fiscal first quarter results on slide 3 after the close of the market yesterday evening we reported results for our fiscal first quarter of 2020 we achieved record quarterly revenue of 852 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of 780 million to 820 million this revenue represents 11 growth over the comparable period in fiscal 2019 and 5 growth sequentially our healthcare life sciences sector exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter as our team responded to increased demand from several customers in addition our industrial commercial sector produced exceptional results as we capitalized on further strengthening in the semiconductor capital equipment market and broad improvements in demand throughout the remainder of the sector we delivered gaap eps of 1 03 including 0 17 of stock based compensation expense and non gaap eps of 1 both exceeded our guidance range which was 0 87 to 0 97 the non gaap result excluded a net 0 03 benefit due to special tax items our global teams continue to prioritize operational excellence and through that focus delivered fiscal first quarter operating margin of 4 7 at the midpoint of our guidance range and within our target range of 4 7 to 5 please advance to slide 4 next i will discuss additional accomplishments within the fiscal first quarter of 2020 i will start with items associated with the balance sheet we continue to make progress on our working capital initiatives in the fiscal first quarter we ended the quarter at 87 days of inventory representing an 18 day improvement from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 our inventory performance coupled with improved receivables days and payables days led to a cash conversion cycle of 71 days our cash cycle is down 18 days over the past two quarters the end result was another exceptional quarter of free cash flow we delivered 61 million of free cash flow in the fiscal first quarter this follows a result of 92 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019 we created meaningful shareholder value and delivered return on invested capital of 14 7 this result represents an economic return of 590 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital of 8 8 and exceeds our target of 500 basis points next i will highlight accomplishments related to our revenue growth despite having been impacted by award timing around the holidays our teams delivered 167 million of manufacturing wins within the fiscal first quarter our healthcare life sciences team had another particularly strong quarter with 85 million in wins predominantly with existing customers due to our capabilities and proficiency at delivering exceptional quality products the continued strong wins performance positions our healthcare life sciences sector for an excellent fiscal 2021 our wins momentum which we define as trailing four quarter wins divided by trailing four quarter revenue remains above our target of 25 this level is sufficient to maintain solid growth within our differentiated markets in addition our teams reported a funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities of 2 5 billion which is a reflection of the diligence and strategic focus of ourglobal marketsector teams we expect to leverage this funnel to deliver a strong wins result in the fiscal second quarter our industrial commercial sector is exploiting portfolio diversification program ramps and strengthening within the semiconductor capital equipment space to drive outstanding growth our fiscal first quarter revenue was up 42 from the comparable period in fiscal 2019 our aerospace and defense sector continues to show signs of another exceptional growth year our fiscal first quarter results represented 41 year over year revenue growth our focus on 0 defects and perfect delivery resonates with customers in these highly complex markets please advance to slide 5 our portfolio continues to differentiate plexus from our peers as we strengthen our leadership in highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments within the fiscal first quarter 93 of our revenue was generated from the combined healthcare life sciences industrial commercial and aerospace and defense market sectors this position has increased from 79 just three years ago during a period of significant revenue growth our focus in these complex markets provides advantages in operational efficiency and results in more consistent reliable performance for our customers advancing to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2020 on slide 6 we expect revenue to moderate in the fiscal second quarter as we believe some of the fiscal first quarter strength is impacting current quarter demand particularly in our healthcare life sciences sector we expect continued strength in our industrial commercial and aerospace and defense business with revenue relatively flat within these sectors as compared to the strong results of the previous quarter as a result of these factors we are guiding revenue in the range of 790 million to 830 million our operating margin is being impacted by seasonal payroll costs which we estimate at about 50 basis points and the pause of two substantial programs in our engineering organization as such we are guiding operating margin in the range of 4 to 4 5 we anticipate revenue and operating margin at these levels will lead to gaap eps in the range of 0 80 to 0 90 including 0 21 of stock based compensation expense and excluding any nonrecurring charges we are proactively responding to the engineering program pauses by strategically repositioning our boulder design center to co locate with our existing manufacturing facility in boise idaho this opportunity will allow for the creation of an aerospace and defense center of excellence this combination of engineering and manufacturing services will provide the synergies and cost advantages of a campus environment while delivering a compelling service offering for our customers in the aerospace and defense sector our boise manufacturing facility is rapidly growing its aerospace and defense business and is also home to our microelectronics center of excellence please advance to slide 7 for a few thoughts regarding fiscal 2020 our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains generally unchanged from previous expectations we anticipate sequentially increasing revenue during the second half of the fiscal year as we benefit from our recent wins performance largely stable end markets and improving semiconductor capital equipment demand resulting in solid revenue growth for the fiscal year we are enthused with the outlook for our aerospace and defense and industrial commercial sectors where we expect robust growth in addition we anticipate fiscal 2020 revenue in the combined healthcare life sciences industrial commercial and aerospace and defense sectors to exceed 90 of our portfolio consistent with our fiscal first quarter results these sectors have programs with longer life cycles in many cases 10 years or more we have achieved compounded annual growth rates in the teens within these markets our goal is to maintain these growth rates as we move beyond fiscal 2020 coupling the anticipated fiscal 2020 growth with our comprehensive service offerings focus on operational excellence aligned cost structure and talented workforce committed to delighting our customers we expect solid operating performance with return to operating margins within our target range of 4 7 to 5 in the second half of the year this level of performance would enable robust eps expansion for the full fiscal year i will now turn the call over to steve for additional analysis of the performance of our market sectors and operations steve steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you todd good morning please advance to slide 8 for a review of our performance by market sector for the fiscal first quarter of 2020 as well as our expectations for the sectors for the second fiscal quarter of 2020 our healthcare life sciences revenue was flat in the fiscal first quarter the result easily surpassed our expectations of a mid single digit decline our customers forecast did not show a seasonal strength as we entered the quarter however 15 of our top 20 customers in the sector increased forecast within the quarter to meet robust calendar year end demand the strong calendar year end shipments is impacting our fiscal second quarter projections we expect approximately a 10 decline for our healthcare life sciences sector in the fiscal second quarter we believe this demand swing is a short term correction and the sector will rebound in the fiscal third quarter revenue in our industrial commercial sector increased 17 for the fiscal first quarter the result was significantly better than our expectations of a low single digit increase although the largest revenue increases were led by our semiconductor capital equipment customers greater demand from 11 of the top 12 customers in the remaining subsectors contributed to the strong growth as we look at the fiscal second quarter we expect that the semiconductor capital equipment subsector will maintain the increased level of demand however we see a modest pullback in some of the other subsectors the net result is that we are anticipating revenue to be flat for our industrial commercial sector in the fiscal second quarter we are in close communication with several of our semiconductor capital equipment customers as there are indications that we may see additional upside to our current forecast for calendar 2020 the obvious questions we re trying to answer is when and how much our aerospace and defense sector was down 1 in the fiscal first quarter the result was slightly lower than our expectations of a moderate increase slightly slower ramps on two programs were the main reason for the lower revenue looking at the fiscal second quarter we expect growth with new program ramps to be offset by modest softness with three aerospace customers as a result we are expecting flat revenue for our aerospace and defense sector in the fiscal second quarter we anticipate that the new program ramps will be largely complete within the quarter and that they will add provide meaningful growth for the sector in the fiscal third quarter our communications sector declined 5 in the fiscal first quarter a result that was below our expectations of flat revenue weaker demand from four of our top five customers was the cause for the decline as we look toward the fiscal second quarter we see continuing softness from customers in the sector as a result we are expecting a mid teens decline in our communications sector for the fiscal second quarter we expect to gain more visibility regarding the calendar 2020 outlook from our communications customers as we progress through this quarter please advance to slide 9 for an overview of the wins performance of the fiscal first quarter we won 30 new manufacturing programs that we expect to generate 167 million in annualized revenue when fully ramped into production we experienced slower than typical decision making during the holiday season which had a negative impact on the wins results in the fiscal first quarter as we look at the fiscal second quarter our wins performance has started very strong and we anticipate a solid result for this quarter our trailing four quarters of wins at almost 450 million yields a win momentum of 26 the result is above our goal and it continues to support our growth strategy please advance to slide 10 for further insight into the wins results by region the americas region had another strong quarter of wins at 89 million in the fiscal first quarter our focus on the design and manufacturing of highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments continues to fuel our growth the americas wins in the quarter included two large robotic assisted medical devices and winning these programs is a clear indication that that strategy is working the apac region wins of 64 million are the result of diverse capabilities the team has developed the wins vary from a small single use medical device that weighs a few ounces to a complex test system that weighs over several hundred pounds these wins illustrate the vast range of expertise plexus has developed for our customers in the differentiated markets we serve the emea region s wins of 14 million highlights the importance of our commitment to operational excellence in the region market share gains in a long term security customer as well as the addition of a new division from a transportation customer are indicators that the dividend from our great execution is growth with our customers please advance to slide 11 for further insight into the manufacturing wins performance by market sector our healthcare life science team had solid wins result of 85 million in the fiscal first quarter that will enable sustained growth for the sector the robotic assisted medical devices and the new single use device program that i highlighted are expected to start adding meaningful revenue in fiscal 2021 the industrial commercial sector produced 44 million of manufacturing wins in the fiscal first quarter the wins included the addition of a new customer who delivers factory automation solutions through the use of robotics and artificial intelligence plexus ability to demonstrate our expertise in the manufacturing of complex electromechanical assemblies was a key differentiator in securing this win the aerospace and defense sector generated 17 million of new wins in the fiscal first quarter just as important as the size of the wins is the duration of the programs one of the larger wins in the quarter includes a program for the c 130j airframe that we expect to build for at least the next 10 years a highlight in the quarter was a visit by two c 130j crews to our neenah manufacturing facility our teams had the opportunity to tour the planes and speak with the crews as you can imagine the crews appreciate our commitment to 0 defects finally our communications sector wins of 21 million included a new customer who provides products that support the infrastructure and wireless connectivity and high speed communications including 5g applications please advance to slide 12 we exited the fiscal first quarter with a robust funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities at 2 5 billion we have the pipeline of new opportunities required to support continued growth the healthcare life sciences funnel continues to be very healthy at 1 5 billion in addition to the size of the funnel the quality of the opportunities are strong we expect the funnel to support robust wins performance in the fiscal second quarter and beyond the industrial commercial sector increased their funnel to 404 million while generating solid wins within the fiscal first quarter the resource investments we made in fiscal 2019 are starting to have a positive effect on the funnel and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal 2020 the aerospace and defense sector grew its funnel by 9 in the fiscal first quarter and we see momentum in the sector continuing to build in addition to having increased opportunities to gain market share with our customers the pipeline of new activities that feeds the funnel is growing steadily a few final comments todd highlighted our decision to relocate our boulder design center to our manufacturing facility in boise idaho in one regard it was a challenging decision as i know some of the team will not be relocating for those colleagues i want to thank you for your dedication and service to plexus during your tenure for the colleagues who will be moving to boise the prospect of creating a full value stream service offering at this site especially for our aerospace and defense customers is exciting plexus has a strong track record of creating differentiated service offerings and i want to thank you for your willingness and commitment to support plexus in establishing this unique capability in boise i will now turn the call to pat for an in depth review of our financial performance pat pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you steve and good morning everyone our fiscal first quarter results are summarized on slide 13 revenue of 852 million was above the top end of our guidance while gross margin of 9 3 was at our midpoint selling and administrative expense of 39 3 million was above our guidance primarily due to higher variable incentive compensation expense as a percentage of revenue sg a was 4 6 sequentially improved by 20 basis points and consistent with our expectations operating margin of 4 7 was at the midpoint of our guidance and within our target operating margin range included in this quarter s operating margin was approximately 60 basis points of stock based compensation expense nonoperating expenses of 5 7 million were slightly above our guidance as a result of foreign exchange losses our gaap effective tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was 10 which included a net benefit of 800 000 related to special tax items recorded during the quarter excluding these items our non gaap effective tax rate was 12 slightly favorable to our guidance range of 13 to 15 gaap diluted eps of 1 03 included 0 03 per share related to the special tax items excluding these items non gaap diluted eps of 1 was above the top end of our guidance primarily due to the strong revenue results turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 14 during the quarter we purchased approximately 91 000 shares of our stock for 6 3 million at an average price of 69 82 per share at the end of the fiscal first quarter we had approximately 40 million remaining under the authorization for the fiscal first quarter we were pleased with our free cash flow results we generated 75 million in cash from operations and spent 14 million on capital expenditures resulting in free cash flow of 61 million we ended the quarter with the strong balance sheet cash of 255 million was sequentially higher by 29 million we also reduced debt under our revolving credit facility by 33 million both improvements were primarily driven by strong cash flow generation at the beginning of the quarter we adopted the new accounting standard for leases the balance sheet impact from adoption was a net addition of 46 million for leased assets and 47 million for leased liabilities in calculating our return on invested capital we are now including the lease liability within average invested capital the impact from this inclusion is a detriment to roic of approximately 35 basis points despite this detriment we were very pleased to deliver 160 basis point improvement to our return on invested capital this quarter compared to our results in fiscal 2019 cash cycle at the end of the first quarter was 71 days a nine day improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter over the past two quarters we have improved our cash cycle by 18 days please turn to slide 15 for details on our cash cycle the nine day sequential improvement was driven by a reduction to our receivable days and an increase to our payable days each improved by six days for receivable days we experienced a better balance of shipments throughout the quarter compared to last quarter where shipments were weighted more toward the third month also with the quarter ending january 4 we have the opportunity for additional collections from customers with a period close of december 31 for payable days we experienced a return to more normalized procurement activity prior to the fiscal first quarter we had a pullback in purchasing in order to improve our inventory management we have now worked through that impact as todd has already provided the revenue and eps guidance for the fiscal second quarter i ll review some additional details which are summarized on slide 16 fiscal second quarter gross margin is expected to be in the range of 8 8 to 9 2 at the midpoint of this guidance gross margin would be approximately 30 basis points lower than the fiscal first quarter todd mentioned the 50 basis point impact from seasonal compensation cost increases of this total 40 basis points will impact gross margin we also expect an impact on gross margin due to program pauses in engineering services a portion of these impacts is anticipated to be offset by lower healthcare costs in the second quarter compared to the fiscal first quarter for the fiscal second quarter we expect sg a expense in the range of 38 million to 39 million at the midpoint of our revenue guidance anticipated sg a would be 4 75 of revenue sequentially up 15 basis points primarily due to the seasonal compensation headwinds fiscal second quarter operating margin is expected to be in the range of 4 to 4 5 which includes 80 basis points of stock based compensation expense the operating margin guidance is exclusive of any restructuring charges related to the strategic reposition of our boulder design center at this point we are still formulating the details and overall charges associated with the plan a few other notes for the fiscal second quarter depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately 15 million slightly higher than the fiscal first quarter nonoperating expenses are expected to be in the range of 4 6 million to 5 million at the midpoint of this guidance these expenses would be sequentially lower by 900 000 primarily due to the absence of foreign exchange losses which were experienced during the fiscal first quarter for the fiscal second quarter we estimate an effective tax rate of 13 to 15 and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 30 million shares our expectation for the balance sheet is for working capital dollars to increase as we ramp new programs during the quarter and begin procuring inventory later this quarter for the anticipated sequential increase in fiscal third quarter revenue based on our revenue forecast we expect this level of working capital will result in cash cycle days of 75 to 79 days for the fiscal second quarter we expect free cash flow around breakeven as we ramp new programs and build inventory we remain focused on sustaining inventory improvements and anticipate generating free cash flow in subsequent quarters for the full year we continue to expect free cash flow in excess of 100 million finally our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 55 million to 70 million with that john let s now open the call for questions questions answers operator thank you and our first question is from shawn harrison from longbow research shawn harrison longbow research analyst good morning everybody just to say i know it s a small piece of the mix and so it s probably not the biggest focus but within the communications i think the old goal was to have that business flat potentially for the fiscal year and with the underperformance last quarter and the decline this quarter maybe if we could get into just what is the incremental weakness there i think the thinking was that it had bottomed out but it clearly hadn t and maybe what could the back half look like is there further deceleration in that business steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer this is steve i can i ll handle that one looking at this quarter i think as you probably know the msos are announcing their first quarter projections today and through the end of next week and i think we ll get a lot more visibility into what their spending is going to be so i think people are hesitant to really start building product in advance of those announcements and so from an architectural standpoint we do see distributed coming up a bit we see a little bit of upside in more of the centralized architecture and so i think people are really trying to figure out what is going to be the winner for the architecture as we go into fiscal 20 and i think that will dictate for us kind of what 20 looks like as i look toward the back half of the year we do see some strengthening and even in q3 the forecast now are basically holding with what we thought but again i think until we see what comes out from the msos and our spending patterns and our customers adjust their forecast where we truly understand what the back half of 20 looks like todd kelsey president and chief executive officer one of the things i d add shawn is that our expectations for the longer term had been for comps to stay flat i think for 20 we always expected it to be down because we face a really big headwind from some of the demand that s dropped from a significant customer within that space going into it as steve had mentioned we have a couple of program ramps that could turn the trajectory of the revenue in a different direction in the back half of the year but we d still expect it to be a single digit sector for us shawn harrison longbow research analyst ok and then as a follow up i mean defense aerospace grew 40 in the december quarter it looks like you have a really bullish outlook for 20 still are you seeing any impact from the production stoppage of the 737 max or is it just that you ve got so many diversified wins that that stoppage is not really impacting the business todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes i think it s the latter shawn i mean it s we have a very diversified portfolio within aerospace i mean the indications on our 737 max program is there s been no impact as of yet but even if there is it will be negligible to our aerospace and defense revenue you won t notice it shawn harrison longbow research analyst all right great congrats on the results todd kelsey president and chief executive officer thank you steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks operator our next question is from matt sheerin from stifel matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst yes thanks and good morning just a question regarding your operating margin guidance for the coming quarter and for the year you re still looking at 4 7 to 5 range for the second half but you did originally guide for the full year are you is that still something that you could achieve or is that at this point really dependent on how the year shapes out todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes i would say it s a bit dependent right now i mean we see the back half of the year as being 4 7 to 5 with a pretty strong likelihood but for the full year i think it remains a little bit as to how we come through this quarter because this quarter is a bit more challenged than we had anticipated but we should be right in that area for the full fiscal year matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst and you re looking for pretty significant growth based on your wins in the second half wins from some of these sectors and i know in the past with some of these programs there s cost related to that which is always a little bit of a squeeze on margins is that factored into your guidance in terms of expectations because you have visibility on those ramps so you can manage those better todd kelsey president and chief executive officer it is yes it is matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst ok and then on the inventory side pretty strong reduction it sounds like you re going to start to build some inventory back up are you seeing any signs of component constraints like you have in previous quarters or are you able to run relatively lean here steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer yes matt this is steve we re not seeing the component constraints we saw in the past i mean there s always an issue here and there that we ll continue to chase but nothing compared to what it was in previous quarters matt sheerin stifel financial corp analyst ok thank you very much operator our next question is from jim ricchiuti from needham company jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst good morning just a question on some of the strength you re seeing in the semi cap part of the industrial business you seem to be suggesting that there may be some upside in that area of the business looking out over the balance of the year is that coming from multiple customers and i assume that that s better margin business is that correct steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer so to answer the first part of your question this is steve yes we see a potential for upside in the coming quarters the question is and it s kind of how i stated it is how much and when i think generally speaking across all of the customers they do expect to see upside in the coming quarters it s really been hard to predict when that s going to hit so obviously this quarter was strong that strength is continuing into this quarter but will we see more in the back half of the year is what we re working through so we re working very closely with customers to make sure that from a capacity standpoint and an inventory standpoint we have the right things in place and then in terms of margin profile it varies by customer and by program i mean it s in line with where plexus expectations are so we ll pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jim this is pat i think when we see increased volumes from customers we can gain some fixed cost leverage but to steve s point it doesn t necessarily mean the margins are stronger by customer jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it and just looking at the what you saw in the healthcare life science vertical i m just trying to understand were there some was there some potential unexpected pull ins of business that you might have been anticipating in the fiscal second quarter that benefited you in q1 todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes we did see some pull in that appears to be q1 demand or first calendar quarter demand shifting into the fourth calendar quarter so our q2 shifting into q1 we hadn t seen that as we entered the quarter it didn t appear that our customers were going to show any end of calendar year strength but that changed over the course of the quarter and we do expect it to have an impact on our current quarter jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst and todd that was from multiple customers todd kelsey president and chief executive officer multiple customers yes steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer 15 of the top 20 had upside in the quarter jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst ok got it and just i know you re not giving guidance specific guidance looking out to the fiscal second half but it seems like the there s the potential that your sg a expense going forward is going to be at a slightly higher level is that also partly due to some of the mix changes you re seeing in the business pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer not necessarily jim i think we can hold our sg a to the levels they re at this past quarter was higher because of higher incentive compensation and that was a combination of the strong revenue and the return on invested capital that s what was driving that higher we do have the merit increases this quarter but we typically work through those through productivity improvements so i wouldn t expect it to be any higher than what we re looking at in q2 jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst ok and then you alluded to some pause in the engineering program so i wonder if you could just give a provide a little bit more color on that todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes well we saw a couple of significant programs that paused and i would call them for different reasons and i wouldn t call them indications of any market softening they re pausing because of issues around the customers and one was with a more significant healthcare oem and they re basically taking a closer look at their business case balancing features versus development effort within that program so that s caused them to step back for a bit and others with a more early stage customer that s really looking at their overall business model so we think that there s a reasonable likelihood that both will go forward at some point but right now it s having a near term impact for us jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it and that early stage customers is that also healthcare or is that in your one of your other sectors todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes it is healthcare it is healthcare jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst thank you operator our next question is from paul coster from jp morgan paul coster j p morgan analyst yes thanks for taking the question the manufacturing wins trend has been sort of slightly down over the course of the last few quarters you sound confident that it s going to rebound pretty quickly and i m just wondering what you think the underlying cause might be is it the trade uncertainty and disruptions to supply chains or is there some other reason for this recent trend and its pending reversal steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer yes this is steve i ll handle that one and actually i think i misspoke in the beginning i think i said our trailing four quarters were 450 million it s actually 850 million and so a quick correction on that one but from a trend standpoint i think one of the things that we re analyzing and looking at as we look at the trailing four quarters the healthcare life sciences and aerospace and defense sectors those trailing four quarters the revenue levels for those quarters have been the highest they ve been in the last couple of years and so those programs are a bit smaller but as we re trying to talk about here is the duration of the things that are significantly longer and as we ve basically deemphasized and we see the communications numbers coming down those are historically higher numbers but the program durations were much smaller and so as we look forward we re confident as we re growing in these diversified sectors and todd talked about that over 90 of our revenue is going to be in these diversified sectors that we re generating the wins that we needed to continue to grow and so i think one of the things we need to do is take a look at the metrics that we re using and make sure that now that we have this different portfolio the size of the wins that we need we believe are supporting the business and we ll have to make sure that our metrics are measuring the right thing paul coster j p morgan analyst makes sense you said 15 of the 20 healthcare life sciences customers pulled forward is there an underlying trend to explain that steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer from my perspective if you looked at the beginning of the quarter we actually talked about the fact that we had historically in the past seen some seasonal upside in our fiscal q1 related with the year end demand our customers have not forecasted that as significant as they had in the past and so we didn t know quite frankly if there was going to be softer demand in the q1 in our q1 but as we came through the quarter we realized that that demand was really there and customers needed to pull it in and so we did that for them so i don t know there s much more we can read into it i think the demand was strong at the year end our customers didn t anticipate it we reacted to it and again i think as we look at the forecast going into q3 we think it s going to rebound back to a normal level so we do see it as just a one or two quarter kind of fluctuation paul coster j p morgan analyst last question is so we re seeing a number of companies in this space following your script a bit which is to deemphasize the short product cycle business the volatile business and focus on these long product cycle verticals and also we re seeing some pricing discipline do you concur that there is sort of rational pricing happening in your industry at the moment and how does that play out over the course of time todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes it from our perspective there is rational pricing in the industry right now from a competitive standpoint though we don t see things as being significantly different i mean it s always been competitive in our spaces we ve always kind of competed with the same people that looks rather similar but the pricing situation is i would call it decent right now so that s certainly a positive for all of us i think if we have good pricing discipline and drive to get value out of the services that we re providing pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and paul in some of these complex sectors that we operate within there is higher working capital requirements and so we ve got to make sure the margins support that higher working capital and i think our competitors are thinking the same and focusing on the return on invested capital side and ensuring those margins are high enough paul coster j p morgan analyst thank you operator our next question is from anja soderstrom from sidoti anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst hi everyone congratulations on the great quarter and a lot of good questions asked already i just wanted to follow up on sort of the contract wins how can you bucket that from how much you are winning from existing customers versus winning transferring customers from in house production and maybe also how you are comparing to peers steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer so if i understood your question correctly as we look at our wins in our funnel we traditionally fall from a 60 70 customer to a 30 40 target split both in wins as well as the funnel and our focus varies by sector for example in our healthcare life sciences sector we believe the number of logos and the customers that we have there s a lot of opportunity to continue to harvest from them and support the growth that we need again we re always looking at adding new customers but again they believe they have a strong customer base as we looked at industrial commercial through fiscal 2019 one of the things we recognize is that we needed to add new customers to the portfolio and so they focused that sector focused heavily on doing that and made great progress doing it and so we do look at it by sector but we think that roughly 70 30 60 40 split from customers to targets is a very healthy path forward with us obviously growing with customers is much easier they ramp quicker than it does with targets so we like that mix anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst ok thank you and also you mentioned that you re moving the shifting into the 90 over 90 of your revenue in the healthcare life sciences and aerospace and defense and industrial and commercial so and their life cycles there are much longer can you just remind us how those compare to the communications and how much short are the communications todd kelsey president and chief executive officer yes sure we tend to think of the communications as being about a three to five year life cycle on programs and whereas we look at aerospace and defense being in the mid to mid teens to even 20 year life cycle and healthcare and industrial tending to be closer to a 10 year life cycle so it s quite a difference in when you re providing solid execution maintaining the business and the amount of churn that s in the portfolio and the amount of business that you need to win anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst ok that was helpful and also lastly what are you going to do with all the cash pat jermain executive vice president and chief financial officer good question so we ll continue to buyback we expect to execute that remaining portion of the buyback this year and we are paying down some of our debt and we ll continue to do those two things and then reevaluate we continue to see this level of free cash flow moving forward we ll look at our alternatives around a future buyback or consider the merits of a dividend too anja soderstrom sidoti and company analyst ok thank you that s all for me operator and we have a follow up question from jim ricchiuti from needham company jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst the repositioning of the boulder design center at boise i assume that is that something that has been under consideration and in the works for a bit todd kelsey president and chief executive officer it s been under consideration for a bit because we saw the advantages strategically of having an aerospace and defense center of excellence as we see aerospace and defense as a great growth opportunity for our engineering solutions organization and co locating those two facilities made a lot of sense strategically but really the pauses in the engineering programs i guess were the impetus to be able to move forward with it so what we had considered it it s a bit i d call it it s taking or looking at the situation that we have in front of us and addressing it steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer we have started our boulder design center before our boise operations and if you had done it reverse you do exactly what we re doing now which having that center of excellence with the co location and the full value stream is a significantly bigger value add for our customers and so as todd said taking advantage of the situation and making a better long term strategic alignment is the right way to go for us jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it and maybe you guys if you could maybe just remind us as you think about some of your other verticals and to what extent are have you adopted this kind of a strategy in some of the other verticals with these centers of excellence todd kelsey president and chief executive officer well it hasn t necessarily been pegged as centers of excellence but there s a great deal of co location between our engineering facilities and our manufacturing facilities and we found that to be very effective jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it that s it for me thanks a lot operator and we have no further questions at this time i ll now turn it back over to ceo todd kelsey for closing remarks todd kelsey president and chief executive officer all right thank you john and i just wanted to close briefly by thanking everyone who joined our call today we appreciate your support we appreciate your interest in plexus operator duration 49 minutes call participants heather beresford senior director of communications and investor relations todd kelsey president and chief executive officer steve frisch executive vice president and chief operating officer pat jermain executive vice president and

new york at the annual meeting of the american economic association aea in early january former us federal reserve chair janet yellen former european central bank president mario draghi and eminent economists warned that western economies risked japanification a future of sluggish growth low inflation and perpetually low interest rates yet surprising as it may seem this malaise also threatens east asia hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan once called the asian tigers now face slow growth and disinflationary pressures last year hong kong s economy contracted by 1 2 per cent while the other three grew only modestly singapore by 0 6 per cent and south korea and taiwan by about 2 per cent each inflation in each of these three countries was about 0 6 per cent east asia s economies suffered from weaker external demand a result of slow growth in major industrialised countries and china as well as domestic structural and supply factors moreover their growth potential is trending downward economically and demographically these east asian countries seem to be tracking japan for starters japan is the world s most rapidly aging society with 28 per cent of its population aged 65 and above up from 14 per cent in 1994 this age cohort s share of the population in hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan now averages about 14 per cent and is forecast to increase rapidly in the coming decades a shrinking workforce will in turn reverse the demographic dividends that previously supported strong regional growth in south korea for example average annual gdp growth between 2020 and 2040 is forecast to be about one percentage point lower than now moreover like japan in recent decades the four east asian economies are experiencing slowing productivity growth their export industries have encountered fierce competition from low cost chinese firms while low service sector productivity hampers overall productivity improvements and because these countries are already at the high tech frontier they may find it harder to develop new technologies in the future how east asia s policymakers respond to these challenges will be crucial many economists believe that the bank of japan s timid response to the collapse of the country s real estate bubble 30 years ago aggravated the economy s woes leading to the lost decades that followed mindful of this precedent the fed and the ecb have aggressively cut interest rates and injected large amounts of liquidity since the 2008 financial crisis as has the boj under prime minister shinzo abe s administration speaking at the aea meeting former fed chair ben bernanke expressed confidence in central banks ability to provide further economic stimulus using new policy tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance but many economists are sceptical as former us secretary of the treasury lawrence summers has noted leading central banks have failed to meet their inflation targets despite massive monetary expansion and with interest rates already at record lows it will be difficult to resolve the next crisis with further aggressive rate cuts furthermore monetary easing alone cannot tackle major structural economic weaknesses summers for example argues that excessive saving and low investment in industrialized economies could result in secular stagnation mohamed el erian emphasises structural disinflationary forces such as aging rising inequality and a loss of trust in institutions while economists including robert j gordon highlight slower productivity growth given their significant structural problems therefore east asia s economies cannot avoid the japanification solely by loosening monetary policy in fact such measures might even do more harm than good over time although these economies have not experienced an asset bubble collapse like japan continued monetary easing could pose such a risk over the last year the hong kong monetary authority and the bank of korea have cut their policy rates several times to 2 per cent and 1 25 per cent respectively benchmark interest rates in singapore and taiwan also remain low at 1 64 per cent and 1 375 per cent respectively as the experience of japan has shown expansionary monetary policy can keep the economy afloat but with asset price bubbles and many zombie like firms to stave off japanification the four east asian economies should adopt a comprehensive set of policies to overcome their structural weaknesses first governments should spend more on productivity enhancing infrastructure technologies and education in order to boost potential growth such public investment in productive sectors could complement weak private demand and expand supply capacity governments could finance this increased spending by issuing low interest rate bonds but they must avoid an excessive build up of public debt especially the share owed to foreign investors without an international reserve currency too much debt could trigger a default and foreign exchange crisis second east asian governments must address the issues of population aging and a shrinking workforce they need to encourage higher labor force participation among women and seniors boost worker productivity through lifelong education and skills training and allow active migrant inflows expanding access to childcare and providing flexible working arrangements would help to raise fertility rates and governments must tackle inefficiencies in both the financial sector and regulatory policies in order to improve productivity growth finally east asia s governments must focus on increasing economic and social equality and bolstering public trust in institutions despite japan s prolonged economic stagnation its society has remained harmonious and stable providing a solid foundation for managing stable growth in east asia however rising economic inequality amid weak growth is eroding public confidence in political institutions the civil disturbances that have rocked hong kong and south korea over the last year are evidence of this without strong public trust and confidence the next economic calamity whether a japan style slowdown or another financial crisis could prove difficult to overcome the risk of japanification is clear and not only in western europe faced with this threat east asia s aging tigers must take urgent steps to regain their vitality lee jong wha professor of economics and director of the asiatic research institute at korea university was a senior adviser for international economic affairs to former president lee myung

no one ever makes a billion dollars you take a billion dollars chided u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y earlier this week you didn t make those widgets she added you sat on a couch while thousands of people were paid modern day slave wages are literally dying because they can t afford to live this latest rant continued her war on the entrepreneurs and the capitalist system responsible for creating the most widespread economic abundance and highest quality of life in the history of mankind in the united states real income over the past 40 years has risen for all income levels to the point where a middle class income in 1980 could qualify as lower middle today and an upper middle class income in 1980 would qualify as middle class today life expectancy has increased nearly eight years since 1970 ocasio cortez refuses to acknowledge that in a free society individuals become wealthy by meeting customer needs wealth and economic output expands or shrinks based on a combination of human ingenuity labor natural resources and capital investment few wealthy people get that way from plundering others they create wealth by bringing to market products that benefit others consider an apple orchard apple trees are the capital asset apples the product forcing an orchard owner to convert some of the trees to firewood would deplete the supply of capital apple trees and diminish future economic output apples confiscating the net income of the orchard owner would leave less capital to expand for the owner and less growth for the economy income taxes or the wealth taxes proposed by ocasio cortez and other progressives yield the same results across an entire economy less economic output and lower future growth jeff bezos the world s wealthiest man at 131 billion transformed commerce through amazon steve jobs bill gates michael dell and larry page revolutionized information technology the walton family re engineered retail through walmart expanding consumer choice driving down costs and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in prior generations businesspeople and inventors such as henry ford and thomas edison earned fortunes by improving the lives of others but those fortunes reflect only a small fraction of the value added to society by their innovation to punish such success is to incentivize consuming wealth rather than investing and growing and to deter other entrepreneurs from even trying to start businesses capital represents far more than cash locked away in a scrooge mcduck vault instead capital means factories manufacturing equipment and intellectual property yielding output and creating wealth capital confiscated through taxation means less capital to replace obsolete or deteriorated equipment fewer resources for research and development and diminished funds for business expansion this is akin to dismantling productive machinery and redistributing the pieces as scrap metal although the wealthy are immediately affected this confiscation reduces the quality of life for all income levels over the longer term plundering the wealthy harms all of us furthermore tax hikes on the wealthy alone or even on the upper middle class simply cannot adequately fund the massive government spending programs ranging from 48 trillion to 92 trillion over 10 years promoted by the left recently the government could confiscate every dollar earned starting with dollar no 1 by those with incomes of 200 000 or above and every penny of corporate profits and still raise only 32 trillion and that presumes people and corporations would continue normal operations despite all their income being taxed away a european style cradle to grave welfare state requires european levels of taxation and the sluggish economic growth that accompanies it what does this look like payroll taxes in parts of europe exceed 50 a value added tax of more than 20 hurts consumers rich and poor a middle class worker earning 40 000 a year in europe pays 6 000 more in taxes than the typical u s worker those earning 100 000 pay 16 000 more in taxes annually it s no surprise that the average family disposable income in germany is 11 000 less than in the united states in reality the desire for power rather than economic betterment fuels the war on wealth just as ocasio cortez s former chief of staff admitted the green new deal is about transforming america rather than resolving a climate crisis so the war on billionaires is a grab for economic control in the words of ocasio cortez herself to be ethical if you re a billionaire today the thing that you need to do is give up control and power so i don t want your money as much as we want your power central planning elites thrive on directing society and controlling economic development as they deem fit dismantling our free market capitalist system erases opportunities for ordinary citizens and levels the wealthy communist revolutions of the past 150 years in russia china eastern europe cambodia and cuba bear witness to the brutal impact of the most extreme agendas the lackluster economies and high taxes across spain france greece and italy warn of the milder misery resulting from the softer tyranny of socialism we must reject both the war on wealth is a war on us all
it s a lot more possible to amass 100 000 than you might think and you might even become a millionaire too here s how there s a good chance that the thought of having a 100 000 portfolio or a bigger one will make you laugh sorrowfully after all nearly half of americans have saved precisely nothing for retirement according to a 2019 report by the u s government accountability office based on 2016 data it s very likely much easier than you think to amass a sizable retirement war chest unless you re just few years from retiring even then though there are some productive moves you could make here s a look at how you might move beyond a money market or savings account with low interest rates and get invested in stocks which tend to offer higher returns even if you ve already saved a lot you can probably increase your wealth further perhaps even becoming a millionaire here s a guide to vastly improving your future financial security your soon to be 100 000 portfolio will likely consist of some or all of these investments index funds managed mutual funds individual stocks dividend paying stocks you can do it let s start with a pep talk because you might be assuming that attaining a 100 000 or larger portfolio is simply out of reach for you as long as you have some time though it is attainable the table below shows how annual investments of only 1 000 can get you there and how investments of more annually will get you there faster growing at 8 for 1 000 invested annually 3 000 invested annually 5 000 invested annually 5 years 6 336 19 008 31 680 10 years 15 645 46 936 78

the stock market s long term annual growth rate over many decade has been close to 10 still the average growth rate over your investment period could be greater or lower than 8 proof that it can be done in case you re doubting that ordinary people can amass millions here are some of many examples out there eva gordon she never went to college and worked as a legal secretary and trading assistant

investor in blue chip stocks for decades he never earned more than 47 000 but was worth several million dollars at his death some of things that many of these folks had in common were living relatively frugally investing in stocks over decades and being patient you might not have 67 years in which to invest but you may still amass millions if you can sock away some meaningful sums over lots of years the table below offers a little inspiration growing at 8 for 10 000 invested annually 15 000 invested annually 20 000 invested annually 5 years 63 359 95 039 126 718 10 years 156 455 234

million dollar portfolio don t dismiss the big numbers in the table above most likely some are better goals for you than a mere 100 000 because you ll probably need more than that to generate enough retirement income for a comfortable future applying the flawed but still helpful 4 rule offers a rough idea of how much retirement income a 100 000 portfolio will generate the rule suggests you withdraw 4 of your nest egg in your first year of retirement and then adjust future years withdrawals for inflation so 4 of 100 000 is 4 000 that s just 333 per month when it comes to how big a nest egg you ll need for retirement there s no one size fits all amount many people suggest 1 million which will generate 40 000 in your first year of retirement with the 4 rule or 3 333 per month but that might be too much or too little for you how much do you need for retirement to determine how much money you need for retirement spend a little time estimating what income you ll need in your golden years if you look up what experts suggest you ll see numbers ranging from 40 to 80 or more of your pre retirement income that s a big and mostly unhelpful range so take some paper and a pencil and start estimating what your expenses are likely to be in retirement be as comprehensive as possible including housing taxes insurance food clothing transportation entertainment utilities gifts travel hobbies and so on don t forget healthcare expenses either as they re likely to be substantial eventually you ll arrive at your desired total annual retirement income now consider your expected income sources social security is likely to be one for example the average monthly social security retirement benefit was 1 478 or about 17 700 annually those who earned more than average in their working lives will collect more than that but the maximum for someone retiring at their full retirement age in 2019 was 2 861 per month or 34 332 per year will you be receiving any pension or annuity income factor that in too let s say that you determine you ll need 60 000 in annual income upon retirement and that you re expecting 30 000 from social security and you have no other income other than what you can get from your retirement investment accounts you re looking at a shortfall of 30 000 take that 4 rule or whatever percentage you plan to withdraw from your nest egg and invert it by dividing 100 by it dividing 100 by 4 gives you 25 so multiply the 30 000 shortfall by 25 and you ll get 750 000 that s the size of the nest egg you ll need in order to withdraw 4 and get 30 000 are you ready to build your 100 000 or bigger portfolio before you jump into building your big portfolio through investments take a moment to make sure you re really ready to invest for starters are you carrying any high interest rate debt such as from credit cards if so you need to pay that off first fortunately it s possible to get out of debt from even huge burdens next do you have an emergency fund stocked with around six to nine months worth of living expenses be sure you do or be sure to know how you ll manage if you re suddenly out of work for some months or face a major expense such as a new transmission for your car or costly surgery for yourself for long term wealth building look to the stock market once you re ready to start building wealth the stock market is where your money is likely to grow the most briskly as stocks tend to outperform alternatives over long periods indeed stocks outperformed bonds in 96 of all 20 year holding periods between 1871 and 2012 and in 99 of all 30 year holding periods according to wharton business school professor jeremy siegel siegel calculated the average returns for stocks bonds bills gold and the dollar from 1802 to 2012 asset class annualized nominal return stocks 8 1 bonds 5 1 bills 4 2 gold 2 1 u s dollar 1 4 the following table takes those annualized returns from the table above and looks at how an annual investment of 10 000 would grow at those rates over time 10 000 invested annually 10 years 20 years 30 years in stocks at 8 1 157 345 500 201 1 2 million in bonds at 5 1 132 812 351 219 710 383 in bills at 4 2 126 270 316 806 604 318 in gold at 2 1 112 309 250 561 420 750 in the u s dollar at 1 4 108 033 232 179 374 843 by the way over a shorter period from 1926 to 2012 siegel found that stocks grew at an average annual rate of 9 6 vs 5 7 for long term government bonds make the most of retirement accounts as you save and invest consider doing so using tax advantaged retirement accounts such as iras and 401 k s at least to some degree here are key things to know both iras and 401 k s come in traditional and roth varieties with traditional accounts you contribute money on a pre tax basis shrinking your taxable income by the amount of your contribution and thereby shrinking your tax bill with roth accounts you contribute post tax dollars and receive no upfront tax break but if you follow the rules you can eventually withdraw money from the accounts tax free which can be a big deal if the account has grown large iras offer the widest range of possible investments if you open an ira with a good brokerage you can invest that money in just about any stock and gobs of mutual funds meanwhile 401 k s typically offer a limited range of funds in which you can park your dollars for 2020 you can contribute up to 6 000 total to one or more iras plus an additional 1 000 if you re 50 or older the contribution limits for 401 k s are far more generous for 2020 you can sock away up to 19 500 plus an additional 6 500 for those 50 and older totaling 26 000 open a brokerage account if you don t have a brokerage account in which to be buying and selling stocks you ll need to open one read up on the best brokerages and how to open a brokerage account before rushing into brokerage you see advertised in a nutshell you can open an account online or by visiting a brick and mortar brokerage office you ll need to fill out a little paperwork and deposit some money to start investing with some brokerages have minimum initial investment amounts and others don t whereas each buy or sell order you place used to cost up to 100 or more just for the transaction those commission fees have fallen over several decades now and many brokerages are currently offering free trading these investments will help you build a 100 000 or greater portfolio so now that you re ready to start building wealth or to build it with more determination perhaps aiming for faster growth it s time to review the kinds of investments you should consider at a minimum steer clear of the ways to lose money in the stock market such as through penny stocks investing on margin and trying to time the market but better than that keep learning about smart investing approaches and about the best investors such as warren buffett too four great kinds of investments to learn about and consider are index funds managed mutual funds individual stocks and dividend paying stocks here s a deeper dive into each no 1 index funds it s hard to go wrong with low fee index funds that track a broad stock market index as they ll deliver returns very close to the performance of the overall stock market even warren buffett has recommended them suggesting investors consistently buy an s p 500 low cost index fund i think it s the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time don t think that you ll be dooming yourself to sub par growth with index funds either by definition you ll be earning par returns index funds have actually outperformed their more actively managed counterparts over long periods indeed as of the middle of 2019 over the past 15 years fully 90 of large cap stock funds underperformed the s p 500 so consider favoring low fee broad market index funds such as ones that track the s p 500 below are a few good index funds to consider including one that tracks the bond market these are technically exchange traded funds etfs too which mean they re mutual fund like creatures that trade like stocks letting you buy as little as a single share at a time the spdr s p 500 etf spy this fund tracks the s p 500 index of 500 of america s biggest companies it s often used as a proxy for the overall u s market which isn t a stretch as its holdings make up about 80 of the total value of the u s stock market spy this fund tracks the s p 500 index of 500 of america s biggest companies it s often used as a proxy for the overall u s market which isn t a stretch as its holdings make up about 80 of the total value of the u s stock market the vanguard total stock market etf vti this fund encompasses all of the u s stock market including the many smaller companies not in the s p 500 vti this

the u s market vt this fund tracks the whole world s stock markets including the u s market the vanguard total bond market etf bnd this fund tracks the overall bond market holding mostly medium term bonds and ones backed by the u s government but also including corporate and other bonds while many actively managed mutual funds charge annual fees expense ratios of 1 or 1 5 or more it s easy to find index funds charging 0 25 or 0 10 or less that kind of difference can save you a lot of money if you simply and regularly plunk your money into low fee broad market index funds and do so for many years if not decades you re likely to see your money grow at a good rate with extremely little effort on your part no 2 managed mutual funds while index funds are considered passively managed because their managers don t have to analyze stocks and decide what to buy actively managed mutual funds feature just that professional money managers who continually scour the markets for promising investments and who decide what to invest in and when and also when to sell various holdings for all this work they charge annual fees remember that the vast majority of managed funds underperform simple index funds so it really does make plenty of sense to just stick with index funds but if you want to try to find and invest in the best mutual funds ones that may serve you better than index funds give it a try if you fail over a few years you can move your money into index funds you ll need to research many funds look for low fees no sales load managers who have been with the fund for a while and who have good track records and philosophies you agree with understand that mutual funds often have a focus some are trying to achieve the best growth growth funds others are seeking income from dividends and interest income funds and some feature both stocks and bonds balanced funds the words fixed income typically refer to bonds while equity refers to stocks large cap mid cap and small cap funds will respectively focus on companies with large medium and small market capitalizations or market values some funds will focus on a geographical region such as europe asia or emerging markets while others will focus on certain industries software financial companies healthcare etc remember that broad market indexes can include most industries company sizes and even geographic regions no 3 individual stocks investing in individual stocks gives you a chance at really great returns but it can be much riskier too you can reduce your risk somewhat by spreading your money across 10 to 20 or so stocks and you can combine investments in individual stocks with ones in index funds too you ll want to learn a lot about investing and to keep learning as well as you ll come to appreciate you shouldn t invest in any company until you understand how it makes its money in detail that s its business model and it can range from making and selling things in its stores to processing payments online via technology to licensing its name for others to use you know its business well all the products and services it offers and those of its competitors you understand its competitive advantages such as scale or a strong brand or a network that rivals would have trouble duplicating you ve read lots of articles and opinions about it not just from those who admire it you ve read its financial statements and have a grasp of its financial health its debt levels it cash levels its growth rates profit margins and so on you know why you re buying it and when you d sell it you plan to keep up with its progress by following it in the news and reading its quarterly and annual reports to get an idea of how some familiar names have performed over time check out the table below which also shows how the s p 500 performed over the same period company 20 year average annual growth rate 1 000 would become unitedhealth group 21 1 46 013 sherwin williams 20 5 41 662

include dividend paying stocks why well because they offer you not only the prospect of their share price increasing over time but they ll also pay you cash regularly as long as they remain healthy better still even the best companies go through slumps on occasion and see their shares sag but they will usually still keep paying out those dividends even increasing their payouts over the years imagine for example one day having a 400 000 portfolio of dividend payers with an average dividend yield of 3 a company s dividend yield is the amount of its total annual dividends divided by its current stock price that will kick out 12 000 per year to about 1 000 per month if you re in retirement and need income it s income that doesn t shrink your portfolio via the sale of any stocks if you don t need income for a while you can invest that money in more shares of stock the table below offers an idea of the kinds of dividend yields you can find from familiar names of course they will rise

only one you might invest in a mix of index funds managed mutual funds dividend paying stocks and non dividend paying stocks armed with the information and guidance above you can now take steps toward building a portfolio of 100 000 or more perhaps by first paying off your high interest rate debt or by opening a brokerage account to establish an ira for best results keep reading and learning fool

while trump cuts food stamps usaid bankrolls venezuela regime change with half a billion in tax dollars the trump administration has spent 654 million in aid to try to overthrow venezuela s government including 435 million through usaid and 128 million directly to juan guaidó and his corrupt coup gang all while imposing crippling austerity at home by ben norton january 24 2020 information clearing house under president donald trump the united states has dumped over half a billion dollars into regime change related aid efforts targeting venezuela s elected un recognized government from 2017 to december 2019 the trump administration spent at least 654 million on venezuela related aid schemes while washington claims this spending assisted humanitarian efforts much of the us taxpayers money financed efforts to destabilize and ultimately overthrow the government of president nicolás maduro the us agency for international development usaid is a central arm of washington s hybrid war on socialist and independent states around the world it has a long and sordid history of funding civil society groups and political opposition parties to topple the governments of designated enemies usaid has provided 435 million of this 654 million bankrolling venezuela s right wing us controlled opposition at least 128 million of this usaid money went directly into the pockets of the coup leaders that the trump administration attempted to install as the rulers of the country in 2019 usaid recently divulged this shocking level of support acknowledging that it is going to fund venezuelan anti government activists ngos and opposition media outlets along with the supposed interim government led by us appointed coup leader juan guaidó as well as venezuela s national assembly which until january was led by guaidó and controlled by the right wing opposition while the united states is spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to overthrow venezuela s leftist government the trump administration is aggressively cutting social programs at home to slash 4 2 billion in public expenditures over five years trump gutted food stamps that fed 700 000 poor americans most of whom are children funding this crucial program would cost just around 840 million per year close to the amount trump has poured into us regime change efforts in venezuela the trump administration has also drastically cut taxes for the rich and large corporations thanks to these cuts the richest 400 billionaires in the us now pay a lower tax rate than the poorest americans as working class americans increasingly bear the burden of this taxation their tax dollars are being spent on destroying socialist governments in the global south usaid s role in us coup attempt against venezuela usaid has long acted as a front for the cia and other government agencies disguising regime change activities as supposed humanitarian work under the administration of donald trump the organization s role as an arm of us hybrid warfare has become more aggressive than ever are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter in february 2019 a usaid plan was revealed to train aid workers as special operations forces who serve in teams with military and intelligence operatives to advance us national security interests that same month the ostensible humanitarian agency was activated as the lead element in a plot to overthrow venezuela s elected government usaid collaborated with the defense department and state department in a scheme in cucuta colombia on venezuela s border usaid worked hand in glove with venezuelan coup leaders many of whom disguised themselves as so called aid workers on february 23 they tried to ram a us aid convoy across the venezuelan border the putsch attempt was ultimately unsuccessful so as a last resort violent right wing coup mongers set the aid on fire and washington and the international media immediately blamed the maduro government in a scheme first exposed by the grayzone s max blumenthal and finally acknowledged weeks later by the new york times actual aid organizations publicly condemned usaid s involvement in the violent coup attempt the international red cross said the stunt is for us not humanitarian aid and the united nations slammed the politicized nature of usaid s activities usaid funding of juan guaidó s corrupt coup cabal in its december statement usaid claimed no funds are provided directly to elected national assembly members high level officials of the guaidó administration ambassadors or the interim president himself but in the same breath just one sentence prior the agency acknowledged usaid is providing compensation travel costs and other expenses for some technical advisors to the national assembly and the interim guaidó administration through assistance funds usaid s denial of direct funding appears to be bald faced lies in october the grayzone reported that through usaid us taxpayers are paying the salaries and expenses of venezuelan opposition leaders from guaidó s shadow regime the grayzone contributor leonardo flores noted that usaid signed an october 8 agreement with guaidó s ersatz administration that included 98 million in assistance allotted for venezuela the los angeles times obtained an internal government memo which showed that approximately 42 million of

venezuelan soldiers to defect over to the colombian side and launch an armed uprising against maduro in reality senior members of guaidó s us backed party voluntad popular instead used the money to live it up in colombia in just a few weeks the venezuelan coup mongers flushed well over 125 000 down the drain spending wildly on swanky hotels expensive dinners nightclubs and designer clothes in

are greatly exaggerated but that millions of venezuelans have been displaced because of the conflict likely somewhere around 3 million the crisis has been undoubtedly fueled by washington s blockade of the venezuelan economy and relentless attempts to overthrow its government however the largest external displacement in the modern history of the western hemisphere has taken place not in venezuela but rather in its neighbor colombia where a brutally repressive right wing government backed to the hilt by washington has waged a decades long internal war against leftist insurgent groups millions of colombians have been displaced because of this us backed war which is still ongoing colombia s war was aggravated and prolonged by the us government s notorious plan colombia which scholar greg grandin has blamed for catastrophic violence on the country resulting in a mountain of corpses and millions of displaced civilians 7 7 million internally people were displaced in colombia in 2017

due to the magnitude of corruption plaguing the zimbabwe national road administration zinara many reckoned that rehabilitating the parastatal would necessarily involve a root and branch approach and the board led by engineer michael madanha mm which was appointed in january 2019 was tasked to do exactly that our online editor garikai mazara gm sat down with the board chairperson mm and asked him about the direction zinara is taking as well as what the future holds gm you have maintained since your appointment that zinara should stick to its core mandate that of funding road projects do you have road projects that you think are a priority this financial year mm true zinara now only sticks to its core mandate which is to fix collect and disburse levies to the four road authorities in the country specifically for roadworks but let me give you the background of how zinara was operating previously because of a plethora of challenges in local authorities from lack of capital skills to equipment zinara had taken over the implementation of road projects which was not within its mandate zinara had all those from skilled personnel the financial muscle and the equipment but it was not its mandate to construct and rehabilitate roads it was within this matrix that a lot of underhand dealings took place you will find that from the grant thornton audit report of which us 71 million was reported to have been siphoned from zinara there are four classes of financial outlay that we have since categorised the first one was when quality roads were completely funded and done of which the tendering process was done by zinara which was wrong second quality roads which were completely funded but not finished for instance out of 10km paid for you will probably find eight kilometres done to standard the third class involves roads that were completely paid for but were poor quality roads probably because of leakages either within zinara or the contractor the last class of roads were paid for but nothing was even done we have such roads in chegutu for instance so when we were appointed as a board we resolved that we stick to our mandate as defined in the road act to fix levies collect the same and disburse to the four road authorities which are rural district councils urban councils the district development fund and the department of roads gm do you have road projects that you think are a priority this financial year if you have which roads are these and why are they top priority mm our major priority is to ensure that the harare beitbridge road is well funded for completion by 2023 right now there are five contractors on the ground each doing 20km which means we have covered 100km of the almost 600km stretch to speed up the process we intend to engage more contractors so that by 2023 we have finished the road the harare beitbridge highway is of prime importance to us because it is the major artery of the country and the sooner it is completed the easier it is to do business for the country and the region besides all provinces will also get funding according to their priority lists our intention is to fund at least 20km per year per province of which each province decides which road s get priority i must hasten to add that road funding is not the sole prerogative of zinara treasury also has a role to play in road construction as well as donors you must be aware of the makuti kariba 6km stretch which is being funded by jaica japan international cooperation agency so in some instances there can be multilateral funding gm how does zinara hope to tackle inflation first in terms of revenue as collections might not match the rate of inflation on the other hand what a contractor proposes or submits in a budget today might not be the same value at the time of implementation how do you hedge against such eventualities mm cognisant of the day to day challenges that face the ordinary citizen in general and the motorist in particular we will review tolling fees on a bi annual basis but other levies like fuel levy or motor licences would be reviewed on a regular basis similarly when prices increase we review unit prices so that contractors are able to complete their contracts we do contract variations gm the arrangement between zinara the development bank of south africa dbsa and group five has dominated public interest for some time with suggestions that zinara is struggling to meet its obligations what is the position now and has zinara s financial position improved enough to be able to meet these obligations mm we pay dbsa in foreign currency and converting rtgs dollars to usd united states dollars is a challenge due to inflation we have ring fenced the transit fee levies collected in usd to service the dbsa debt and also we engaged a transactional advisor to negotiate the extension of the repayment period gm engaging a transactional advisor is it not one of the vices that the previous administration was guilty of of engaging third parties mm the previous executive without any technical know how and back up went to negotiate with dbsa for that loan which in itself was a misnomer you cannot have managers most of them without intimate financial knowledge negotiating with finance people people whose life depend on negotiating so the result was that zinara was left with contracts and not just the dbsa loan which were skewed against the road authority the intertoll agreement for example is drawing much more than zinara is realising we have a situation where contractors are reviewing their stake and takings yet zinara is not reviewing its position yet these agreements have provisions for reviews by either party by the way such contracts are supposed to be a win win scenario so what we are looking at is deal restructuring not deal reversal mapping the way forward and these are negotiations which we cannot handle ourselves deals that need financially minded people to handle gm on improving revenue collection it is a matter of public record that your board has tightened most screws on the leakages that plagued the authority probably the public might be interested to know how widespread these leakages were and what you have done to plug these leakages mm leakages were rampant but of most concern to us was changing the organisational culture that was obtaining at zinara house where backbiting personal wars fighting for positions was the order of the day under the ceo we had three directors technical human resources and finance and each director controlled revenue streams aligned to his portfolio for instance the finance director controlled tolling fuel levy abnormal and overloads as well as some commissions so he would control from the recruitment down to the collection collation and auditing of these levies similarly the hr director would control licencing which is about 50 percent of zinara revenue whilst the technical director would oversee all tenders and contracts so there was a deficiency of corporate culture with each director being a demi god there were fiefdoms in the organisation when we got in as a board the authority had gone for six months without a board and almost a year without a substantive chief executive so the fights for power control and the purse had reached intolerable levels so you find the leakages that were happening within zinara were more of organised crime with the floor persons possibly paying illegal remittances to their bosses those who were found to have crossed the line were not punished but merely transferred from one station to the other but when we came on board we sought to rectify these anomalies and so far we have not renewed contracts that had lived their full term some have voluntarily resigned when all is said and done we want to reduce our staff complement from around 650 to around 450 so the cleaning exercise is still going on and we will not be deterred by those planting false stories about either myself or my board in the media we have an obligation to clean up zinara and we are doing exactly that and it was just more than changing the toxic culture we have also improved our systems to curb leakages and actually our revenues have significantly increased anyone who will be caught on the wrong side will be fired in accordance with labour laws we are re training our staff and restructuring and streamlining our activities we are also reviewing our working conditions to meet workers expectations to tie in with the expectancy theory you cannot expect someone who handles your cash on a daily basis to be underpaid so we are looking at constantly improving our staff welfare gm it is also on public record that local authorities are not happy with disbursements from zinara what could be done to improve this relationship mm road authorities need to think outside the box and look for other sources of funding through ppps private public partnerships and bots build operate transfer funds from zinara will never be sufficient to fund the more than 98 000km of roads in the country we will continue to increase funding to local authorities but these funds will never satisfy all their needs we all need to be innovative zinara got into a relationship with group five to fund the plumtree mutare highway and local authorities can copy the same example and engage in a public private partnership gm could there be any new tollgates to be introduced on the country s road network this year or maybe in the foreseeable future mm as i mentioned earlier our core mandate is revenue collection we do not construct tollgates that is the mandate of our parent ministry ministry of transport and infrastructural development they are the one who decide on new tollgates at most we just play an advisory role
abstract the investment of multinational enterprises mnes in host countries is considered as a channel of technology transfer which is expected to improve the productivity of invested countries firms the spillover effect of foreign investment can occur through four channels namely imitation skills acquisition competition and exports empirical studies however present ambiguous evidence regarding to the impact of mnes technology transfer on the productivity of domestic firms in which the positive spillover effect seems to only happen in developed countries but the effect is also quite weak in other words the spillover effect does not automatically appear at all domestic firms it requires host countries and domestic firms have sufficient conditions to absorb well benefits from mnes these conditions may include absorptive capacity geographical proximity labor mobility and mnes voluntariness local suppliers with low technology gap close distance to mnes and high quality workforce are more likely to gain benefits from mnes technology transfer to help domestic firms get benefits from mnes investment the local government should have policies to improve national and industrial absorptive capacity develop special economic zones to enhance connections between domestic firms and mnes and develop domestic supporting industries to encourage mnes willingness to share their technology and experiences keywords multinational enterprise mnes technology transfer spillover effects 1 introduction mnes and associated foreign direct investment fdi have rapidly grown for the recent decades as they are considered to play an important role in the development of the host countries one frequently referred effect of mnes is technology transfer which is expected to lead to productivity spillover to indigenous firms and then enable them to produce more efficiently many empirical studies on technology spillovers from mnes to domestic firms however have given mixed results evidence from developed countries shows relatively weak positive productivity spillovers xu 2000 while foreign presence has negative effects or no relationship with productivity of domestic firms in developing and transition countries ahmed 2012 konings 2001 there are a number of explanations for the ambiguous effects it would seem that spillovers may simply be unimportant in reality or they are the result of failure in developing the statistical methods and or the lack of datasets negative effects are likely due to competition effects under which multinationals with lower marginal costs attract demand away from domestic firms or they can be explained by the lags of domestic firms learning from mnes görg and greenaway 2004 positive effects can result from the tendency for multinationals to invest in already highly productive sectors and plants aitken and harrison 1999 while the mixed effects show that productivity spillovers are not automatically converted from mnes to all domestic firms it remains full expectation of positive spillovers for firms which have the sufficient conditions to absorb well the benefits from fdi this study uses the meta analysis to find out the conditions for domestic firms to have positive spillover effects from the mnes the results are expected to have great contributions to the efficiency of the fdi into the host countries as a result promote the fdi attracting policies in these countries the remaining of the article is divided into three more sections the section 2 reviews the literature the sections 3 discusses the conditions for positive spillover effects the section 4 concludes and discusses policy implications 2 literature review there are many explanations for a firm s decision to engage in foreign direct investment fdi as a multinational enterprises mnes according to dunning 1977 it involves three interrelated aspects ownership of an asset location to produce and internalization whether to keep the asset internal to the firm which comprise the so called oli framework of multinational activity but this theory concentrates on the greenfield mode of fdi where the parent firm builds a new production facility in the host country and explains little about the cross border mergers and acquisitions m as known as brownfield fdi in which the parent firm has control over an existing indigenous firm gưrg h and greenaway d 2004 state the general reason why an mne sets up overseas is to protect its proprietary knowledge of some form when multinationals invest in host countries with their intangible assets it is expected that foreign ownership will increase firms productivity and domestically owned firms will benefit from the presence of foreign firms aitken and harrison 1999 in this concern mnes are considered to be channels of technology transfer which is the process of transferring skills knowledge technologies methods and samples of manufacturing and other facilities productivity spillovers can be implemented in many different ways gưrg h and greenaway d 2004 present four channels through which spillovers can occur so that the domestic firms might boost their productivity first is imitation it is the classic transmission mechanism which may apply to both product process and managerial organizational innovations its scope depends on the complexity of the origins the simpler the origins the easier to imitate second is acquisition of human capital after employing relatively skilled labor in the host country the mne will generally invest in training to make them meet the production requirements besides some specific knowledge of the mnes may spill over to domestic firms employees when they are exposed to new production techniques when the experienced workers move from mnes to domestically owned firms or leave to start their own businesses this valuable human capital may help raise the productivity through two mechanisms first a direct spillover occurs when complementary staffs improve the firms productivity second knowledge of new technology or management techniques which the employees take with them can be usefully applied in the firms competition also plays an important role in adoption of new technology according to the research results of wang and blomstrưm 1992 glass and saggi 2002 incoming mnes make competition become intensive for indigenous firms and lead to a reduction in inefficiency fierce competition forces firms to become more productive by using existing technology more efficiently updating production techniques or imitating the mne s production processes in addition competition may increase the speed of adoption of new technology as well as the speed of imitation export spillovers are another source of productivity through collaboration or imitation domestic firms can learn to export from multinationals such as establishing distribution networks creating transport infrastructure learning about consumers tastes and regulatory arrangements in overseas markets barrios gưrg and strobl 2003 greenaway sousa and wakelin 2004 the linkage between exporting and productivity can be explained by the firms self selection into exporting clerides lach and tybout 1998 bernard and jensen 1999 or by the increase in their productivity after entering into export markets delgado fariđas and ruano 2002 girma greenaway and kneller 2004 despite theoretically positive channels of generating technology transfer to domestic firms evidence from empirical studies is mixed according to gưrg and greenaway 2004 19 out of 40 studies in developing developed and transition economies report statistically significant and positive spillover effects xu 2000 shows that positive effects of the u s mnes technology transfer to local firms occur in developed countries but not in developing countries the papers using data of developing transition and emerging countries even find some evidence of negative spillovers in the aggregate ahmed 2012 konings 2001 in conclusion spillover effects from mnes investment into domestic economies are complicated depending on the characteristics of the industries and economies that receive the fdi inflows as well as the foreign investors buckley et al 2010 iršvá and havránek 2013 the failure to find an unambiguous result in econometric work can be explained in a number of different ways followings are some of the most plausible explanations one possibility is that spillovers are simply insignificant in reality because mnes may somehow prevent firm specific assets and advantages from being spilt over in case spillovers exist mixed effects can still be the result of the failure in developing the statistical methods and or the lack of datasets for example productivity spillovers do not occur under horizontal technology transfer but through vertical relationships which are difficult to separate them out in the estimating regression furthermore heterogeneity in spillovers and aggregate studies are also a serious impediment according to gưrg and greenaway 2004 negative spillovers may be due to competition effects with some firm specific advantages mnes are able to cut the costs to have lower marginal costs which allow them to attract demand away from domestic firms as a result domestic firms are forced to reduce production and then loose market shares in this case fierce competition not only brings no help for local firms to generate new technology from mnes but reduces their productivity and draws them out of the market as well besides the domestic firm s lags to learn from multinationals can be a possible reason for negative spillover obtained by short run analyses aitken and harrison 1999 explain the positive results by the tendency for multinationals to invest in already highly productive industries and plants it means that firms with low initial productivity have little chances to benefit from mnes technology transfer 3 conditions for positive spillover effects empirical research has shown that foreign equity participation may be positively correlated with plan productivity but technology spillovers are not automatically converted to all firms it requires the host countries as well as the domestic firms have the sufficient conditions to absorb well the benefits from mnes following are some conditions for domestic firms to have positive spillover effects from mnes 3 1 absorptive capacity absorptive capacity of a host economy denotes the maximum amount of benefits that can be assimilated or integrated into the economy in a meaningful manner kalotay 2000 although there is not yet a standard theory on absorptive capacity and its determinants absorptive capacity can be described at two levels 1 the domestic firms level including the technological intensity and qualifications of labor 2 the national level involving the technology gap human capital resource physical infrastructure investment policy administrative framework financial and institutional development etc at the first level domestic firms absorptive capacity has a close relationship to their initial total factor productivity clearly absorptive capacity is directly related to the potential gains from spillovers zang et al 2010 damijan et al 2013 have shown that firms with high absorptive capacity are able to access the benefits from technology transfer specifically domestic firms with small initial productivity gap are more likely to gain positive spillovers from mnes than those with low initial productivity likewise the smaller the technological gap between the domestic firms and mnes the higher the quality of technology transferred and the higher the potential for spillovers 3 2 geographical proximity two important channels for technology transfer are acquisition of human capital and imitation through which indigenous labor can improve their knowledge of new technology or new management by training and learning by doing to apply in domestic firms in this case geographical proximity is an important factor to facilitate knowledge spillovers as knowledge is vague difficult to codify and often only serendipitously recognized audretsch 1998 therefore firms located near multinationals are more likely to benefit than other firms 3 3 labor mobility labor mobility can be one mechanism through which mnes transfer positive spillovers on domestic firms balsvik 2011 it is evident that domestic firms which are able to hire employees especially managers and engineers from the foreign firms have higher productivity in addition firms with younger and more skilled labor force can also increase their stock of human capital through interaction with employees from mnes over long periods of time it will become the productive advantage of domestic firms 3 4 mnes voluntariness the degree of spillover benefits depends on the voluntariness to transfer of mnes the more voluntary the mnes the more productive the domestic suppliers however mnes voluntariness may be very different between the vertical and horizontal technology transfer havranek and irsova 2011 when firms are the mnes local suppliers mnes with voluntary help to increase domestic firms efficiency can benefit from high quality of the products supplied by these firms in other words vertical technology transfer may bring benefits to both of the givers and the recipients in this case the stronger the spillovers among local suppliers the more benefits the mnes get and the more voluntarily the mnes transfer technology to domestic suppliers in contrast under horizontal technology transfer competition with the local firms in the same industry undermines the mnes incentives for technology transfer multinationals may preserve their specific knowledge and advantages not to leak to domestic competitors in this case there is no chance for spillovers in conclusion technology transfer from mnes may not have positive productivity spillover effects on all domestic firms it is clear that firms which have high absorptive capacity are located close to multinationals are able to hire employees from mnes and receive voluntary help from mnes have higher potential to benefit from technology transfer and have higher productivity 4 conclusions and policy implications this study aims to answer the question of conditions for domestic firms to benefit from the presence of foreign firms it is difficult to have one correct answer because of the changing macro and micro factors but those conditions may include absorptive capacity geographical proximity labor mobility and mnes voluntariness domestic firms which have high absorptive capacity are located close to multinationals are able to hire employees from mnes and receive voluntary help from mnes have higher potential to benefit from technology transfer and have higher productivity the findings contribute the practical framework for the empirical research in the future recently most econometric analyses end up using the total factor productivity tfp to find the evidence of spillovers from mnes to domestic firms with this study it is possible to go further to compare and point out how the different conditions of the firms industries and the countries that receive fdi of mnes relate with the productivity spillovers if any in particular considering two firms with similar weighted average of inputs mainly labor and capital and similar growth in inputs but different growth in real output they definitely have different tfp to find out the reasons the following model can be applied δtfp β0 β1δact β2δgpt β3δlmt β4δvolt εt in which δtfp is the difference of total factor productivity between two firms δac is the difference of technology gaps a proxy of absorptive capacity between two firms δgp is the difference of the geographical distance from the two firms to the mnes δlm is the difference of the number of foreign staff a proxy of labor mobility working in two firms δvol is the difference of the number of local suppliers a proxy of mnes voluntariness between two firms ε is the error term t denotes the time period this model can also be applied at the industry or country level if any estimated values of βi are statistically significant it is the evidence that those factors affect the process of productivity spillovers from the mnes to the firms the one with more favorable conditions are expected to benefit more from the mnes investment the limitation of this study is the shortage of empirical data to test the model in reality the reason is the difficulty in finding the two firms with exactly similar weighted average of inputs mainly labor and capital and similar growth in inputs to compare their tfps for the future study researchers might start with finding such firms and then apply this model using the time series data of those two firms to figure out if the estimated βi are statistically significant for the time being in order to help domestic firms to benefit more from mnes investment the government should facilitate with appropriate policies first to improve national and industrial absorptive capacity the government might invest more in technology and education to have highly educated and skilled human resources upgrade physical infrastructure reform the administrative mechanism and develop the financial and institutional systems second to take advantages of the effects of geographical proximity the government might continue to build up special economic areas like industrial

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

washington ap abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt advertising ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday advertising the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 advertising ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network advertising trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman advertising trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released advertising mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans advertising the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks advertising the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this

foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the

countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures

water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___

in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based

household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high

the global economy has been losing momentum since 2018 due to the trade frictions between the us and china and the uncertainties with brexit metal companies which largely depend on the global economic activity have been the worst hit the stock price of hindalco a manufacturer of aluminium and copper has fallen more than 25 per cent from the beginning of 2018 the recent signing of the phase 1 trade deal between the us and china has failed to address most of the key issues and retained the bulk of the tariffs imposed earlier but it has eased up tensions a bit and with fewer uncertainties around the brexit deal sentiments could improve for global trade and investment over the next one to two years while near term volatility may persist for commodity stocks such as hindalco the sharp fall over the past two years provides good opportunity to bet on the stock for the long term hindalco has a diversified presence across geographies and is well placed to benefit from a global recovery when it happens the centre s push for infrastructure spending will also help improve domestic metal demand the improving operational performance of novelis the us based downstream arm of hindalco is also a big positive for the company novelis acquisition of aleris one of the largest manufacturers of aluminium products in the us will also help growth at a current market price of 205 the stock is attractively valued at about 5 8 times its trailing 12 month earnings enterprise value earnings which is lower than the average of 6 06 times that it traded at over the past three years long term investors with a high appetite for risk can consider buying the stock outlook could improve hindalco derives its revenue from its domestic businesses of aluminium and copper and and its aluminium recycling facility in the us novelis in fy19 while sales of aluminium and copper from the domestic business constituted about 35 per cent of total sales of the company sales from novelis accounted for 65 per cent the international monetary fund imf projects higher growth in 2020 and 2021 for geographies such as europe germany south america and emerging markets hindalco has a presence in most of these locations lower growth projections for the us and china in 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019 is a concern though the imf has also predicted that the prices of non fuel commodities including base metals could increase by 1 7 per cent y o y and 0 6 per cent in 2020 and 2021 respectively on the domestic front while the imf s projections on india s economic growth are lacklustre at 5 8 per cent and 6 5 per cent respectively for 2020 and 2021 they are still better than 2019 s growth estimate of 4 8 per cent also the indian government s initiatives to improve investment in the infrastructure and housing segments coupled with low interest rates may support demand for metals going forward novelis the bright spot novelis a 100 per cent us subsidiary of hindalco sold 3 3 million tonnes of output in fy19 and contributed nearly 65 per cent and 55 per cent to the consolidated revenue and operating profits respectively of the hindalco group the subsidiary has been posting record operating profits year on year despite falling lme london metal exchange prices in the past two years on the back of favourable market conditions and strong demand the company derives its revenue from aluminium flat rolled products beverage cans 63 per cent of sales automotive sheets 20 per cent and speciality products 17 per cent novelis is also geographically well diversified in terms of its revenue mix north america 35 per cent europe 27 per cent asia 22 per cent and south america 16 per cent in fy19 the prospects for novelis appear bright especially for the beverage can market where consumer demand for sustainable packaging options a shift from packaging materials such as glass steel and pet continue to grow while there continue to be some pockets of softness for automotive aluminium sheets in non us auto markets the overall demand for aluminium sheets remains quite healthy also the availability and demand for scrap in the us is expected to get better the company s investment of 36 million to expand and upgrade its current recycling capacity in north america will augur well for growth the investment is strategically made as more auto makers turn to light weight aluminium vehicles but for now all eyes are on novelis 2 58 billion cash acquisition of aleris an aluminium manufacturer with a global footprint in europe the us and china which the management expects to contribute about 360 million about 2 500 crore to the firm s annual operating profit about 15 per cent of the group s operating profit in fy19 after the deal closure like novelis aleris too is primarily in the

blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

then look forward to answering your questions so my first stop was in sri lanka i was joined by lisa curtis the deputy assistant to the president from the nsc and as you know sri lanka occupies some very important real estate in the indo pacific region and itâ s a country of increasing strategic importance in the indian ocean region and we had productive meetings with president gotabaya rajapaksa who was elected last november and his brother prime minister mahinda rajapaksa as well as the foreign minister representatives of the opposition as well as leaders of the tamil national alliance and civil society and i would say the election itself was noteworthy sri lanka is asiaâ s oldest democracy the election was contested it was fair and it delivered a clear mandate to president rajapaksa

path of reform and reconciliation and we really welcomed the presidentâ s statement that he wants to be president for all sri lankans advertisement we have compelling shared interests that include

of our partnership will reflect our success in strengthening shared values including on the critical issue of healing the wounds of sri lankaâ s civil war advertisement from sri lanka we went to new delhi for the raisina dialogue the success of this annual conference reflects indiaâ s prominent role on the worldâ s stage and at the heart of the indo pacific region in addition to joining deputy national security advisor matt pottingerâ s meetings with the indian national security advisor and foreign minister we met broadly with the ministry of external affairs the prime ministerâ s office and the nsc as well as engaged opposition in civil society advertisement i think itâ s clear that indiaâ s broadening strategic horizons over the past two decades have resulted in a shift away from a passive foreign policy into one that more vigorously advances indian interests nowhere is that more true than in the indo pacific region whether itâ s in our growing maritime and naval cooperation the quad indiaâ s act east policy thereâ s virtually no daylight in our approaches to the indo pacific deputy national security advisor pottingerâ s remarks at raisina endorsing an indo pacific region stretching from california to kilimanjaro only further reinforced the strategic convergence advertisement my official meetings also focused on how to build on the diplomatic and defense gains achieved during the 2 2 ministerial dialogue last december with continued progress on defense cooperation peacekeeping operations space counterterrorism trade people to people initiatives and more i would highlight that the quality and frequency of our naval cooperation especially information sharing has reached unprecedented levels we also remain focused on achieving a trade deal that promotes fair and reciprocal trade and my colleagues from ustr are in delhi now to continue this progress advertisement the visit also offered an opportunity to hear more regarding developments with indiaâ s citizenship amendment act which is undergoing i would say a vigorous democratic scrutiny whether itâ s in the streets by the political opposition media and the courts we continue to underscore the importance of the principle of equal protection under the law advertisement on jammu and kashmir i was pleased to see some incremental steps including the partial return of internet service in kashmir and the visit by our ambassador and other foreign diplomats to jammu and kashmir is something that i know was extensively covered in the press we see this as a useful step we also continue to urge the government to permit regular access by our diplomats and to move swiftly to release those political leaders detained without charge from new delhi i traveled to islamabad where i held meetings with government military civil society and business leaders at the top of the agenda was understanding how we can grow our bilateral relationship commensurate with the cooperation that we are achieving in promoting peace in afghanistan and regional stability we appreciate the steps pakistan has taken to advance the afghan peace process and pakistan has important leverage to promote lasting security and stability in afghanistan i welcomed efforts by pakistan to meet its counterterrorism financing obligations under fatf the financial action task force we strongly encourage pakistan to work with fatf and the international community to fully satisfy its action plan commitments completion of the fatf action plan is critical to pakistanâ s economic reform efforts including its imf program as well as for demonstrating sustained and irreversible action against all militant groups based in pakistan without distinction weâ ve seen obvious progress in our relations with pakistan from the high level engagement such as the presidentâ s warm and constructive meeting with prime minister khan at davos to the restoration of the international military education and training programs i had extensive conversations on how we can bolster our economic partnership where the u s is pakistanâ s largest export market largest trade partner and historically one of its most significant investors there are obvious synergies in energy and agriculture and opening pakistanâ s markets to american investments creates jobs and wealth without sacrificing standards or fueling corruption weâ re looking forward to welcoming 10 pakistani buyer delegations to the u s and five regional trade shows in 2020 which will build deeper relationships between u s and pakistani firms prime minister khanâ s economic reform efforts contributed to the world bank identifying it as one of the top 10 reformers globally in 2019 one last item of note is what was announced earlier today that secretary pompeo will travel to kazakhstan and uzbekistan february 1 3 following his stops in europe the secretary looks forward to traveling to central asia to discuss important economic security and religious freedom issues heâ ll also reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of the countries of central asia so let me stop here and take your questions ms ortagus go ahead matt question can i â thanks i know this isnâ t your portfolio necessarily â iâ m going to ask about north korea no laughter iâ m kidding ms ortagus you didnâ t have a â question but can you if at all possible let us â tell us what your understanding of where current things are with the afghanistan peace deal ambassador wells i mean the only thing i can note is that ambassador khalilzad and his team are in doha they are encouraging the taliban to make a commitment to a reduction in force 1 that would allow afghans to sit at a negotiating table and so that process continues ms ortagus okay question may i ask a quick follow up ms ortagus yeah go ahead question sorry do you give any credence to the reports of more taliban violence coming out of afghanistan there have been some reports even just overnight that the taliban militants are killing civilians and other members of the ansf have you seen those reports do you â can you confirm â ambassador wells i have and the violence continues it obviously underscores why there needs to be a peace process and why the afghan people seek peace it also underscores the violence and the talibanâ s lack of inhibition in attacking civilians question the reason i ask if because of course as we know president trump said he would not allow some of the negotiations to go forward if the violence continued and that sort of spelled doom for the prospect of a peace process ambassador wells and thatâ s why there has to be the focus on the reduction in violence that the afghan people can see and feel and appreciate ms ortagus go ahead question pakistan and china is certainly upset with your comments on cpec and pakistan anything you want to say after the whole chaos over there ambassador wells well as youâ ve heard secretary pompeo addressed more broadly we have concerns over one belt one road and the fact that projects under one belt one road often donâ t adhere to international standards â sustainability labor environment and the argument that i was making in pakistan is that there are opportunities and should be opportunities for american investment american energy firms and manufacturers are interested in the pakistani market you have exxon mobil excelerate cargill honeywell all pursuing major new investments you have uber creating 80 000 jobs for pakistani youth and so as we do globally we argue in pakistan that â that there â you should adhere to the â buyer beware â that pakistan is a buyer these are not â this is not grant assistance from china itâ s loans often not with concessional financing and pakistan should beware of the terms to make sure that theyâ re getting the most for their money that brings the greatest economic prosperity question so you are not negating what exactly theyâ re saying they are actually agitating on that ambassador wells what â question they are kind of agitating on it â like foreign officers saying they are â itâ s meddling in their local affairs or the country affairs ms ortagus youâ re saying the chinese are saying that question theyâ re endorsing it ms ortagus i donâ t think â whatâ s the â so whatâ s the question question would it be meddling in local affairs the government affairs or pakistanâ s affairs ambassador wells oh of course not this is pakistanâ s sovereign right to decide what investment it seeks and on what terms and a friend of pakistan we certainly urge that they take on investment projects that create wealth generate employment and are sustainable and think we have great options for the pakistani market question thank you ambassador ms ortagus go ahead question do you think the imfâ s funding could get affected if pakistan does not meet the fatf regulations or the rules ambassador wells i mean obviously if pakistan were not to meet fatf obligations or were to fail and be blacklisted that would be devastating for pakistanâ s economic reform program and for its ability to attract investors weâ ve been pleased to see progress by pakistan towards fulfilling fatf obligations there is a meeting underway currently in beijing where pakistan is presenting its actions to the task force and so i defer to that task force to make its evaluation but the more evidence of pakistanâ s seriousness in both documenting its economy and in shrinking the space for militants to be able to take advantage of pakistanâ s either banking system or territory the more confidence that the international community and business community will have in working with pakistan question because pakistanâ s foreign minister was in town last week and he urged that now united states should step up to help pakistan get it out of the gray list ambassador wells well fatf is a technical process there has been an action plan that was presented to pakistan itâ s a question of fulfilling the requirements that have been spelled out and that are asked of all countries in the international system so itâ s not a political process but we certainly support and stand ready to assist pakistan as it implements these obligations ms ortagus okay conor question ambassador wells back here two questions if i could the first one has there been any progress since the decision to withhold certain economic assistance to afghanistan have you seen constructive steps from the ghani administration are you considering other funds be withheld to send a message if not and then secondly itâ s been i guess nearly four months now since the national elections are you concerned that thereâ s not been a clear outcome and at what point would you call for maybe a recount or a new election ambassador wells corruption is â fighting corruption is a key element of all of our programs in afghanistan we try to ensure that u s taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately and with the desired effect we are constantly looking for ways to enhance the effectiveness of donor dollars and so when secretary pompeo outlined areas of shortcoming it reflected our concern about what continues to be endemic corruption in afghanistan i am pleased that in one area that the secretary underscored we did see progress by the government of afghanistan and 60 million in assistance was able to move forward 2 and we certainly again encourage that the government as well as other implementers or recipients of assistance do everything possible to ensure that what are declining levels of economic assistance be put to maximum effect of the â afghanistan has to transition to become self reliant and to develop a private sector with regard to elections i think itâ s very important that the contestants in the election are adhering to the process the independent election commission and the electoral complaints commission are working according to the electoral law theyâ re processing the electoral complaints the electoral complaint commission has identified voting centers where they want to recount the ballots that process is proceeding and so our message is that itâ s better to get it right than better to finish â than to finish it quickly and so we are supporting the electoral institutions of afghanistan ms ortagus anybody else question what was the one area that you said you saw some progress and it freed up 60 million ambassador wells yeah we will get you the specific i donâ t recall the program offhand but staff can provide that to you question is there anything big or some â or that you would like to â anything you would like to highlight about the trip upcoming in either kazakhstan or other than what you just said there is there â in kazakhstan and uzbekistan is there any kind of deliverable that we should be expecting or looking for ambassador wells i think the secretaryâ s visit is important because it comes in the context of the administrationâ s central asia strategy which will shortly be rolled out which has important support again for the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of the central asian states heâ ll be hosting a meeting of the c5 so all of the foreign ministers of central asia which will be the second time heâ s done so in the year underscoring the importance we attach to also developing a regional identity among the central asian states at a time when weâ re working very closely with them to enhance regional connectivity and to help stitch afghanistan back into the region and so thereâ s been important progress in enhancing trade and investment and support for afghanistan at the same time that thereâ s been important developments in the modernization of the region thanks to the opening of uzbekistan with the passing of president karimov and president mirziyoyevâ s different stance towards regional integration question but my understanding has been in the past that the c5 when it gets together are generally talking about intra c5 opening up of trade and security counterterrorism that kind of thing is there also going to be â ambassador wells and also â question well right but also with afghanistan but is there anything u s â thatâ s less intra c5 and afghanistan and more c5 u s ambassador wells well i think counterterrorism cooperation weâ ve seen central asia become the leading â theyâ re the leading countries in reintegrating foreign terrorist fighters kazakhstan brought back 600 fighters and family members uzbekistan over a hundred tajikistan also close to a hundred and itâ s these countries that are actually going to be teaching us lessons from that reintegration process so ct will be an important part regional economic connectivity will be another and then economic modernization including a new project to enhance â to create a regional electricity market question are you going on the trip ambassador wells i am question who came up with california to kilimanjaro ambassador wells i think itâ s witty ms ortagus i like the line ambassador wells it used to be bollywood to hollywood and now â laughter no but what it â ms ortagus i want to claim credit for it ambassador wells but what it does signify â but thank you for noticing it because what it does â laughter because what it does signify â question except you have to spell california with a k laughter ambassador wells no but it signifies a definitional change because originally when we spoke about the indo pacific we did do hollywood to bollywood and put the border at the â on the western border of india and now where weâ ve aligned our definition of indo pacific to match that of japan and india and australia and so the quad members all have a common vision at least geographically of the indo pacific region question and so they define the indo pacific as going to east africa ambassador wells mm hmm ms ortagus okay weâ ll be â question can i ask one more question sorry i just popped in late sorry ms ortagus sure go ahead question i know i missed a little bit at the beginning but with regard to the american soldiers who have already been killed this year in afghanistan how has that specifically impacted the peace talks ms ortagus i think she already answered that so weâ ll send you to the transcript francesco question i was just wondering if you could switch off the record to update us on the u s taliban talks in doha even off the record ms ortagus no but thanks for trying no but iâ m going to check on senior administration official and see if heâ s one time and weâ ll be back in just a few minutes question i think i found the 60 million by the way ambassador wells did you question is it national procurement authority it was withheld because of concerns about transparency in accounting and managing finances ambassador wells yes yes ms ortagus thank you ambassador wells thank you laughter youâ re hired youâ re hired laughter
bloomberg terms of trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars sign up here for years as china has spent heavily in latin america colombia washington s closest regional ally has stood out as the major country with the smallest chinese investment that s changing and fast in the past several months chinese companies have reached deals on bogota s first metro line a railway to neighboring towns and a gold mining company amounting to a bigger total investment than over the previous 15 years according to the american enterprise institute s china investment tracker colombia s ties with the u s especially after the 2000 launch of the plan colombia counter narcotics program have kept it looking north but with u s dependability called into question in the trump era colombia is diversifying relationships according to margaret myers director of the asia and latin america program at the inter american dialogue a number of years ago there was concern about angering the united states by engaging more extensively with china myers said but certainly the u s has not been the same trustworthy and steadfast partner under the current leadership as it has been previously done nothing for us although colombian president ivan duque is deeply pro american and has teamed up with washington to isolate venezuela s nicolas maduro president donald trump attacked him last march for his failure to curb cocaine traffic trump said duque has done nothing for us and threatened to decertify colombia as a partner in the war on drugs that would lump it with venezuela meaning the u s would end most economic aid and automatically vote against colombian loans from organizations such as the world bank the white house backed away from that threat and during a visit to bogota this week secretary of state mike pompeo said the u s values the important friendship with colombia and will continue to prioritize it still colombians worry about the future story continues last july duque visited beijing where president xi jinping assured him that china would respect latin america s right to pick its own development path china the world s second largest economy is on a constant hunt for new markets and sources for natural resources even as some of its deals have fallen apart in poorer countries pan deng secretary general of the latin american studies center of charhar institute in beijing says that colombia has improved conditions for foreign investment and china is testing new models by joining consortia with foreign companies china says it isn t trying to compete with washington for political influence only to invest the trump administration has bristled at this however invoking the monroe doctrine a two century old claim of u s primacy in latin america this month chinese foreign minister wang yi dismissed the doctrine as out of date on thursday in davos duque was asked in an interview with bloomberg whether he s concerned about the rivalry we don t see this as a geopolitical battle he replied we see this as calling for international investment in the country the bogota metro was a public bid a chinese consortium won it because theirs was the better offer 5g washington is especially concerned about the building of 5g networks and china s ability to control how countries are wired or communicate internally according to a u s official huawei technologies co and zte corp both of which have been labeled potential security threats by the trump administration are already in colombia minister of commerce jose manuel restrepo said his goal isn t only more chinese investment but tourists and selling colombian farm products there there are growing chinese investments in smaller colombian industries such as hotels and

washington based think tank china is the biggest trading partner for brazil chile and peru now china is finding newly fertile ground in colombia which provides it mostly with crude oil colombia is not only about increasing access to basic commodities critical for chinese consumers but it s also about providing new opportunities for chinese firms that are otherwise running out of infrastructure

consortium led by mexican billionaire carlos slim s carso infraestructura y construccion with spanish and french firms bogota resembles xi an the company said it was attracted to bogota in part

few comments regarding some of what he wrote 1 black friday is an unfortunate term no matter how one looks at it check out its history perhaps it is not capitalism run amok but is surely consumerism run amok i don t care what people do on that friday but any sensible person should agree that the whole thanksgiving day should be left alone to enjoy and reflect and not corrupted by sales gimmickry i don t like using labels like capitalist or socialist as such are often a substitute for thinking however it s unavoidable 2 if one wanted to have a half decent understanding of these two words capitalism and socialism it would be helpful to first put them in historical context and be familiar with various people terms and concepts for starters adam smith and his book wealth of nations karl marx and his book das kapital and the communist manifesto by he and fredrich engels and two later economists john maynard keynes and milton friedman then one can move on to more modern terms conditions and functions in no particular order such as free market and competition earned and unearned income monopolies federal reserve oligarchies supply and demand hedge funds collusion mixed economy causes of recessions and stock market crashes price manipulation deceptive advertising gnp environmental degradation and on and on this is all what makes american capitalism go round at present i have no interest in praising the virtues of capitalism it gets enough elsewhere but will only say the same can be said of it as has been said of democracy it is the worst form of government except for all others 3 instructive also would be familiarity with the history of socialism and socialist communal experiments in america a local example is the lds church in its early attempt at economic communal living here in st george in 1874 called the united order going clear back to the early christians all larger scale serious attempts at socialist type communities have failed in one way or another likewise socialist movements and political parties in this country have never had much success and so called socialist and communist counties since the time of the bolshevik revolution in 1917 have all been miserable failures the ussr china russia cuba north korea venezuela and to save themselves have or will have had to revert to modified and mixed economies the simple truth is assuming basic human freedoms exist it doesn t matter as much what type of economic system a country has as is the existing level of just plain honesty and moral behavior in behalf of the common good that is what is of prime importance and unfortunately it is the nature of the beast which screws everything up 4 a few comments regarding the very merry christmas for investors no doubt this is the case but if we look at it a little more closely it isn t that merry for most folk the top 10 of the population hold 85 of the equity in the stock market and the next 10 hold about 10 which leaves the remaining 80 holding a mere 5 with the bottom 50 near zero to add to this the richest 10 of americans own 70 of the wealth while the bottom 50 hold only about 1 as to the five economic factors of success energy independence abundant capital reduced regulation technology advancements and reduced taxes these are complicated but there is also a down side to all of them there is much more than just oil importation we are dependent upon to make our economy function and even with oil because of varied refinery capacities and peculiarities of international market we are still dependent on oil import low interest rates are good for business but are a sour note for those dependent on income from interest and for workers today who look for a favorable return on their 401k as to reducing regulations it is always good to have an honest review of them with the public interest being the determining factor however there are many examples where much pain and suffering resulted from lack of regulation enforcement or unethical practices i e drug companies and wall street remember james madison s comment if men were angels regarding technology it seems to create about as many problems as resulting benefits but that we have to live with as to the nearly two hundred page 2017 tax reform act you can find whatever you are looking for as to who benefits but most of it has gone to corporations and the wealthy it is true our nation has been very blessed at least in the past but you can be guaranteed that christmas 2020 will not reflect the same if we do not get our fiscal and ethical house in order and quickly we are facing a financial train wreck with unimaginable consequences regarding our national debt and interest payments thereon foolish military interventions and endless wars are only creating more enemies and losing friends the global climate crisis will profoundly affect every aspect of our lives the american people are on the whole good and decent and will respond to clear and moral leadership this we do not have if socialism is ever a threat to america it will be because of the greed corruption and failure of those at the top there is a difference between the protection respect for private property and money and the worship thereof in the end the future of our children and grandchildren should be the single most important priority for all of us sadly that is not the case warren s wright is a resident of st george
abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers robert burns jill colvin christopher rugaber josh boak eric tucker and ellen knickmeyer in washington collin binkley in boston and amanda seitz in chicago contributed to this report
this article was produced by the independent media institute donald trump the self proclaimed great negotiator and author of the art of the deal promised to use his bargaining skills to help the american worker trump vowed to rewrite trade deals stanch the offshoring of u s jobs and reinvigorate american manufacturing his behavior tells a different story both of the trade deals he produced so far the original united states mexico canada agreement usmca and the phase one agreement with china failed american workers bad trade costs millions of american jobs trump s brand of deal making won t bring them back make no mistake trump inherited real trade problems for more than 20 years politicians of both parties failed to fix a broken system corporations exploited trade agreements to shift family sustaining manufacturing jobs to mexico china and other countries that pay workers low wages and deny them the protection of labor unions they made boatloads of money offshoring jobs but in the process they robbed u s workers of their livelihoods and hollowed out countless american communities decimating their tax bases and exposing them to epidemics of crime and opioids cheating compounded the job losses china subsidizes its industries manipulates its currency and then floods global markets with cheaply priced goods severely damaging u s manufacturing in steel aluminum paper furniture glass and other products work just started to dwindle recalled bill curtis who eventually lost his cloth cutting job at a lenoir north carolina furniture factory swept under by cheap chinese imports trump made fair trade and standing up to cheaters a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign he railed against the north american free trade agreement nafta which empowered corporations to shift more than one million manufacturing jobs to mexico he excoriated china for illegal trading practices that siphoned off more than three million american jobs and he vowed to stop the bleeding the labor movement was prepared to work with him to achieve its long sought goals but as president he let workers down america needs a comprehensive trade solution but trump s policy lacks vision the omission of enforceable labor standards in the original nafta enabled u s corporations to move manufacturing jobs south of the border and take advantage of mexican workers mexican workers make a few dollars an hour much less than their u s counterparts and they lack the protection of real labor unions companies make deals with protection unions to muzzle complaints about wages and dangerous working conditions workers have no voice and u s corporations get rich gaming this system but trump s version of the usmca also lacked specific mechanisms to enforce labor standards because he failed to deliver labor unions and democratic members of congress stepped into the breach and did the hard work of fixing the deal so that it provides real protections for workers and jobs in all three countries covered by the agreement congressional democrats traveled to san luis potosi mexico to visit a goodyear plant that pays some workers less than 2 an hour exposed them to hazardous conditions and fired dozens who dared to strike goodyear which laid off workers in virginia and alabama while operating the low cost mexican plant refused to let the congress members through the door but the visit showed the importance of incorporating worker protections into the usmca prominent democrats including sen sherrod brown of ohio rep rosa delauro of connecticut house ways and means committee chairman richard neal of massachusetts and house speaker nancy pelosi refused to pass the legislation until it represented a significant improvement over nafta under the revised version of the usmca mexico must follow through with promised labor reforms such as giving workers the right to organize or face enforcement actions when mexican workers join unions their wages will rise giving u s employers less incentive to relocate jobs in addition the revised version makes it easier for the u s to initiate complaints against mexican companies for trade violations provides for multinational inspections of mexican factories and gives the u s the authority to impose significant penalties and ultimately to block violators goods that s real enforcement congress passed the revised version of the usmca not trump s toothless version the deal is far from perfect but it s a significant improvement over nafta trump s failure to follow through on labor standards in the usmca showed his murky strategy on trade his use of tariffs does too in 2018 he slapped steel and aluminum tariffs on the whole world alienating global trading partners when the right approach would have been a strong surgical strike against china s dumping while the tariffs had some positive effects they re no substitute for big picture fixes trump has yet to deliver on january 15 trump unveiled phase one of a new trade deal with china it s little more than window dressing and an effort to defuse bilateral tensions during an election year the deal removes some tariffs on chinese goods and theoretically commits china to purchasing 200 billion in pork jets energy and other u s products it gives new market access to u s financial firms allowing wall street to line its pockets but it does nothing to address job loss the u s lost 3 7 million jobs to china since 2001 700 000 of them during trump s presidency and the trade deficit actually increased during the first two years of his term the loss of american jobs is no accident it s part of china s policy to destabilize competitors and boost its own power china subsidizes its industries giving companies raw materials land and cash then the companies sell their products abroad at prices that u s companies lacking government handouts can t match in addition china allows its industries to overproduce and flood global markets further driving down prices with gluts of steel aluminum and other products and it artificially depresses the value of its currency to encourage still more overseas sales these are the major problems that u s trade policy must address but trump s phase one deal doesn t resolve any of them instead before announcing the phase one agreement he backpedaled he rescinded china s designation as a currency manipulator now just like they did with the usmca labor unions and democratic members of congress must be ready to wade in and demand improvements to the china deal more jobs will disappear unless trump pursues a cohesive trade strategy that prioritizes the american worker now he s just helping to perpetuate the broken system he bitterly criticized
by hamid khan wazir advertisement islamabad pakistan may have weathered the worst of storms but would have to battle against brisk headwinds of political instability policy inconsistency challenging external environment slow economy and rising inflation among other distractions in its path to recovery in 2020 this was the conclusion of a report pakistan outlook 2020 politics economy security published by the islamabad policy institute ipi the report assessed pakistan s performance in various areas in 2019 and projected the likely future direction of events in 2020 besides looking at the potential challenges that could be encountered by the country it brought together essays written by experts and former policy makers on diverse subjects such as strategic environment foreign policy internal security economy and cyber security advertisement the foremost challenge for the government in 2020 would be to bring stability to the political system uncertainty on the political landscape could impede governance and economic reforms the report said it further noted that despite the government and the military appearing on the same page managing civil military relations would remain a major challenge this year political analyst mr farhan bokhari believes that as long as party structures remain weak and led by families where the highest offices have passed on in a hereditary manner political parties will remain inherently weak and unable to mature democratically a key implication of this situation has been the failure to build sustainable internal structures within political parties for discussions on key policy issues advertisement the report forecasts that the external environment would remain challenging this year with chances of limited conflict being imposed by india it called on the government to pursue a regional approach to safeguard the nascent afghan peace process from disruptions it moreover observed that the defining foreign policy challenge will come from middle east the report said that pakistan would have to cautiously navigate the growing strategic competition between beijing and washington for safeguarding and advancing china pakistan economic corridor cpec former foreign secretary salman bashir s assessment is that instability and uncertainties at the local regional and global level would continue to pose challenges to pakistan s diplomacy in the times ahead he called for a closer attention to pervasive sense of paralysis and loss of direction compounded by fragmentation in thought and actions and a visible deterioration in established societal values former defense secretary lt general retd asif yasin malik pointed out that pakistan faces multidimensional threats ranging from conventional military to nuclear to proxies to fifth generation which are both internal and external and also have complex interlinkages the report said that the implementation of reforms agenda agreed with international monetary fund will this year test decisiveness of pti government and pm khan on the economic front unlike anything in 2019 it is projected that pakistan s gdp growth would remain close to 2 5 because of slowdown specifically in large scale manufacturing and agriculture sectors meanwhile inflation would remain high hovering around 13 increase in power tariffs and higher oil prices could however cause inflation to shoot beyond these estimates furthermore it is anticipated that policy rates would be cut in 2020 because the current rates are unsustainable economist hussain haider said that having repeatedly returned from the brink of economic collapse it is high time pakistan chooses a more sustainable model of economic growth as the country faces a now or never situation needless to say this would require robust policy and implementation frameworks the celebrated economic turnaround has been seen numerous times before and should ideally not be cause for rejoice in 2020 fiscal reforms will determine the country s fortunes pakistan must ensure that meritocracy planning and education are given their due importance if it is to make its place on the world stage he maintained on the security front the report said that terrorism by religiously motivated and ethno nationalist groups would continue to pose a serious threat to internal security the other major challenge for the leas would come from the cyberspace meanwhile it cautioned that inimical forces would continue to exploit external vulnerabilities and internal discord and weaknesses what is referred to as fifth generation warfare to undermine stability
principal deputy assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs alice wells special briefing alice g wells principal deputy assistant secretary bureau of south and central asian affairs press correspondents room washington d c january 24 2020 ms ortagus so this entire briefing will be on the record alice just came back she s got a readout of her trip we obviously have another trip coming up so we ll try to get as many questions in after she finishes her opening statements go ahead ambassador wells great it was a long trip so i apologize for the long sort of framing remarks but then look forward to answering your questions so my first stop was in sri lanka i was joined by lisa curtis the deputy assistant to the president from the nsc and as you know sri lanka occupies some very important real estate in the indo pacific region and it s a country of increasing strategic importance in the indian ocean region and we had productive meetings with president gotabaya rajapaksa who was elected last november and his brother prime minister mahinda rajapaksa as well as the foreign minister representatives of the opposition as well as leaders of the tamil national alliance and civil society and i would say the election itself was noteworthy sri lanka is asia s oldest democracy the election was contested it was fair and it delivered a clear mandate to president rajapaksa in our meeting with the president lisa curtis and i conveyed a letter from president trump emphasizing the value that we place on continued engagement with sri lanka that s pursuing the path of reform and reconciliation and we really welcomed the president s statement that he wants to be president for all sri lankans we have compelling shared interests that include countering violent extremism strengthening maritime security preventing narcotics smuggling promoting investment and economic growth as part of a free and open indo pacific and ultimately the quality of our partnership will reflect our success in strengthening shared values including on the critical issue of healing the wounds of sri lanka s civil war from sri lanka we went to new delhi for the raisina dialogue the success of this annual conference reflects india s prominent role on the world s stage and at the heart of the indo pacific region in addition to joining deputy national security advisor matt pottinger s meetings with the indian national security advisor and foreign minister we met broadly with the ministry of external affairs the prime minister s office and the nsc as well as engaged opposition in civil society i think it s clear that india s broadening strategic horizons over the past two decades have resulted in a shift away from a passive foreign policy into one that more vigorously advances indian interests nowhere is that more true than in the indo pacific region whether it s in our growing maritime and naval cooperation the quad india s act east policy there s virtually no daylight in our approaches to the indo pacific deputy national security advisor pottinger s remarks at raisina endorsing an indo pacific region stretching from california to kilimanjaro only further reinforced the strategic convergence my official meetings also focused on how to build on the diplomatic and defense gains achieved during the 2 2 ministerial dialogue last december with continued progress on defense cooperation peacekeeping operations space counterterrorism trade people to people initiatives and more i would highlight that the quality and frequency of our naval cooperation especially information sharing has reached unprecedented levels we also remain focused on achieving a trade deal that promotes fair and reciprocal trade and my colleagues from ustr are in delhi now to continue this progress the visit also offered an opportunity to hear more regarding developments with india s citizenship amendment act which is undergoing i would say a vigorous democratic scrutiny whether it s in the streets by the political opposition media and the courts we continue to underscore the importance of the principle of equal protection under the law on jammu and kashmir i was pleased to see some incremental steps including the partial return of internet service in kashmir and the visit by our ambassador and other foreign diplomats to jammu and kashmir is something that i know was extensively covered in the press we see this as a useful step we also continue to urge the government to permit regular access by our diplomats and to move swiftly to release those political leaders detained without charge from new delhi i traveled to islamabad where i held meetings with government military civil society and business leaders at the top of the agenda was understanding how we can grow our bilateral relationship commensurate with the cooperation that we are achieving in promoting peace in afghanistan and regional stability we appreciate the steps pakistan has taken to advance the afghan peace process and pakistan has important leverage to promote lasting security and stability in afghanistan i welcomed efforts by pakistan to meet its counterterrorism financing obligations under fatf the financial action task force we strongly encourage pakistan to work with fatf and the international community to fully satisfy its action plan commitments completion of the fatf action plan is critical to pakistan s economic reform efforts including its imf program as well as for demonstrating sustained and irreversible action against all militant groups based in pakistan without distinction we ve seen obvious progress in our relations with pakistan from the high level engagement such as the president s warm and constructive meeting with prime minister khan at davos to the restoration of the international military education and training programs i had extensive conversations on how we can bolster our economic partnership where the u s is pakistan s largest export market largest trade partner and historically one of its most significant investors there are obvious synergies in energy and agriculture and opening pakistan s markets to american investments creates jobs and wealth without sacrificing standards or fueling corruption we re looking forward to welcoming 10 pakistani buyer delegations to the u s and five regional trade shows in 2020 which will build deeper relationships between u s and pakistani firms prime minister khan s economic reform efforts contributed to the world bank identifying it as one of the top 10 reformers globally in 2019 one last item of note is what was announced earlier today that secretary pompeo will travel to kazakhstan and uzbekistan february 1 3 following his stops in europe the secretary looks forward to traveling to central asia to discuss important economic security and religious freedom issues he ll also reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of the countries of central asia so let me stop here and take your questions ms ortagus go ahead matt question can i thanks i know this isn t your portfolio necessarily i m going to ask about north korea no laughter i m kidding ms ortagus you didn t have a question but can you if at all possible let us tell us what your understanding of where current things are with the afghanistan peace deal ambassador wells i mean the only thing i can note is that ambassador khalilzad and his team are in doha they are encouraging the taliban to make a commitment to a reduction in force that would allow afghans to sit at a negotiating table and so that process continues ms ortagus okay question may i ask a quick follow up ms ortagus yeah go ahead question sorry do you give any credence to the reports of more taliban violence coming out of afghanistan there have been some reports even just overnight that the taliban militants are killing civilians and other members of the ansf have you seen those reports do you can you confirm ambassador wells i have and the violence continues it obviously underscores why there needs to be a peace process and why the afghan people seek peace it also underscores the violence and the taliban s lack of inhibition in attacking civilians question the reason i ask if because of course as we know president trump said he would not allow some of the negotiations to go forward if the violence continued and that sort of spelled doom for the prospect of a peace process ambassador wells and that s why there has to be the focus on the reduction in violence that the afghan people can see and feel and appreciate ms ortagus go ahead question pakistan and china is certainly upset with your comments on cpec and pakistan anything you want to say after the whole chaos over there ambassador wells well as you ve heard secretary pompeo addressed more broadly we have concerns over one belt one road and the fact that projects under one belt one road often don t adhere to international standards sustainability labor environment and the argument that i was making in pakistan is that there are opportunities and should be opportunities for american investment american energy firms and manufacturers are interested in the pakistani market you have exxon mobil excelerate cargill honeywell all pursuing major new investments you have uber creating 80 000 jobs for pakistani youth and so as we do globally we argue in pakistan that that there you should adhere to the buyer beware that pakistan is a buyer these are not this is not grant assistance from china it s loans often not with concessional financing and pakistan should beware of the terms to make sure that they re getting the most for their money that brings the greatest economic prosperity question so you are not negating what exactly they re saying they are actually agitating on that ambassador wells what question they are kind of agitating on it like foreign officers saying they are it s meddling in their local affairs or the country affairs ms ortagus you re saying the chinese are saying that question they re endorsing it ms ortagus i don t think what s the so what s the question question would it be meddling in local affairs the government affairs or pakistan s affairs ambassador wells oh of course not this is pakistan s sovereign right to decide what investment it seeks and on what terms and a friend of pakistan we certainly urge that they take on investment projects that create wealth generate employment and are sustainable and think we have great options for the pakistani market question thank you ambassador ms ortagus go ahead question do you think the imf s funding could get affected if pakistan does not meet the fatf regulations or the rules ambassador wells i mean obviously if pakistan were not to meet fatf obligations or were to fail and be blacklisted that would be devastating for pakistan s economic reform program and for its ability to attract investors we ve been pleased to see progress by pakistan towards fulfilling fatf obligations there is a meeting underway currently in beijing where pakistan is presenting its actions to the task force and so i defer to that task force to make its evaluation but the more evidence of pakistan s seriousness in both documenting its economy and in shrinking the space for militants to be able to take advantage of pakistan s either banking system or territory the more confidence that the international community and business community will have in working with pakistan question because pakistan s foreign minister was in town last week and he urged that now united states should step up to help pakistan get it out of the gray list ambassador wells well fatf is a technical process there has been an action plan that was presented to pakistan it s a question of fulfilling the requirements that have been spelled out and that are asked of all countries in the international system so it s not a political process but we certainly support and stand ready to assist pakistan as it implements these obligations ms ortagus okay conor question ambassador wells back here two questions if i could the first one has there been any progress since the decision to withhold certain economic assistance to afghanistan have you seen constructive steps from the ghani administration are you considering other funds be withheld to send a message if not and then secondly it s been i guess nearly four months now since the national elections are you concerned that there s not been a clear outcome and at what point would you call for maybe a recount or a new election ambassador wells corruption is fighting corruption is a key element of all of our programs in afghanistan we try to ensure that u s taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately and with the desired effect we are constantly looking for ways to enhance the effectiveness of donor dollars and so when secretary pompeo outlined areas of shortcoming it reflected our concern about what continues to be endemic corruption in afghanistan i am pleased that in one area that the secretary underscored we did see progress by the government of afghanistan and 60 million in assistance was able to move forward and we certainly again encourage that the government as well as other implementers or recipients of assistance do everything possible to ensure that what are declining levels of economic assistance be put to maximum effect of the afghanistan has to transition to become self reliant and to develop a private sector with regard to elections i think it s very important that the contestants in the election are adhering to the process the independent election commission and the electoral complaints commission are working according to the electoral law they re processing the electoral complaints the electoral complaint commission has identified voting centers where they want to recount the ballots that process is proceeding and so our message is that it s better to get it right than better to finish than to finish it quickly and so we are supporting the electoral institutions of afghanistan ms ortagus anybody else question what was the one area that you said you saw some progress and it freed up 60 million ambassador wells yeah we will get you the specific i don t recall the program offhand but staff can provide that to you question is there anything big or some or that you would like to anything you would like to highlight about the trip upcoming in either kazakhstan or other than what you just said there is there in kazakhstan and uzbekistan is there any kind of deliverable that we should be expecting or looking for ambassador wells i think the secretary s visit is important because it comes in the context of the administration s central asia strategy which will shortly be rolled out which has important support again for the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of the central asian states he ll be hosting a meeting of the c5 so all of the foreign ministers of central asia which will be the second time he s done so in the year underscoring the importance we attach to also developing a regional identity among the central asian states at a time when we re working very closely with them to enhance regional connectivity and to help stitch afghanistan back into the region and so there s been important progress in enhancing trade and investment and support for afghanistan at the same time that there s been important developments in the modernization of the region thanks to the opening of uzbekistan with the passing of president karimov and president mirziyoyev s different stance towards regional integration question but my understanding has been in the past that the c5 when it gets together are generally talking about intra c5 opening up of trade and security counterterrorism that kind of thing is there also going to be ambassador wells and also question well right but also with afghanistan but is there anything u s that s less intra c5 and afghanistan and more c5 u s ambassador wells well i think counterterrorism cooperation we ve seen central asia become the leading they re the leading countries in reintegrating foreign terrorist fighters kazakhstan brought back 600 fighters and family members uzbekistan over a hundred tajikistan also close to a hundred and it s these countries that are actually going to be teaching us lessons from that reintegration process so ct will be an important part regional economic connectivity will be another and then economic modernization including a new project to enhance to create a regional electricity market question are you going on the trip ambassador wells i am question who came up with california to kilimanjaro ambassador wells i think it s witty ms ortagus i like the line ambassador wells it used to be bollywood to hollywood and now laughter no but what it ms ortagus i want to claim credit for it ambassador wells but what it does signify but thank you for noticing it because what it does laughter because what it does signify question except you have to spell california with a k laughter ambassador wells no but it signifies a definitional change because originally when we spoke about the indo pacific we did do hollywood to bollywood and put the border at the on the western border of india and now where we ve aligned our definition of indo pacific to match that of japan and india and australia and so the quad members all have a common vision at least geographically of the indo pacific region question and so they define the indo pacific as going to east africa ambassador wells mm hmm ms ortagus okay we ll be question can i ask one more question sorry i just popped in late sorry ms ortagus sure go ahead question i know i missed a little bit at the beginning but with regard to the american soldiers who have already been killed this year in afghanistan how has that specifically impacted the peace talks ms ortagus i think she already answered that so we ll send you to the transcript francesco question i was just wondering if you could switch off the record to update us on the u s taliban talks in doha even off the record ms ortagus no but thanks for trying no but i m going to check on and see if he s one time and we ll be back in just a few minutes question i think i found the 60 million by the way ambassador wells did you question is it national procurement authority it was withheld because of concerns about transparency in accounting and managing finances ambassador wells yes yes ms ortagus thank you ambassador wells thank you laughter you re hired you re hired laughter

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion

blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has

economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so

that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education

the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for

the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal

round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

the newest reading on consumer sentiment from the university of michigan s surveys of consumers shows that americans are feeling pretty upbeat these days two new metrics on consumer holiday season spending published this week found that consumer spending held up through the all important holiday season the national retail federation said that retail sales in november and december excluding restaurants gasoline and cars totaled just over 730 billion a year over year increase of 4 1 percent the commerce department said retail sales rose by 0 3 percent in december when cars and gasoline two volatile components were excluded retail sales grew by 0 5 percent for the month these figures were buoyed by steady consumer sentiment which remained roughly flat in december the baseline sentiment index ticked down a tiny bit from 99 3 to 99 1 and the outlook of current conditions rose by 0 3 points although the index of consumer expectations slipped by 0 7 points this still represents a year over year increase of 10 5 all three metrics consumer sentiment current economic conditions and consumer expectations have risen year over year reflecting a recovery from worries about the federal reserve and the government shutdown that started 2019 consumers will continue to sustain the expansion due to their favorable judgements about their current and prospective financial situation surveys of consumers chief economist richard curtin wrote in the accompanying analysis consumer spending is the pillar on which the economic expansion rests said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com there are a few good reasons for this optimism he added we ve got unemployment at a 50 year low growth in household income and growth in real spending power for most households the sharp downturn in growth apparently promised by the weakening of business surveys from the spring through the early fall has not materialized ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics wrote in a client note pantheon revised its 2020 gdp average quarterly growth forecasts upward from 1 5 percent to 2 percent as a result shepherdson added mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the meteoric rise in the stock market also contributes a potent wealth effect that can stimulate spending the wealth effect the rising stock market should be adding about half a point of gdp growth in 2019 and are on track to do about the same in 2020 he said that supports consumer confidence that helps in terms of cash stockholders can realize those gains it makes it easier for them to borrow zandi said the increase in borrowing rates also is helped along by a combination of low interest rates and economic optimism a forecast from credit bureau transunion predicted that americans will take on more debt this year including mortgages credit cars car and personal loans some households are in fact relying on debt to meet necessities but that s not the base case the majority of it is optimism with regard to employability income and the ability to repay that debt mcbride said according to a new bankrate survey 84 percent of people expect their finances to either improve or stay the same in 2020 only 1 in 6 americans expect their financial situation to get worse this year that ties back to that willingness to spend and comfort with taking on debt in moderation mcbride said 68 percent of economic output comes from consumer spending as long as that virtuous cycle retains intact we can keep recession at bay some market observers though argued that comparative sales should have been even higher given the economic fundamentals at play it s really an easier year over year comparison said camilla yanushevsky equity analyst at cfra research the partial government shutdown that stretched on for weeks worry about rising interest rate and waning tax cut stimulus all combined to put a damper on consumer activity towards the end of 2018 yanushevsky said nrf data found that holiday spending in 2018 grew at a rate of just over 2 percent i m surprised sales weren t stronger zandi said last december was a disaster i expected christmas sales because of the easy comparison to be closer to 5 percent many suspect trade could be putting a drag on recent results shepherdson flagged tariffs as a risk factor to continued economic growth both the direct effects of the tariffs a tax on consumers and businesses and the accompanying uncertainty will continue to constrain economic growth indefinitely he said yanushevsky pointed out that in spite of this week s china trade deal the majority of tariffs remain in place which constrains the rate of expansion we think that s going to stifle economic growth she said predicting that the impact to consumers will be magnified as more companies pass along their higher costs it s still chipping into people s wallets she said the trade war hurt manufacturing really hurt business investment in 2019 yanushevsky said predicting retail sales growth of 3 percent for this year we think there s going to be a more material spillover in 2020
i just wanted to share one of my all time favorite posts on blogging written by michael hyatt the post is titled 4 insights i gleaned from building my own platform i think i go back to it nearly quarterly for no other reason than it gives me hope what are the 4 insights 1 it takes longer than you think 2 you will probably hit an inflection point eventually 3 having a platform gives you a microphone you probably never thought possible 4 it is easier the second time around refer to the first two points as needed but read it for yourself from someone who is probably beyond where you dream of one day being

mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion

foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the

countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures

water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___

in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war

economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be

reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

growing relationship deposits a year long focus for our team checking savings and money market balances grew at a 19 annualized rate in the fourth quarter and non interest bearing deposit balances

strength of our company and our metrics remain superior for the fourth quarter non performing loans declined to 29 basis points of total loans held for investment and we reduced ore by over 1 million while reporting a net overall gain the last parcel of ore that we had was under contract at year end and subsequently closed with no additional loss we expect credit quality to remain strong in the

last year s first quarter dividend this dividend payable on february 14th marks the 19th consecutive quarter we paid a dividend to our shareholders i d now like to turn the call over to dan dellinger to discuss our financial results in more detail dan dan dellinger chief financial officer thanks devan and good morning everyone i will begin my comments on page 2 of our earnings presentation highlighting a few of our company s many accomplishments achieved during the transformational fourth quarter gaap net income for the fourth quarter was 4 1 million or 0 37 per diluted common share adjusted to 1 3 million of merger related expense net income of 5 3 million or 0 47 per diluted common share net interest income was driven by strong loan and core deposit growth for the year the company generated net income of 16 2 million or 1 44 per diluted common share we closed on a 60 million 10 year subordinated debt offering on december 13th and a coupon at 5 125 the interest rate is fixed for five years and floats for the final five years at the secured overnight financing rate plus 376 5 basis points the sub debt bolsters capital both at the bank and the holding company provides additional liquidity for our recent m a activity and other general company uses finally as devan noted we announced a definitive agreement to acquire first advantage bank in october and closed the acquisition of community bank trust on january 1st 2020 let s turn to page 3 and take a deeper look into the recent acquisitions and the strategic benefits each offer to our company community bank trust is headquartered in ashland city tennessee and reported total assets of 257 million at december 31st the acquisition of cbt extends our footprint into cheatham county and provides us with another source of quality low cost core deposits at year end cbt reported total deposits of 210 million at a cost of 52 basis points we are confident that our company s financial strength our team s focus on delivering excellent customer service and the range of products and solutions our bankers can offer our new clients will not only help retain the former cbt clients but also expand our presence in these new markets the acquisition closed on january 1st of this year and we completed the system conversion on january 21st first advantage bank is headquartered in clarksville tennessee and reported total consolidated assets of 738 million as of december 31st the acquisition of fab expands our footprint into the rapidly growing montgomery county and brings us a team of bankers that specialize in manufactured housing lending this niche lending offers strong returns and provides us with a potential new source of non interest income the benefit that brings to acquire first advantage bank was announced on october 23rd 2019 and we expect to be able to close early in the second quarter of 2020 we project both acquisitions will be accretive to earnings in 2020 and the full benefit realized in 2021 and our team is excited by the talented bankers that we will be adding to our company we look forward to building upon the success of all three companies achieved in 2019 on page 4 you will find some pro forma financial metrics for the three companies individually and what a combined entity would have looked like as of december 31st our combined entity would have reported total assets of 2 9 billion total loans held for investments of 2 2 billion and total deposits of 2 4 billion please note cbc recognized 732 000 of merger expenses in the fourth quarter and fab recognized 4 3 million of merger expenses in the fourth quarter returning focus back to reliant s fourth quarter financial results let s turn to page 5 and talk about our deposit portfolio which ended 2019 at 1 6 billion representing a four year compounded annual growth rate of 25 4 the 27 million quarter over quarter decline reported in the performance measure on the left side of the page doesn t truly reflect the outstanding performance our bankers delivered during the fourth quarter of 2019 generating 73 million of customer deposits and reducing our cost of deposits by 14 basis points 37 million of the growth in customer deposits occurred in non interest bearing deposits and interest bearing checking savings and money markets the increase in customer deposits coupled with the reduction of our investment portfolio allowed us to reduce our wholesale deposits by 103 million or 21 during the quarter taking our non core funding dependency ratio to 25 2 it s important to note that the success of our team achieved in the fourth quarter resulted from our bankers year long commitment to strengthen deposit relationships with current clients and emphasizing to all new relationships the importance of winning deposits we are proud of our team and look forward to their continued success in this very important initiative on the loan front our bankers capped off a successful 2019 by generating a franchise record 217 million in new loan production at a weighted average rate of 4 7 on page 6 of our presentation you should see you can see loans held for investment into 2019 at 1 4 billion representing a full year compounded annual growth rate of 22 9 our portfolio continues to carry considerable commercial real estate and construction loans primarily due to the continued high volume of new construction in our middle tennessee and chattanooga markets moving to the right side of page 6 loan yield continues to be impacted by the fed s recent rate cuts as our total loan yield was down to 11 basis points and core loan yield was down 19 basis points from the third quarter we expected loan yield will begin to stabilize in the first quarter of 2020 as no further rate cuts are expected in the immediate future moving to page 7 a loan loss provision of 406 000 was taken during the fourth quarter taking loans to 0 89 of total loans held for investment at december 31st this becomes 1 1 when unamortized purchase loan discounts are added back our management team is comfortable that we are adequately reserved at december 31st as always been the case credit quality remains a top priority for our board and management at december 31st our credit quality measures remained pristine non performing loans accounted for just 29 basis points of total loans held for investment and non performing assets accounted for just 26 basis points of total assets fourth quarter 2019 charge offs totaled 420 000 with the company ending the year in a net recovery position during the quarter we disposed two other real estate properties totaling 1 3 million realizing a gain on disposal of 56 000 after including the writedown of the remaining property by 100 000 remaining other real estate properties on december 31st was under contract and disposed at the end of first quarter of 2020 with no additional loss as i previously mentioned commercial real estate and construction loans continue to increase as a percentage of our total capital both concentrations remain within board approved limits to appropriately manage the potential risks associated with this type of lending our bank is focused on lending to the first five group of borrowers and industries within these loan segments minimizing exposure to any one industry or borrower concentrations are geographically depicted on page 8 construction land and land development loans were 124 of total capital up 5 9 quarter over quarter essentially flat with the third quarter management and the board of directors are confident that the appropriate risk management controls are in place and remain comfortable with these concentration levels at december 31st net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3 46 down 5 basis points quarter over quarter the primary factor impacting margin was the 60 million subject to issuance that closed on december 13th and increased fourth quarter interest expense by 152 000 creating 4 basis points of margin contraction margin was also affected by declining rate environment which have slightly more impact on the asset side due to higher levels of variable rate instruments than on the liability side where competition and time deposits issued during higher rate cycles customer deposit rates a bit more elevated net interest income for the company for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 15 2 million a 455 000 or 3 1 increase over the third quarter the performance measure on the bottom left of page 9 details net interest income for the core bank which excludes interest on loans held for sale total interest income was 21 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 up 300 000 or 1 4 from the third quarter generating a yield on earning assets of 4 82 but still a 16 basis point quarter over quarter decline loans held for investment decreased 11 basis points quarter over quarter the taxable securities portfolio declined by 45 basis points quarter over quarter and mortgage loans held for sale declined by almost 100 basis points the decline in yield on taxable investments can be attributed to our ongoing effort to rotate funding from our bond portfolio to our loan portfolio over the course of the fourth quarter the company reduced the investment portfolio by 37 million and rotated the proceeds into new lines picking up between 110 and 120 basis points the quarter over quarter decline in yield on loans held for sale was due to the increased holdings of corresponding loans and changing market interest rates declining interest rates did provide some relief on the deposit side where deposits quarter over quarter increased to 49 1 million in average interest bearing liabilities interest expense on deposits declined by 216 000 267 000 or 4 6 to 5 6 million our cost of deposits declined by 14 basis points quarter over quarter to 1 62 the decline was driven by the changing mix of our deposit portfolio as a quarterly average balances for interest bearing checking savings and money market accounts increased a combined 32 6 million and noninterest bearing deposits increased by 22 7 million our decision to maintain shorter durations for wholesale deposits continue to provide benefit as the weighted average rate for wholesale funding dropped 26 basis points to 1 85 by the end of the fourth quarter non interest income for the company was 4 6 million for the fourth quarter up 1 8 million from the third quarter the primary factors driving the increase were 1 3 million gain realized on the securities portfolio the recognition of a 190 000 incentive earned upon signing a new marketing agreement with mastercard and a 350 000 quarter over quarter increase in the gains realized on the sale of mortgage loans non interest expense for the company was 15 million up almost 2 million from the third quarter of 2019 however the 1 3 million of merger expenses realized during the quarter is responsible for much of this increase other significant contributors to the quarter over quarter increase were 353 000 increase in fdic insurance premiums which returned to normal levels in the fourth quarter after taking a credit taken in september resulted in a negative expense for the third quarter additionally as mentioned earlier 100 000 valuation allowance was taken against the remaining other real estate properties so the carrying value of the property reflected the agreed upon sales price for the transaction which closed in january of 2020 the performance measure on the bottom line side of page 9 details the fourth quarter non interest expense for the core bank which core was up 800 000 or 8 2 to 10 5 million this was impacted by the previously mentioned fdic insurance premium and the evaluation adjustment and evaluation adjustment for the other real estate property additionally salary expenses were up quarter over quarter due primarily to an initiative to bring it support in house the net savings to the company for this initiative is expected to be approximately 360 000 annually for the combined company these savings will begin in the first quarter of 2020 reliant mortgage ventures our joint venture mortgage company reported a net loss of 1 2 million on revenue of 1 9 million and non interest expense of 3 2 million just a reminder for the terms of our joint venture agreement any losses by reliant mortgage ventures are funded by a partner via a capital injection so r d losses do not impact the company s net income but do impact the reported efficiency ratio which was 80 9 for the company but adjusted 63 3 for the core bank i want to conclude my remarks this morning by discussing the shareholder value our team has created over the past quarter please turn to page 11 of the presentation for a summary of key performance measures i would like to specifically highlight tangible book value which increased 0 37 or 9 8 annualized from the third quarter and return on tangible common equity which increased 10 basis points and reported 187 basis points from income as adjusted for market during the fourth quarter we successfully completed the 60 million subordinated debt offering which provides liquidity we need during this period of significant m a activity and bolsters our capital of both the company and the bank this concludes my presentation devan back to you for closing comments devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer thanks dan as we wrap up 2019 and look ahead to 2020 i want to take a few minutes to talk about some of our key strategic initiatives sustained organic growth within our franchise footprint is at the top of the list our markets in middle tennessee including clarksville and cheatham county and chattanooga continue to show healthy growth low taxes moderate living costs and robust industries such as healthcare tourism and entertainment auto manufacturing continue to generate new jobs and end migration chattanooga where we now have over 90 million in loans was recently listed by realtor com at no 4 in the country among the top housing markets for 2020 m a will continue to be a key component of our strategy much like the two transactions we announced in 2019 one of which we completed earlier this month our focus will remain on banks located in the middle tennessee and chattanooga areas where we can gain scale and leverage our existing franchise those opportunities will generally be over 500 million in assets with attractive funding basis and strong profitability the transaction must be immediately accretive to earnings with minimal tangible book value dilution credit quality remains outstanding with non performing assets past due loans criticized loans and net charge offs near cycle lows we are convinced that our practice of making loans to customers in our market who we can build meaningful relationships with will sustain superior asset quality even in a softer economy i d like to close by thanking our entire team for their hard work and many contributions to our success in 2019 and i m excited to see what our company can do in 2020 operator that completes my remarks for this morning s call and i d like to open the line up for questions questions answers operator and we ll go first to kevin fitzsimmons with d a davidson devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer good morning kevin kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys how are you devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer good kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst hey devan i wanted to ask about you know obviously there s bank win in general there s been a lot of large transactions going on but in your core market in middle tennessee that was one just announced and i wanted to get your feeling on what kind of opportunity there could be for you guys to take advantage of that whether that be customers and or talent or is that something just not as relevant on your radar screen devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer well i think it s very relevant i mean there have been two deals announced this week one is probably not as important because it involved two banks that are kind of outside of our market area the first bank and franklin synergy deal is certainly a good opportunity we re both franklin synergy and reliant are both headquartered in williamson county we ve got a lot of market overlap just in williamson county they are also in rutherford county where murfreesboro is and we established a full service office in murfreesboro last year so i think whether it s customers or certainly opportunities for people there are going to be plenty opportunities for us going forward we like disruption in the market and we plan to take advantage of it kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst great and devan with the your comments on m a with the next deal closing early second quarter realistically are you once that deal closes or maybe you don t even wait for that to close or when would you say the door is open to be looking to announce further deals is it or is it more realistic to think about that as more second half of the year devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer probably second half of the year you know i really wouldn t want to comment on any announcements but there is we have conversations on a regular basis with many different banks and i suspect there will be other opportunities and within the defined footprint that we ve established this year we certainly want to get the both the ones that we have behind us we ve successfully converted one everything is looking really good with first advantage and as you ve seen as we ve all seen m a activity picked up in tennessee in the last couple of years i think there are reasons some of the community banks in our markets will want to look for a strategic partner and we feel like we provide a really good opportunity for that kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst ok that s all i had thanks very much devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer thanks kevin operator we ll take our next question from stephen scouten with piper sandler devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer hey stephen how are you this morning stephen scouten piper sandler analyst hey good morning you know devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i like the new 5 stephen scouten piper sandler analyst i m still getting used to it but we ll get there i like it so i m curious just on the growth front had a really fantastic order here this quarter and i know last quarter you had spoken to the idea that growth may slow a little bit as you work to integrate first advantage in particular i think so how can we think about growth for the full year and do you still expect that to kind of trail off a little bit just as the focus shifts devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer if you re talking about loans stephen i m still seeing a pretty robust economy in middle tennessee and whether it s the community bank family or the first advantage bank family both i think are showing some healthy growth benefit from being in the nashville msa so we re probably looking at a little bit stronger growth track for us this year than i had originally forecast i think i originally said 10 somewhere in that range there s a good possibility we might be slightly higher than that the production that we had in the fourth quarter which was really strong it was 200 over 200 million and a lot of those loans didn t fund when they closed or funded very small amounts so we ll have funding up on those credits as we move through the year and we finished 2019 with a very solid pipeline going into 2020 so i could easily see us absent some unexpected paydowns i could easily see us moving a little bit north of 10 this year stephen scouten piper sandler analyst ok great that s helpful and then i m curious around the nim just kind of what you think the forward trends will be kind of 1q 20 with the cbt and the numbers and then kind of later in the year pro forma for first advantage and then within that just curious if there s been any abatement of the competitive pressures on deposits in your markets yet devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i ll let dan address the nim and then i ll talk about the competitive situation when he gets finished dan dellinger chief financial officer yes so stephen as you know in the fourth quarter the sub debt had about a 4 basis point impact on our margin we expect that to be around 16 basis points in q1 and then trailing off to about 11 basis points as we enter q4 that will include obviously the fabk acquisition we see loan rates stabilizing pretty much now and we re beginning to see continued we re not beginning to see but we re seeing continued reductions in our cost the cost of funds as a result of our lower dependency on wholesale funding as you noted in the fourth quarter that dropped significantly and we used we rotated out of cdt s loan portfolio excuse me investment portfolio to 60 million and it will be probably the same with fabk s portfolio so that s going to continue to have a positive effect on the wholesale funding front and those costs we re seeing a reduction to about 160 as it currently stands so i m just going to say a lot of moving parts as we move forward i think we ll see a slight contraction in q1 mainly as a result of the sub debt the cbt acquisition will have a slightly positive effect but again it s such a small acquisition in relation to our bank s size total asset size so it s not going to be a big contributor fabk on the other hand should be a pretty good contributor probably 12 basis points or so to our margin devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer and on the competitive front stephen it s still competitive out there i think the big change from let s say a year ago to where we are now is we re not really seeing these out of market solicitations for money market accounts at rates that in some cases we re in the 240 to 250 range so those have basically dried up and if you kind of follow what some of those companies have done with their rates they ve really cut them back pretty substantially i think deposits are still going to be competitive in this market mainly because the economy is strong and earning asset growth has been continued to be strong so you ve got to fund it some way but i do think that we ll see as far as rate specials go anyway we ll see some abatement there listen we all want to make money and the best way to do that is to keep your margins stable and so i think we ll see some probably some more rational pricing the competition i think will be will still be strong but maybe we ll see some a little bit more rational pricing we ve already started lowering our some of our money market rates and have seen no attrition no customer attrition from that so i m encouraged by it but i don t think until the economy starts to weaken and loan growth in this area starts to slack you re going to see much lower competition and frankly that was the big benefit that we saw in certainly in community bank because the cost of funds was so low as we think about m a that gets to be an important consideration and so that will be part of kind of the way we evaluate what we want to do and who we want to partner with going forward stephen scouten piper sandler analyst ok great yeah that s very helpful thanks and then maybe one just last clarifier there dan when you said the sub debt will hit 16 basis points in one quarter are you saying that 16 basis points of incremental nim pressure and that will kind of take the 3 46 to around 3 30 all else equal dan dellinger chief financial officer yes stephen scouten piper sandler analyst ok great well thank you operator we ll go next to feddie strickland with janney feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst hey guys good morning devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer hey feddie feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst just had a quick question i was wondering whether you re actively using or discussing putting floors in the new loan production with the prospect of additional rate cuts down the road devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer we try to bid on every commercial loan we make it was a little bit of a challenge kind of second half of last year because i think we all well we got rate we got more rate cuts from the fed than we thought we were going to get and so especially on floating rate loans where we would put a floor in that was maybe 25 or 50 basis points below the note rate we all of a sudden and our customers actually all of a sudden saw their the rate on their loan was had a floor to it so it s something we try to do and i think just fairly consistently we ll go in there with a floor of on a floating rate loan of 25 to 50 basis points lower than the note rate that s about right now we can t do it every time but we certainly try to feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst got it and i guess just one more for me some mortgage was up a bit but compared with prior quarter and i can t remember if you guys addressed this earlier but do you expect to be able to kind of continue to grow that line i know it s going to be volatile but i was just wondering what your outlook was there devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we re expecting to see an increase i think i don t know that we ll see much in the first quarter there s some seasonality in this business feddie and typically the fourth quarter and the first quarter are a little bit slower in terms of originations but we think we ll see as we especially as we get into the second quarter and third quarter this year we ll see some increases in mortgage revenue i mean rates are still really low and we ve got a lot of people out there working hard on it refi activity is staying fairly good but in our markets we re really more dependent on purchase money type mortgages with an economy that sees a lot of new homes being built and sold feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst gotcha thank you guys

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

or 1 44 per diluted common share we closed on a 60 million 10 year subordinated debt offering on december 13th and a coupon at 5 125 the interest rate is fixed for five years and floats for the final five years at the secured overnight financing rate plus 376 5 basis points the sub debt bolsters capital both at the bank and the holding company provides additional liquidity for our recent m a activity and other general company uses finally as devan noted we announced a definitive agreement to acquire first advantage bank in october and closed the acquisition of community bank trust on january 1st 2020 let s turn to page 3 and take a deeper look into the recent acquisitions and the strategic benefits each offer to our company community bank trust is headquartered in ashland city tennessee and reported total assets of 257 million at december 31st the acquisition of cbt extends our footprint into cheatham county and provides us with another source of quality low cost core deposits at year end cbt reported total deposits of 210 million at a cost of 52 basis points we are confident that our company s financial strength our team s focus on delivering excellent customer service and the range of products and solutions our bankers can offer our new clients will not only help retain the former cbt clients but also expand our presence in these new markets the acquisition closed on january 1st of this year and we completed the system conversion on january 21st first advantage bank is headquartered in clarksville tennessee and reported total consolidated assets of 738 million as of december 31st the acquisition of fab expands our footprint into the rapidly growing montgomery county and brings us a team of bankers that specialize in manufactured housing lending this niche lending offers strong returns and provides us with a potential new source of non interest income the benefit that brings to acquire first advantage bank was announced on october 23rd 2019 and we expect to be able to close early in the second quarter of 2020 we project both acquisitions will be accretive to earnings in 2020 and the full benefit realized in 2021 and our team is excited by the talented bankers that we will be adding to our company we look forward to building upon the success of all three companies achieved in 2019 on page 4 you will find some pro forma financial metrics for the three companies individually and what a combined entity would have looked like as of december 31st our combined entity would have reported total assets of 2 9 billion total loans held for investments of 2 2 billion and total deposits of 2 4 billion please note cbc recognized 732 000 of merger expenses in the fourth quarter and fab recognized 4 3 million of merger expenses in the fourth quarter returning focus back to reliant s fourth quarter financial results let s turn to page 5 and talk about our deposit portfolio which ended 2019 at 1 6 billion representing a four year compounded annual growth rate of 25 4 the 27 million quarter over quarter decline reported in the performance measure on the left side of the page doesn t truly reflect the outstanding performance our bankers delivered during the fourth quarter of 2019 generating 73 million of customer deposits and reducing our cost of deposits by 14 basis points 37 million of the growth in customer deposits occurred in non interest bearing deposits and interest bearing checking savings and money markets the increase in customer deposits coupled with the reduction of our investment portfolio allowed us to reduce our wholesale deposits by 103 million or 21 during the quarter taking our non core funding dependency ratio to 25 2 it s important to note that the success of our team achieved in the fourth quarter resulted from our bankers year long commitment to strengthen deposit relationships with current clients and emphasizing to all new relationships the importance of winning deposits we are proud of our team and look forward to their continued success in this very important initiative on the loan front our bankers capped off a successful 2019 by generating a franchise record 217 million in new loan production at a weighted average rate of 4 7 on page 6 of our presentation you should see you can see loans held for investment into 2019 at 1 4 billion representing a full year compounded annual growth rate of 22 9 our portfolio continues to carry considerable commercial real estate and construction loans primarily due to the continued high volume of new construction in our middle tennessee and chattanooga markets moving to the right side of page 6 loan yield continues to be impacted by the fed s recent rate cuts as our total loan yield was down to 11 basis points and core loan yield was down 19 basis points from the third quarter we expected loan yield will begin to stabilize in the first quarter of 2020 as no further rate cuts are expected in the immediate future moving to page 7 a loan loss provision of 406 000 was taken during the fourth quarter taking loans to 0 89 of total loans held for investment at december 31st this becomes 1 1 when unamortized purchase loan discounts are added back our management team is comfortable that we are adequately reserved at december 31st as always been the case credit quality remains a top priority for our board and management at december 31st our credit quality measures remained pristine non performing loans accounted for just 29 basis points of total loans held for investment and non performing assets accounted for just 26 basis points of total assets fourth quarter 2019 charge offs totaled 420 000 with the company ending the year in a net recovery position during the quarter we disposed two other real estate properties totaling 1 3 million realizing a gain on disposal of 56 000 after including the writedown of the remaining property by 100 000 remaining other real estate properties on december 31st was under contract and disposed at the end of first quarter of 2020 with no additional loss as i previously mentioned commercial real estate and construction loans continue to increase as a percentage of our total capital both concentrations remain within board approved limits to appropriately manage the potential risks associated with this type of lending our bank is focused on lending to the first five group of borrowers and industries within these loan segments minimizing exposure to any one industry or borrower concentrations are geographically depicted on page 8 construction land and land development loans were 124 of total capital up 5 9 quarter over quarter essentially flat with the third quarter management and the board of directors are confident that the appropriate risk management controls are in place and remain comfortable with these concentration levels at december 31st net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3 46 down 5 basis points quarter over quarter the primary factor impacting margin was the 60 million subject to issuance that closed on december 13th and increased fourth quarter interest expense by 152 000 creating 4 basis points of margin contraction margin was also affected by declining rate environment which have slightly more impact on the asset side due to higher levels of variable rate instruments than on the liability side where competition and time deposits issued during higher rate cycles customer deposit rates a bit more elevated net interest income for the company for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 15 2 million a 455 000 or 3 1 increase over the third quarter the performance measure on the bottom left of page 9 details net interest income for the core bank which excludes interest on loans held for sale total interest income was 21 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 up 300 000 or 1 4 from the third quarter generating a yield on earning assets of 4 82 but still a 16 basis point quarter over quarter decline loans held for investment decreased 11 basis points quarter over quarter the taxable securities portfolio declined by 45 basis points quarter over quarter and mortgage loans held for sale declined by almost 100 basis points the decline in yield on taxable investments can be attributed to our ongoing effort to rotate funding from our bond portfolio to our loan portfolio over the course of the fourth quarter the company reduced the investment portfolio by 37 million and rotated the proceeds into new lines picking up between 110 and 120 basis points the quarter over quarter decline in yield on loans held for sale was due to the increased holdings of corresponding loans and changing market interest rates declining interest rates did provide some relief on the deposit side where deposits quarter over quarter increased to 49 1 million in average interest bearing liabilities interest expense on deposits declined by 216 000 267 000 or 4 6 to 5 6 million our cost of deposits declined by 14 basis points quarter over quarter to 1 62 the decline was driven by the changing mix of our deposit portfolio as a quarterly average balances for interest bearing checking savings and money market accounts increased a combined 32 6 million and noninterest bearing deposits increased by 22 7 million our decision to maintain shorter durations for wholesale deposits continue to provide benefit as the weighted average rate for wholesale funding dropped 26 basis points to 1 85 by the end of the fourth quarter non interest income for the company was 4 6 million for the fourth quarter up 1 8 million from the third quarter the primary factors driving the increase were 1 3 million gain realized on the securities portfolio the recognition of a 190 000 incentive earned upon signing a new marketing agreement with mastercard and a 350 000 quarter over quarter increase in the gains realized on the sale of mortgage loans non interest expense for the company was 15 million up almost 2 million from the third quarter of 2019 however the 1 3 million of merger expenses realized during the quarter is responsible for much of this increase other significant contributors to the quarter over quarter increase were 353 000 increase in fdic insurance premiums which returned to normal levels in the fourth quarter after taking a credit taken in september resulted in a negative expense for the third quarter additionally as mentioned earlier 100 000 valuation allowance was taken against the remaining other real estate properties so the carrying value of the property reflected the agreed upon sales price for the transaction which closed in january of 2020 the performance measure on the bottom line side of page 9 details the fourth quarter non interest expense for the core bank which core was up 800 000 or 8 2 to 10 5 million this was impacted by the previously mentioned fdic insurance premium and the evaluation adjustment and evaluation adjustment for the other real estate property additionally salary expenses were up quarter over quarter due primarily to an initiative to bring it support in house the net savings to the company for this initiative is expected to be approximately 360 000 annually for the combined company these savings will begin in the first quarter of 2020 reliant mortgage ventures our joint venture mortgage company reported a net loss of 1 2 million on revenue of 1 9 million and non interest expense of 3 2 million just a reminder for the terms of our joint venture agreement any losses by reliant mortgage ventures are funded by a partner via a capital injection so r d losses do not impact the company s net income but do impact the reported efficiency ratio which was 80 9 for the company but adjusted 63 3 for the core bank i want to conclude my remarks this morning by discussing the shareholder value our team has created over the past quarter please turn to page 11 of the presentation for a summary of key performance measures i would like to specifically highlight tangible book value which increased 0 37 or 9 8 annualized from the third quarter and return on tangible common equity which increased 10 basis points and reported 187 basis points from income as adjusted for market during the fourth quarter we successfully completed the 60 million subordinated debt offering which provides liquidity we need during this period of significant m a activity and bolsters our capital of both the company and the bank this concludes my presentation devan back to you for closing comments devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer thanks dan as we wrap up 2019 and look ahead to 2020 i want to take a few minutes to talk about some of our key strategic initiatives sustained organic growth within our franchise footprint is at the top of the list our markets in middle tennessee including clarksville and cheatham county and chattanooga continue to show healthy growth low taxes moderate living costs and robust industries such as healthcare tourism and entertainment auto manufacturing continue to generate new jobs and end migration chattanooga where we now have over 90 million in loans was recently listed by realtor com at no 4 in the country among the top housing markets for 2020 m a will continue to be a key component of our strategy much like the two transactions we announced in 2019 one of which we completed earlier this month our focus will remain on banks located in the middle tennessee and chattanooga areas where we can gain scale and leverage our existing franchise those opportunities will generally be over 500 million in assets with attractive funding basis and strong profitability the transaction must be immediately accretive to earnings with minimal tangible book value dilution credit quality remains outstanding with non performing assets past due loans criticized loans and net charge offs near cycle lows we are convinced that our practice of making loans to customers in our market who we can build meaningful relationships with will sustain superior asset quality even in a softer economy i d like to close by thanking our entire team for their hard work and many contributions to our success in 2019 and i m excited to see what our company can do in 2020 operator that completes my remarks for this morning s call and i d like to open the line up for questions questions answers operator and we ll go first to kevin fitzsimmons with d a davidson devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer good morning kevin kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys how are you devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer good kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst hey devan i wanted to ask about you know obviously there s bank win in general there s been a lot of large transactions going on but in your core market in middle tennessee that was one just announced and i wanted to get your feeling on what kind of opportunity there could be for you guys to take advantage of that whether that be customers and or talent or is that something just not as relevant on your radar screen devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer well i think it s very relevant i mean there have been two deals announced this week one is probably not as important because it involved two banks that are kind of outside of our market area the first bank and franklin synergy deal is certainly a good opportunity we re both franklin synergy and reliant are both headquartered in williamson county we ve got a lot of market overlap just in williamson county they are also in rutherford county where murfreesboro is and we established a full service office in murfreesboro last year so i think whether it s customers or certainly opportunities for people there are going to be plenty opportunities for us going forward we like disruption in the market and we plan to take advantage of it kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst great and devan with the your comments on m a with the next deal closing early second quarter realistically are you once that deal closes or maybe you don t even wait for that to close or when would you say the door is open to be looking to announce further deals is it or is it more realistic to think about that as more second half of the year devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer probably second half of the year you know i really wouldn t want to comment on any announcements but there is we have conversations on a regular basis with many different banks and i suspect there will be other opportunities and within the defined footprint that we ve established this year we certainly want to get the both the ones that we have behind us we ve successfully converted one everything is looking really good with first advantage and as you ve seen as we ve all seen m a activity picked up in tennessee in the last couple of years i think there are reasons some of the community banks in our markets will want to look for a strategic partner and we feel like we provide a really good opportunity for that kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst ok that s all i had thanks very much devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer thanks kevin operator we ll take our next question from stephen scouten with piper sandler devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer hey stephen how are you this morning stephen scouten piper sandler analyst hey good morning you know devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i like the new 5 stephen scouten piper sandler analyst i m still getting used to it but we ll get there i like it so i m curious just on the growth front had a really fantastic order here this quarter and i know last quarter you had spoken to the idea that growth may slow a little bit as you work to integrate first advantage in particular i think so how can we think about growth for the full year and do you still expect that to kind of trail off a little bit just as the focus shifts devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer if you re talking about loans stephen i m still seeing a pretty robust economy in middle tennessee and whether it s the community bank family or the first advantage bank family both i think are showing some healthy growth benefit from being in the nashville msa so we re probably looking at a little bit stronger growth track for us this year than i had originally forecast i think i originally said 10 somewhere in that range there s a good possibility we might be slightly higher than that the production that we had in the fourth quarter which was really strong it was 200 over 200 million and a lot of those loans didn t fund when they closed or funded very small amounts so we ll have funding up on those credits as we move through the year and we finished 2019 with a very solid pipeline going into 2020 so i could easily see us absent some unexpected paydowns i could easily see us moving a little bit north of 10 this year stephen scouten piper sandler analyst ok great that s helpful and then i m curious around the nim just kind of what you think the forward trends will be kind of 1q 20 with the cbt and the numbers and then kind of later in the year pro forma for first advantage and then within that just curious if there s been any abatement of the competitive pressures on deposits in your markets yet devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i ll let dan address the nim and then i ll talk about the competitive situation when he gets finished dan dellinger chief financial officer yes so stephen as you know in the fourth quarter the sub debt had about a 4 basis point impact on our margin we expect that to be around 16 basis points in q1 and then trailing off to about 11 basis points as we enter q4 that will include obviously the fabk acquisition we see loan rates stabilizing pretty much now and we re beginning to see continued we re not beginning to see but we re seeing continued reductions in our cost the cost of funds as a result of our lower dependency on wholesale funding as you noted in the fourth quarter that dropped significantly and we used we rotated out of cdt s loan portfolio excuse me investment portfolio to 60 million and it will be probably the same with fabk s portfolio so that s going to continue to have a positive effect on the wholesale funding front and those costs we re seeing a reduction to about 160 as it currently stands so i m just going to say a lot of moving parts as we move forward i think we ll see a slight contraction in q1 mainly as a result of the sub debt the cbt acquisition will have a slightly positive effect but again it s such a small acquisition in relation to our bank s size total asset size so it s not going to be a big contributor fabk on the other hand should be a pretty good contributor probably 12 basis points or so to our margin devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer and on the competitive front stephen it s still competitive out there i think the big change from let s say a year ago to where we are now is we re not really seeing these out of market solicitations for money market accounts at rates that in some cases we re in the 240 to 250 range so those have basically dried up and if you kind of follow what some of those companies have done with their rates they ve really cut them back pretty substantially i think deposits are still going to be competitive in this market mainly because the economy is strong and earning asset growth has been continued to be strong so you ve got to fund it some way but i do think that we ll see as far as rate specials go anyway we ll see some abatement there listen we all want to make money and the best way to do that is to keep your margins stable and so i think we ll see some probably some more rational pricing the competition i think will be will still be strong but maybe we ll see some a little bit more rational pricing we ve already started lowering our some of our money market rates and have seen no attrition no customer attrition from that so i m encouraged by it but i don t think until the economy starts to weaken and loan growth in this area starts to slack you re going to see much lower competition and frankly that was the big benefit that we saw in certainly in community bank because the cost of funds was so low as we think about m a that gets to be an important consideration and so that will be part of kind of the way we evaluate what we want to do and who we want to partner with going forward stephen scouten piper sandler analyst ok great yeah that s very helpful thanks and then maybe one just last clarifier there dan when you said the sub debt will hit 16 basis points in one quarter are you saying that 16 basis points of incremental nim pressure and that will kind of take the 3 46 to around 3 30 all else equal dan dellinger chief financial officer yes stephen scouten piper sandler analyst ok great well thank you operator we ll go next to feddie strickland with janney feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst hey guys good morning devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer hey feddie feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst just had a quick question i was wondering whether you re actively using or discussing putting floors in the new loan production with the prospect of additional rate cuts down the road devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer we try to bid on every commercial loan we make it was a little bit of a challenge kind of second half of last year because i think we all well we got rate we got more rate cuts from the fed than we thought we were going to get and so especially on floating rate loans where we would put a floor in that was maybe 25 or 50 basis points below the note rate we all of a sudden and our customers actually all of a sudden saw their the rate on their loan was had a floor to it so it s something we try to do and i think just fairly consistently we ll go in there with a floor of on a floating rate loan of 25 to 50 basis points lower than the note rate that s about right now we can t do it every time but we certainly try to feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst got it and i guess just one more for me some mortgage was up a bit but compared with prior quarter and i can t remember if you guys addressed this earlier but do you expect to be able to kind of continue to grow that line i know it s going to be volatile but i was just wondering what your outlook was there devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we re expecting to see an increase i think i don t know that we ll see much in the first quarter there s some seasonality in this business feddie and typically the fourth quarter and the first quarter are a little bit slower in terms of originations but we think we ll see as we especially as we get into the second quarter and third quarter this year we ll see some increases in mortgage revenue i mean rates are still really low and we ve got a lot of people out there working hard on it refi activity is staying fairly good but in our markets we re really more dependent on purchase money type mortgages with an economy that sees a lot of new homes being built and sold feddie strickland janney montgomery scott analyst gotcha thank you guys so much for answering my questions have a great day devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer sure absolutely you too operator there are no further questions in queue at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to mr devan ard for any additional or closing remarks devan ard chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator i don t have any additional remarks i just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today and i hope you have a good weekend operator

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures

water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and

blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be

round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the

after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university

we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was

of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal

blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of

pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a

that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

last year republican senator josh hawley of missouri stirred up controversy during a speech at the national conservatism conference that claimed the american middle class had been betrayed by an out of touch cosmopolitan elite that catered to the needs of multinational companies while forgetting the heartland given brexit donald trump s election and a global turn to nationalism more generally hawley s comments were anything but exceptional what made them unique was that he directed his ire at particular academics for promulgating the beliefs of what he called the cosmopolitan consensus perhaps the best known of these was the famed university of chicago philosopher martha nussbaum whom hawley attacked for teaching her students that world citizenship trumps being the citizen of a nation state those wondering how nussbaum might respond to hawley s criticism didn t have long to wait by coincidence a little over a month later harvard university press published her most recent book the cosmopolitan tradition a noble but flawed ideal in it nussbaum spends most of her time discussing the limits of cosmopolitanism while developing her own positive account of the nation state and its responsibilities cosmopolitanism the idea that we are first and foremost citizens of the world rather than of a particular nation or region is predicated on a universal respect for human dignity and a demand for justice regardless of race sex or creed nussbaum argues however that to arrive at this conception of human dignity the cosmopolitans of earlier ages came to exclude worldly success or material wealth from their notions of the dignified life in order to treat people as having a dignity that life s accidents cannot erode nussbaum explains the founders of cosmopolitanism at money rank and power saying that they are unnecessary for human flourishing the dignity of moral capacity is complete in itself for nussbaum the crux of the problem with cosmopolitanism is to be found here it imposes no duties of material aid since a dignified life can be achieved without goods or fortune this also suggests that the pursuit of justice doesn t require material expenditure which nussbaum views as clearly false hence the tradition s major flaw it holds that material possessions make no difference to the exercise of our capacities for choice and other aspects of our dignity nussbaum offers instead her capabilities approach a template for constitution making that secures citizens the freedoms and opportunities necessary for human flourishing as a way of providing political solutions to these problems she thus sees the nation state as offering the most feasible means for ending the bifurcation between dignity and material aid by guaranteeing some reasonable level of economic and social rights but what does that mean for cosmopolitanism what obligations do nation states have to one another according to her perspective for enforcing agreements on shared standards of justice and might not such enforced standards all too easily be used as a weapon to dragoon recalcitrant nations into obedience as nussbaum puts it popular swipe left below to view more

thinking about the cosmopolitan tradition has evolved over the years and how the capabilities approach should be understood in the light of a younger generation s interest in socialism as well as the political right s growing hostility to cosmopolitanism daniel steinmetz jenkins daniel steinmetz jenkins in a nutshell what defines the cosmopolitan tradition martha nussbaum it is defined by the belief that we are first and foremost citizens of the entire world kosmou politai not citizens of a particular nation or region and that our first duty should be to the whole world rather than to our co nationals or our families or other groups dsj you haven t always thought of this tradition as flawed what changed your mind mn actually i always thought that cosmopolitanism had one large flaw namely its focus on duties of justice instead of duties of material aid exponents of cosmopolitanism have argued that duties of justice are strict and exceptionless while duties of material aid only need to apply to the near and dear since the best cosmopolitan account of the duties of justice cicero s argues that they are not simply negative but that they require us also to prevent aggression against our allies these duties of justice are very demanding and fulfilling them costs a lot of money more very likely than feeding all the world s hungry so that is one problem with the bifurcation of duties an internal inconsistency that is found in the cosmopolitan tradition another problem is that hunger and poverty disfigure and insult human dignity just as surely as war does dsj and how does this fit into your book s argument mn initially the narrative of my book traced the gradual realization within the tradition of the importance of material aid a history in which hugo grotius and adam smith make major steps forward but over the years i have come to see other flaws in the tradition first it is a comprehensive ethical doctrine telling us what to prefer in every situation like john rawls i believe that in a pluralistic society we are not entitled to base our political principles on any comprehensive doctrine only on a partial doctrine that we expect that holders of major religious and secular doctrines can over time come to accept so any cosmopolitan ethics must be narrow not covering all domains of human life and metaphysically thin related article jedediah purdy has an idea that could save us from capitalism and the climate crisis aaron bady cosmopolitanism also neglects powerful arguments on behalf of the moral importance of the nation the nation is the largest political unit we know that is a vehicle for its citizens autonomy meaning literally their right to give themselves laws of their own choosing it is where we dwell in terms of our most fundamental legal rights and it is accountable to all of us in a way that larger units so far at least are not i think for this reason cicero gets it right our duties to the whole world allow us a good deal of room to prefer our own nation finally cosmopolitanism is a form of humanist rationalism our duties are to other humans only and their ground is the claim that all humans partake in rationality i reject both the rationalism and the humanism found in this tradition even within our species we should treat as full equals people with severe cognitive disabilities that rationalism does not include but we also have stringent duties to other animals and the world of nature i ll go further all forms of rationalist humanism typically cast aspersions on our animality and teach us to have disdain and disgust for ourselves insofar as we are animals this is a pernicious idea that has done untold damage dsj there is a way of reading your book that suggests the cosmopolitan tradition has become less flawed as it has evolved cicero and the stoics for the most part believed that the dignified life involved our capacity to live a moral life regardless of material inequality but as we move through the centuries to the early modern period adam smith and hugo grotius begin to recognize in varying degrees that human dignity must involve certain levels of material aid do you think this is primarily due to the egregious violence of an emerging global capitalist system and the colonial domination to which it gave rise what exactly led to this significant change mn adam smith certainly saw some of the depredations of materialism and he was a vehement critic both of colonial conquest and of the slave trade but he did not think capitalism properly regulated had to have such flaws he believed that law should rein in the excesses of capitalist greed but he also believed that the free movement of capital and labor would be a great leveler bringing a decent life within the reach of many this could not happen however if the monopoly power of companies such as the british east india company was not restrained by law and he favored measures to limit monopoly power and companies influence on the political process so that s one way in which his reflections about capitalism pro and con are connected to his new emphasis on material aid another source for smith s thinking about material aid lay closer to home a scotsman who lived for long stretches in england smith observed the difference between working class children in scotland who were given a free compulsory public education and those in england who were shunted directly into factories with no education and he concluded that the human capabilities of the latter were being mutilated and deformed the state he concludes has a duty to provide all its citizens with some especially essential human opportunities later thinkers such as t h green developed this idea into comprehensive political support for free compulsory primary and secondary education as for grotius he wrote before the rise of capitalism and his thinking about material duties was inspired by debates about the freedom of the seas in which he played an active role the whole earth is the common possession of us all and this common ownership limits private domination and also gives all people limited rights over not only the seas but also agricultural produce if they need it to survive dsj what is the connection between the cosmopolitan tradition and your notion of the capabilities approach how does the latter avoid the flaws of the cosmopolitan tradition mn the capabilities approach or what i call ca is a template for constitution making that specifies some extremely important substantial opportunities that a just nation should guarantee to all its citizens up to some reasonable threshold level the level to be set by the nation itself i also think that beyond our borders we ought to help other nations attain such capabilities thresholds in the book i note that this is very hard since i am convinced by nobel prize winning economist angus deaton that most foreign aid is counterproductive my view however is a partial political doctrine like rawls s it thus respects what he called political liberalism it has a big place for nations to choose their own versions of the capabilities and nothing is implemented from without only from within it is not based on rationalism and in frontiers of justice i show how it does justice to the full equality of people with both physical and cognitive disabilities finally it makes room for nonhuman animals and the world of nature as i say in frontiers but will develop more fully in a book currently in progress dsj do you think the global human rights movement today advances your capabilities vision and if not what are the consequences for us when it does not use such a standard mn in some ways it does but for me the implementation of human rights norms ought to be at the national level as today it mostly is anyway treaties mobilize people and are useful in that way but the real site of change is and should be where people have a voice i also think the human rights movement has dealt badly with women s human rights segregating them in a separate document that omits some of the most important things artificial contraception domestic violence the assignment of a monetary value to women s domestic work and in other ways the human rights movement just avoids the material duties issue finally such movements focus on human rights avoiding any commitment to the rights of nonhuman animals which i do not approve of dsj what makes the capabilities approach a kind of cosmopolitanism is that it is not grounded in a comprehensive view of the good life or a religion that is rooted in a locale or doctrine from what i understand it seems to be drawing from rawls and citing the origins for this kind of overlapping consensus in 17th century europe and north america and as a result of the wars of religion mn no in fact i have strongly criticized rawls for his ignorance of non western sources for ideas of rights and similar bases for overlapping consensus my own work has focused on india for many years and in a forthcoming article i ve written the capabilities approach and the history of philosophy i emphasize that its historical roots in philosophy are highly diverse they include the greeks and romans enlightenment liberals and marx but also asian thinkers as well i discuss for example amartya sen s debt to both buddhist and hindu thought and my own debt to the philosophical thought of the indian philosopher rabindranath tagore dsj how might you avoid accusations or criticisms especially coming from postcolonial studies in the wake of 9 11 that this is a kind of liberal imperial project mn well it would surely be odd to call an argument that draws from the ideas of amartya sen part of an imperial project since he is a proud citizen of india and his ideas were formed there before its independence as part of the resistance to the raj specifically in rabindranath tagore s school tagore jawaharlal nehru mohandas gandhi b r ambedkar and nelson mandela are also among my main sources when i teach my course on global inequality i insist on spending two whole seminars out of nine studying india so that my students will understand that india s ideas came from india they were not borrowed from the raj they were invented in bitter opposition to the raj tagore to me is among the world s greatest political thinkers and yet almost nobody in the us and europe reads him the reason i think is just ignorance and obtuseness his philosophical works were written by him in english so they are fully accessible and his literary works which also express his philosophical ideas are now well translated the only part of his legacy that euro americans have a hard time accessing are the more than 2 000 songs in which he expressed his ideas of what a democratic nation ought to be including the songs that later became the national anthems of india and bangladesh tagore also practiced what he preached like john dewey he created a radical school but unlike dewey he also created a university more or less everything i write is inspired by tagore though ambedkar is a close second and at the level of personal affection i feel especially drawn to nehru and mandela i draw attention to their thought not only in my book and articles on india but also in other books of mine there s a chapter on tagore in political emotions saying why he s a better and deeper source for thought about liberal ideals in certain ways than kant mill and comte i also have written extensively about nehru and gandhi and in my recent book on anger i have dared to talk at length about the thought of nelson mandela though i claim no expertise in african philosophy mandela i think is always writing for an international audience always in english i have read virtually everything he wrote including his prison letters i have even visited that prison on robben island dsj let s transition a bit to talk about how the cosmopolitan tradition might relate to contemporary politics earlier this year senator josh hawley of missouri gave a keynote address at the national conservatism conference in which he blamed the cosmopolitan elite of this country for selling out the middle class to multinational corporations in this speech hawley singled out you and three others as being the nation s leading academics of the cosmopolitan elite without citing it explicitly he was quoting from an essay in your 1996 book for love of country in which you encourage students to think of themselves as world citizens rather than as citizens of the united states does your new book which sees the cosmopolitan tradition as noble but flawed allow for something of a compromise with hawley mn that essay was originally published as an op ed in boston review in 1994 hawley quoted me correctly and since he is not a scholar he was not aware that i have changed my views i think that this failure of knowledge on his part is totally fine a politician is not responsible for tracing a scholar s changes of view but many scholars too cite me as if i still held the 1994 view and that i do regard as indefensible since scholars should not cite another scholar on the basis of an op ed in the first place without reading that person s books and then second they should take note of major changes that are clearly announced as such every time that essay is reprinted with my permission i require a prefatory note saying that it no longer expresses my view and referring readers to political emotions but so often people reprint it and reproduce it for classes without permission i have arrived at universities to find whole classes of students studying that article as if it were my current view well ok they might like it better than they like my current view but they should still learn which is which as for hawley of course i was defending transnational moral ideals not the greed of multinationals but i did disparage patriotism he s right about that and i now defend instead a globally sensitive patriotism based on the ideas of the capabilities approach as an essential part of sustaining good ideals i argue in political emotions that even the best ideals go stale and flat if we don t use rhetoric and the arts to sustain the patriotic emotions focused in them and in the monarchy of fear i study how the arts sustain hope in difficult times i see the cosmopolitan tradition as continuous with these books developing a globally and ethically sensitive notion of nationhood and emphasizing a potential alliance between nations and their duties to one another dsj your book spends very little time dealing with the post brexit post trump world and yet it does offer an analysis of what is happening today as you put it we are witnessing a new medievalism one that has taken the form of economic globalization with multinational corporations leaching away sovereignty from the poorer nations as they pursue politics that are not exactly motivated by the moral law what do you mean by a new medievalism and does not the notion of leaching away sovereignty from the poorer nations sound no different than a nationalist battle cry mn the book began in 2000 as a set of lectures and has been rewritten for almost 20 years it was complete in manuscript form in 2016 but it was delayed because harvard didn t want it to appear at the same time as the monarchy of fear so that is one reason why i do not talk about trump and brexit in it but more generally i am a philosopher and as a philosopher i seek a more general and lasting set of principles i am not a political scientist or political commentator that s not what i am good at nor do i think that the world has really retreated from liberal ideals saying that is an academic fad i believe how could lamentable events actually show the failure of an ideal they could show this only if it were shown that these ideals are bad goals or that they are utterly incompatible with human nature and i don t see that today s world shows either of these things most ideals are not fully realized do norms and laws against theft fail because there is still a lot of theft people don t say that and yet what they re saying about liberal ideas seems to me very similar the world never fully implemented those liberal ideals because power prevented it but that would hardly show that the ideals are not worthwhile any more than the enduring existence of racism would show that the ideals of martin luther king jr were mistaken and the success of the global human rights movement and especially the progress in women s human rights shows that liberal ideals still inspire and are worth clinging to the phrase new medievalism was used by the international relations scholar hedley bull and i use the term in a passage discussing his ideas i think he is underappreciated in part because of his premature death so i like to make people aware of him what he meant by the phrase was that we now realize that the world contains not just nation states but other entities with which we must reckon my own account includes in this list ngos corporations and international agencies as for leaching away sovereignty i think you might have misread the passage or i must have written it unclearly i was talking about the phenomenon in which a poor nation nation a wishes to provide a certain level of labor support for the working poor and a certain level of environmental protection for all but then a rich nation comes along and says we d like to set up our factory in your nation but right now we can t afford those protections so either weaken them please or we ll go away to nation b which is prepared to play ball with us here the us based corporation rather in the manner of a colonial power is trying to dictate to the people of nation a so my view is that this is unacceptable is that a nationalist battle cry on my part not on behalf of the united states which i am insisting is trying to extend its national power illicitly like a colonial power perhaps it is a kind of battle cry on behalf of the people of nation a whose democratic choices are being squashed and i do believe that nation a has the right to choose its own constitution and its own set of standards and rights but the reality in our world is that a few nations take that power away from many other smaller nations dsj the world right now is experiencing a right wing nationalist turn given this climate some might find the kind of global liberal capabilities approach you re advocating outmoded can you tell us why you think it is not mn i don t think that there is any single right wing trend today i think people are too myopically focused on the us and europe the world is larger than that and each nation is different india s current murderous right wing regime began its rise in the 1920s inspired by german fascism if it s only recently that people in the us know about the hindu right that is because they don t study india in school modi won two elections in part because of his vicious hindu first politics but far more because the opposition was corrupt and ridiculous and because the us and europe basically gave him a free pass out of ignorance and obtuseness dsj what is the relationship between a capabilities approach and socialism or something like the green new deal especially since both seem to avoid the bifurcation between the moral and material well being for which you find fault in the cosmopolitan tradition is not socialism what the capabilities approach needs or would it be disqualified for being a comprehensive doctrine mn socialism is a word used today more for its emotional resonance than for a precise meaning some use it in its original meaning including state ownership of the means of production along with virtually everyone today i reject that idea as an economic idea that has failed some use socialism to mean egalitarianism i am in favor of a democracy with an ample social safety net in which there is still room for people to use discretionary after tax income to do whatever they like so it is like most european social democracies in that sense egalitarian up to a point but with some room for differences over that ample threshold no nation offers a pure egalitarianism for good reasons incentives but also personal freedom however i think that specific economic decisions about the best shape of a health care system or a university system are properly contextual and historical and many different specific policies can be defended as good ones for a particular country in health care i favor universal coverage but i think the us would be well advised to get to that incrementally without eliminating private insurance more like france than like norway i also think that our mixture of public and private universities has proven a good system in terms of flexibility and quality enabling us to avoid the crippling cuts to the humanities and arts that threaten most european nations it just is not healthy for academic policy to be made by elected officials who know little about research and for whom cost cutting seems a passport to reelection as for the green new deal i agree with david weisbach and eric posner s excellent book climate change justice that environmental concerns should not be considered as a thing apart but should be pondered as part of an overall consideration of national welfare and global welfare we have to figure out what we can do i like bold idealistic proposals as a first step but at the end of the day the budget is multifaceted and finite my capabilities approach is a multifaceted account of basic welfare that holds 10 separate goals in balance with one another that i think is the right approach i would also like to add that one thing i believe in to the bottom of my heart is that we should elect more scientists to the us congress much of our policy is made by people who are ignorant of scientific fact or who even believe nonfacts i applaud the efforts of 314 action and its associated pac to achieve this goal climate change is urgent and we need legislators who know the science and can rebut stupidity
abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and

them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the

countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures

water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___

in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news

after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers

abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt ___ abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and

abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age ___ blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 ___ trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ___ ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email ___ impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted ___ trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released ___ trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front ___ sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it ___ black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing ___ air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days ___ economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest ___ trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited ___ trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton ___ household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office ___ associated press writers
