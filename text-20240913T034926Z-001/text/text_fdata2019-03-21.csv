economic and monetary developments overview based on a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook the governing council took a series of monetary policy decisions at its monetary policy meeting on 7 march the weakening in economic data points to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that will extend into the current year even though there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are starting to fade the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets appears to be leaving marks on economic sentiment moreover underlying inflation continues to be muted the weaker economic momentum is slowing the adjustment of inflation towards the governing council s aim at the same time supportive financing conditions favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures against this background the governing council decided to adjust its forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates to indicate its expectation that they will remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term as well as to reiterate its forward guidance on reinvestments furthermore the governing council decided to launch a new series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii and to continue conducting all lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in march 2021 these decisions were taken to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term economic and monetary assessment at the time of the governing council meeting of 7 march 2019 global growth momentum continued to moderate in late 2018 global growth is projected to decelerate in 2019 but to stabilise over the medium term the slowdown has been more pronounced in the manufacturing sector with global trade decelerating sharply as a result heightened global uncertainties relating to trade disputes the financial stress in emerging market economies last summer and signs of weaker growth in china have contributed to the slowdown in global growth and trade while those headwinds are expected to continue to weigh on the global economy this year recent economic policy measures are expected to provide some support global trade is expected to weaken more significantly this year and to grow in line with activity in the medium term global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained while downside risks to global activity have been accumulating long term risk free rates have declined since the governing council s meeting in december 2018 in the context of a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and a perceived slowing of the pace of monetary tightening in the united states the prices of euro area risk assets such as equities and corporate bonds have recovered amid improved risk sentiment fuelled in part by greater optimism regarding global trade negotiations in foreign exchange markets the euro has broadly weakened in trade weighted terms euro area real gdp growth remained subdued in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 0 2 quarter on quarter incoming information suggests that growth will continue at moderate rates in the near term data releases have continued to be weak in particular in the manufacturing sector reflecting the slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector specific factors the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer lasting which suggests that the near term growth outlook will be weaker than previously anticipated looking ahead the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions further employment gains and rising wages and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity this assessment is broadly reflected in the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1 1 in 2019 1 6 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised down substantially in 2019 and slightly in 2020 the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are still tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 1 5 in february 2019 from 1 4 in january on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to remain at around current levels before declining towards the end of year measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted but labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth this assessment is also broadly reflected in the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1 2 in 2019 1 5 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised down across the projection horizon reflecting in particular the more subdued near term growth outlook annual hicp inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 1 2 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 money growth and credit dynamics moderated in january 2019 but bank funding and lending conditions remained favourable broad money m3 growth decreased to 3 8 in january 2019 from 4 1 in december 2018 m3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation notwithstanding a recent moderation in credit dynamics the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations declined to 3 3 in january 2019 from 3 9 in december 2018 reflecting a base effect but also in some countries the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic activity while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 3 2 borrowing conditions for firms and households are still favourable as the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 continue to support access to financing in particular for small and medium sized enterprises the governing council s decisions in particular the new series of tltros will help to ensure that bank lending conditions remain favourable going forward the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to have been broadly neutral in 2018 but is projected to be mildly expansionary from 2019 onwards this is mainly the result of a loosening fiscal stance in a less favourable macroeconomic environment monetary policy decisions based on the regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council made the following decisions first the key ecb interest rates were kept unchanged the governing council now expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term second the governing council intends to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation third the governing council decided to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years these new operations will help to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy under tltro iii counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30 of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 february 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations over the life of each operation like the outstanding tltro ii programme tltro iii will feature built in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable further details on the precise terms of tltro iii will be communicated in due course fourth the governing council decided to conduct the eurosystem s lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in march 2021 the governing council took these decisions to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term the decisions will support the further build up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term in any event the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards its aim in a sustained manner external environment global growth momentum continued to moderate in late 2018 and surveys suggest that it has weakened further in early 2019 the slowdown has been more pronounced in the manufacturing sector with global trade decelerating sharply as a result heightened global uncertainties relating to the trade dispute between the united states and china the financial stress that was seen in emerging market economies last summer and more recently signs of weaker growth in china have all contributed to the slowdown in global growth and trade while those headwinds are expected to continue to weigh on the global economy this year recent economic policy measures are expected to provide some support as a result global growth is projected to decrease in 2019 but to stabilise over the medium term global trade is expected to weaken more significantly this year and to grow in line with activity in the medium term global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained while downside risks to global activity have been accumulating global economic activity and trade global growth momentum moderated further in late 2018 economic activity in advanced economies weakened in the fourth quarter of 2018 with growth slowing in both the united states and the united kingdom while growth in japan strengthened in that quarter this followed a contraction in the previous quarter on account of a series of natural disasters growth in emerging market economies emes also weakened in late 2018 including in china survey based evidence suggests that growth has continued to weaken in early 2019 the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi excluding the euro area has continued to decline owing mainly to weakening global manufacturing activity service sector activity has also moderated recently although its decline has been weaker and from a higher level see chart 1 global manufacturing activity has slowed against the backdrop of maturing business cycles in key advanced economies at the same time the pace of this slowdown has been accentuated by heightened uncertainties weighing on the global economy such as the lingering trade dispute between the united states and china the financial stress that was seen in emes last summer and more recently signs of weaker growth in china the slowdown in global manufacturing activity is also weighing on global trade chart 1 global composite output pmi diffusion indices sources markit and ecb calculations notes the latest observations are for february 2019 long term average refers to the period from january 1999 to january 2019 financial conditions in advanced economies remain accommodative overall while the picture for emes remains mixed market expectations of further interest rate increases in the united states have eased amid a further decline in treasury yields partly reflecting developments in term premia in china financial conditions have also eased as policymakers have adopted a looser monetary policy stance in response to indications of weakening activity following a sharp decline at the end of 2018 against the backdrop of renewed concerns about the global economy global stock prices have rebounded since the turn of the year however global risk sentiment has not yet fully recovered and volatility in financial markets remains elevated in some of the emes that were hardest hit by the financial market turbulence last summer including argentina and turkey financial conditions remain relatively tight and are continuing to weigh on activity global growth is projected to soften this year amid increasing headwinds these include weaker global manufacturing activity and trade in an environment of high and rising political and policy uncertainty the sizeable procyclical fiscal stimulus in the united states which includes tax cuts and increased spending is continuing to help drive us and global growth but the partial federal government shutdown which ended in late january is expected to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2019 in china domestic demand is expected to weaken in the first half of this year as the impact of recently implemented policies is likely to kick in with something of a lag looking further ahead global growth is projected to stabilise over the medium term three key forces look set to shape the global economy over the projection horizon first cyclical momentum is expected to slow in key advanced economies as capacity constraints become increasingly restrictive and policy support gradually diminishes amid positive output gaps and low unemployment rates second china is expected to continue its orderly transition to a weaker growth path that is less dependent on investment and exports and finally growth is forecast to recover in several key emes which are currently going through or have recently experienced deep recessions overall the pace of global expansion is expected to settle at rates below those seen prior to the 2007 08 financial crisis turning to developments in individual countries activity in the united states has remained relatively robust the country s strong labour market favourable financial conditions and fiscal stimulus are continuing to support growth outweighing the adverse impact of the trade dispute with china the negative impact of the partial federal government shutdown is expected to be temporary annual headline consumer price inflation fell to 1 6 in january from 1 9 in the previous month largely on account of falling energy prices while consumer price inflation excluding food and energy remained unchanged at 2 2 in japan recovering domestic demand supported growth in late 2018 this recovery followed a sharp contraction in the third quarter on account of a series of natural disasters looking ahead the country s accommodative monetary policy stance its strong labour market and its robust demand for investment despite a weakening external environment are all projected to support growth in addition fiscal measures are expected to smooth out the negative impact of the consumption tax increase that is scheduled for october of this year the fact that wage growth remains modest despite a very tight labour market and inflation expectations are at low levels suggests that inflation will remain below the bank of japan s 2 target over the medium term in the united kingdom heightened political uncertainty is continuing to weigh on growth even the short term outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty as a result of the forthcoming votes on the eu withdrawal agreement in parliament over the medium term growth is expected to remain below its pre referendum trajectory in central and eastern european countries growth is projected to moderate somewhat this year investment growth remains strong supported by eu funds and consumer spending also remains robust underpinned by strong labour market performance however the slowdown in the euro area is weighing on the growth outlook for this region over the medium term growth levels in these countries are expected to fall back towards potential growth in china has lost some of its momentum in recent months moreover monthly indicators suggest that this trend is likely to continue in early 2019 in order to shield the economy from a sharper slowdown the chinese authorities have announced a number of fiscal and monetary policy measures which are expected to deliver a smooth deceleration in activity this year looking further ahead progress with the implementation of structural reforms is projected to result in an orderly transition to a more moderate growth path that is less dependent on investment and exports economic activity in large commodity exporting countries is projected to gradually strengthen the outlook for growth in russia is shaped by developments in global oil markets and past declines in oil prices are projected to weigh on activity this year looking further ahead economic activity in russia is expected to gradually strengthen amid constraints imposed by international sanctions and uncertainty relating to the implementation of structural reforms and spending commitments announced last year growth in brazil is also projected to strengthen supported by accommodative financial conditions and declining political uncertainty in turkey economic activity contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2018 as a result of the legacy of last summer s financial turmoil high inflation and procyclical monetary and fiscal policies following a strong adjustment in late 2018 growth is projected to resume later this year and gradually rise thereafter global trade growth moderated last year amid significant volatility with a strong performance being recorded in the first half of 2018 followed by a relatively sharp deceleration that slowdown reflects weakening global manufacturing activity heightened trade tensions and more recently a significant deterioration in trade in asia particularly in china according to cpb data the volume of global merchandise imports fell by 1 2 in december in three month on three month terms signalling a further weakening of global trade momentum in the fourth quarter of 2018 see chart 2 moreover incoming data indicate that global trade growth has remained weak in the first quarter of 2019 a temporary truce agreed between the united states and china in december 2018 put a further escalation of trade tensions on hold tariffs on usd 200 billion of chinese exports to the united states had originally been set to rise from 10 to 25 as of 1 january 2019 but that increase was put on hold as a result of the agreed truce while this sent a positive signal there remains considerable uncertainty as to whether the ongoing trade negotiations will lead to a significant de escalation of trade tensions meanwhile president trump has recently announced that the truce is to be extended citing progress achieved in those trade negotiations which means that the increase in tariff rates remains on hold a formal trade agreement between the united states and china is currently expected to be signed in late march risks remain however as trade tensions could intensify again and the us administration could impose new tariffs on imports from other countries chart 2 surveys and global trade in goods left hand scale three month on three month percentage changes right hand scale diffusion indices sources markit cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis and ecb calculations note the latest observations relate to february 2019 for the pmis and december 2018 for global merchandise imports following a robust performance last year global economic growth is projected to weaken this year before stabilising over the medium term according to the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections global real gdp growth excluding the euro area is projected to fall to 3 5 this year down from 3 7 in 2018 this reflects increasing headwinds to global growth such as weaker global manufacturing activity in an environment of high and rising political and policy uncertainty over the period 2020 21 it is then projected to stabilise at around 3 6 as a result of a slowdown in key advanced economies china s transition to a weaker growth path and an expected pick up in growth in several key emes as a result of global growth headwinds weighing significantly on global trade growth in euro area foreign demand is projected to slow significantly this year falling to 2 2 down from 4 0 in 2018 in the medium term euro area foreign demand is expected to grow in line with activity as the impact of the heightened political and policy uncertainty is expected to gradually dissipate compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections global gdp growth has been revised slightly downwards for this year meanwhile growth in euro area foreign demand has been revised significantly downwards for this year and slightly downwards for next year these revisions reflect disappointing data releases in late 2018 coupled with projected declines in demand for imports in china and the rest of emerging asia as well as in european economies outside the euro area downside risks to global activity have been accumulating despite the temporary truce between the united states and china tail risks stemming from an intensification of global trade tensions remain high a sharper slowdown in china s economy might be more difficult to address using policy stimulus which will also pose challenges in the context of the country s ongoing rebalancing process meanwhile a no deal brexit scenario could have highly adverse spillover effects especially in europe and elevated geopolitical uncertainties could weigh on global growth finally some emes remain vulnerable to the reversal of capital flows though the risk of significant numbers of emes suffering acute stress has recently subsided global price developments oil prices have remained highly volatile in the final quarter of 2018 oil prices declined amid assurances by saudi arabia and russia that they would offset the effect on oil supply of the us sanctions against iran that downward pressure then intensified with the us government granting temporary waivers for key importers of iranian oil and us crude oil production standing at a high level amid renewed concerns about the global economy oil prices then recovered somewhat at the turn of the year as the opec agreement to cut production took effect amid unexpectedly high levels of compliance by the various member countries looking ahead oil prices are expected to remain broadly stable at this lower trajectory over the projection horizon consequently the oil price assumptions underpinning the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections were around 8 6 lower for this year and 8 2 and 8 0 lower for 2020 and 2021 respectively relative to assumptions underpinning the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections since the cut off date for

organisation for economic co operation and development oecd annual headline consumer price inflation averaged 2 4 in december 2018 down from 2 7 in the previous month owing to a decline in the contribution of the energy component see chart 3 underlying inflation excluding food and energy was also down slightly on the previous month standing at 2 2 tight labour market conditions across major advanced economies have so far translated into moderate wage increases and the pace of underlying inflation remains subdued past declines in oil prices are expected to weigh on headline inflation

looking ahead global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained growth in the export prices of the euro area s competitors is expected to weaken sharply this year and remain steady over the medium term this reflects a declining positive contribution from the oil price which is projected to turn negative in the near term and will thus outweigh the upward pressures on underlying inflation stemming from diminishing spare capacity at the global level financial developments since the governing council s meeting in december 2018 global long term risk free rates have declined in the context of a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and a perceived slowing of the pace of monetary tightening in the united states the prices of euro area risk assets such as equities and corporate bonds have recovered amid improved risk sentiment fuelled in part by a greater sense of optimism regarding global trade negotiations in foreign exchange markets the euro has broadly weakened

following communications from the federal reserve system which were interpreted by the markets as signalling a slower intended pace of monetary policy tightening in addition to possible spillovers from the united states euro area bond yields also reflected a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook following a number of worse than expected macroeconomic data releases as well as some

sector incoming data suggest that growth will continue at moderate rates in the near term looking ahead the expansion of the euro area economy is expected to continue supported by favourable financing conditions further employment gains and rising wages as well as the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area expect annual real gdp to increase by 1 1 in 2019 1 6 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised downwards substantially for 2019 and slightly for 2020 growth in the euro area continued at a slow pace in the fourth quarter of 2018 while weak growth mainly reflected a contraction in the industrial sector it remained resilient overall real gdp increased by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of last year slightly above the rate in the previous quarter see chart 10 subdued growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a sharp contraction in the industrial sector while services continued to exhibit stronger dynamics domestic demand and net trade made positive contributions to growth increasing by 0 4 and 0 2 respectively while changes in inventories had a dampening effect decreasing by 0 4 overall output growth in the fourth quarter led to a yearly rise in gdp of 1 8 in

quarter on quarter see chart 11 most euro area countries saw an increase in employment which was broadly based across sectors currently the level of employment stands close to 3 0 above the pre crisis peak recorded in the first quarter of 2008 taking into account the latest increase there has been cumulative growth in employment in the euro area with 10 million more persons in employment than at the time of the trough in the second quarter of 2013 continued employment growth combined with a drop in gdp growth in 2018 has led to a moderation in productivity growth following a modest pick up in 2017 empirically adjustments in employment tend to lag behind declines in output one reason is that longer term employment contracts cannot be adjusted immediately when firms face a slowdown in demand recent short term labour market indicators continue to point to positive but moderating employment growth in the first quarter of 2019 the euro area unemployment rate stood at 7 8 in january 2019 unchanged from december 2018 and remains at its lowest level since october 2008 survey indicators point to a further slowdown in employment growth in the first quarter of 2019 chart 11 euro area

purchasing managers index pmi is expressed as a deviation from 50 divided by 10 the latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2018 for employment february 2019 for the pmi and january 2019 for the unemployment rate private consumption growth edged up in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is expected to regain further momentum in the quarters ahead as temporary dampening effects wane in an environment of continued strengthening of households labour income private consumption increased by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 following somewhat weaker growth in the third quarter the weakness in household expenditure partly reflected temporary bottlenecks in the car sector affecting the consumption of durable goods and the negative effect of energy price increases on household purchasing power the crude oil price in euro increased from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018 which negatively affected consumption growth in particular of non durable goods i e food and energy subsequently the oil price declined sharply before recovering somewhat in the last two months this should support consumption of non durable goods in the near term furthermore employment growth strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2018 in an environment of robust wage increases this implies steady growth in households real disposable income and supports consumer confidence and spending in addition while financing conditions remain very favourable households net worth improved at a strong rate in the third quarter of 2018 latest indicators also suggest some strengthening of private consumption momentum in the course of the year ahead recent data on retail sales and car registrations indicate moderate but steady growth in consumer spending the volume of retail sales increased by 1 4 in january 2019 following a drop in the previous month as a result sales stood at 1 5 above their average level in the fourth quarter of 2018 the indicator for new passenger car registrations posted its fourth consecutive increase in january 2019 rising by 4 8 on a monthly basis this confirms previous expectations for a normalisation in car registrations following the volatile developments triggered by the introduction of the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp on 1 september 2018 in addition consumer confidence increased for a second consecutive month in february halting the declining trend observed throughout most of 2018 the latest improvement reflects households more benign views regarding their past and future financial situation as well as the expected general economic situation and unemployment consumer confidence remains above its historical average level and is consistent with ongoing steady growth in private consumption the ongoing recovery in housing markets is also expected to continue albeit at a slower pace than in 2018 housing investment increased by 0 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting the ongoing recovery in many euro area countries and in the euro area as a whole although growth over 2018 was slower than the buoyant growth experienced in 2017 it remains at solid healthy levels in line with these developments recent short term indicators and survey results point to positive but slowing momentum construction production in the buildings segment increased by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 recovering from 0 8 in the third quarter the european commission s construction confidence indicators for the past few months point to positive albeit weakening momentum in the fourth quarter of 2018 and early 2019 the purchasing managers index pmi for housing activity averaged 52 0 in the last quarter of 2018 but decreased to 50 6 in january 2019 however both the pmi indicators and the european commission s confidence indicators remain clearly above their long run averages business investment in the euro area appears to have lost some momentum in the second half of 2018 but fundamentals remain supportive available country data for some of the larger euro area countries point overall to a slowdown in business investment growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 the slowdown in business investment partly reflects heightened policy uncertainty and financial volatility in some euro area countries persistent concerns about global trade developments the possibility of a no deal brexit and economic weaknesses in china also appear to have adversely affected business confidence the assessment of export order books and production expectations in the capital goods sector continued to worsen in january and february 2019 however fundamentals remain supportive of business investment first capacity utilisation remains well above its long term average and a large share of manufacturing firms report lack of equipment as a factor limiting production second the ecb s monetary policy measures continue to support favourable financing conditions and access to financing for euro area firms third during the recent period of recovery firms have also used profits to build up a sizeable liquidity overhang euro area trade in goods continued to grow at a subdued pace at the end of 2018 and is expected to decline further in the near term according to the latest release of data from the national accounts in the last quarter of 2018 total euro area exports increased by 0 9 while imports increased by 0 5 on a quarterly basis incoming data on the monthly trade in goods confirm a poor performance by total euro area trade in the fourth quarter mostly driven by intra euro area trade in december 2018 nominal euro area exports contracted by 0 5 month on month with intra euro area exports decreasing even more by 0 9 nominal euro area imports saw a slight month on month increase of 0 4 temporary factors such as the new regulations on vehicle emissions tests have weighed on exports however a generalised decrease can be observed across all product categories the united kingdom turkey and china continue to drive the weakness in extra euro area exports observed in the last few months of 2018 looking ahead leading indicators point to a further reduction in extra euro area exports in the coming months in february 2019 the manufacturing pmi for new export orders outside of the euro area was at its lowest since november 2012 46 4 and the european commission s assessment went more negative compared with january the latest survey results have continued to disappoint and suggest that euro area growth is moderating in the short term the european commission s economic sentiment indicator remained broadly unchanged in february standing above its long term average so far in 2019 the average stands at 106 2 below the 108 9 average for the last quarter of 2018 although the indicator declined for the industry and construction sectors this was broadly offset by positive sentiment in services the retail sector and households the composite output pmi increased slightly in february but the average for the first two months of the first quarter of 2019 stood below that for the previous quarter 51 4 compared with 52 3 despite the

industrial goods inflation remained unchanged at 0 3 other measures of underlying inflation including the persistent and common component of inflation indicator pcci and the supercore indicator which are only available for the period to january also pointed to a continuation of the broad sideways movement of recent months see chart 14 nonetheless each of the statistical and model based measures

the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see chart 18 this pattern reflects a sharp decline in hicp energy inflation in 2019 which is mainly accounted for by the strong drop in oil

oil price futures curve hicp inflation excluding energy and food will be on a gradual upward path supported by the more gradual but continued economic recovery and the tightening labour market

account of methodological changes money and credit money growth and credit dynamics moderated in january 2019 broad money growth has shown strong resilience in the face of the phasing out of monthly net purchases under the asset purchase programme app at the same time bank funding and lending conditions remained favourable net issuance of debt securities by nfcs declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2018 against the background of a continuing gradual deterioration in bond market conditions that started in late 2017 broad money growth moderated in january with rates continuing to hover around the level observed since march 2018 the annual growth rate of m3 decreased to 3 8 in january 2019 from 4 1 in december 2018 see chart 19 this development shows the resilience of m3 growth in the face of the declining mechanical contribution of app purchases m3 growth has eased since late 2017 coinciding with the phasing out of net asset purchases this in turn implies that the app had a smaller positive impact on m3 growth the narrow money aggregate m1 which includes the most liquid components of m3 continued to make a large contribution to broad money growth despite declining to 6 2 in january money growth continued to receive support from sustained economic expansion and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid instruments in an environment of very low interest rates chart 19 m3 m1 and loans to the private sector annual percentage changes adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects source ecb notes loans are adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling the latest observation is for january 2019 overnight deposits remained the main contributor to m3 growth the annual growth rate of overnight deposits decreased to 6 4 in january reflecting the moderation in the annual growth of overnight deposits held by nfcs while the expansion of overnight deposits held by households remained stable moreover steady growth in currency in circulation speaks against any large scale substitution of cash for deposits in an environment of very low or negative interest rates for the euro area as a whole short term deposits other than overnight deposits i e m2 minus m1 continued to make a negative contribution to m3 growth although the spread between the interest rates on short term time deposits and overnight deposits has stabilised since late 2017 marketable instruments i e m3 minus m2 which are currently growing at a slow pace given the low remuneration of these instruments had a neutral overall impact on m3 growth credit to the private sector remained the largest driver of broad money growth from a counterpart perspective see chart 20 in the context of the aforementioned phasing out of monthly net purchases under the app the positive contribution to m3 growth from general government securities held by the eurosystem decreased further see the red parts of the bars in chart 20 this has been largely offset by a moderate increase in the contribution from credit to the private sector since late 2017 see the blue parts of the bars in chart 20 while private credit remained the main source of money creation the decline in the contribution of the app has recently been replaced by external monetary flows see the yellow parts of the bars in chart 20 and credit to the general government see the light green parts of the bars in chart 20 the increasing contribution from net external assets in part reflects investors preferences for euro area assets in the context of a greater aversion to risk linked to higher uncertainty

sales securitisation and notional cash pooling declined to 3 0 in january from 3 4 in december see chart 19 this was owing to a strong decline in the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs to 3 3 in january from 3 9 in december loan growth for firms which was accompanied by considerable heterogeneity across countries matches historical patterns and can be explained by the slowdown in real gdp since early 2018 see chart 21 at the same time the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 3 2 in january also in a context of pronounced cross country heterogeneity see chart 22 lending to the private sector continued to be supported by favourable financing conditions robust growth in business investment improvements in labour markets mature housing markets and growth in both

historical standards in january the composite cost of debt financing for euro area banks remained stable after having progressively increased since the beginning of 2018 see chart 23 this development reflected unchanged bank bond yields in the euro area as a whole heterogeneity across countries was considerable given that political uncertainty was high and banks access to wholesale funding was uneven at the same time the costs of deposit funding remained unchanged the repercussions of higher costs of funding through the issuance of debt securities on the overall composite cost of funding for banks have been rather limited owing to this type of funding s limited importance in banks funding structures overall therefore bank funding conditions have remained favourable reflecting the ecb s accommodative monetary policy stance and the strengthening of banks balance sheets moreover the new series of tltros will help to ensure that bank lending conditions remain favourable going forward

households fell by around 130 and 110 basis points respectively the reduction in bank lending rates for loans to nfcs as well as for loans to small firms assuming that very small loans of up to 0 25 million are primarily granted to small firms was particularly significant in those euro area countries that were most exposed to the financial crisis this indicates a more uniform transmission of

estimated to have stabilised in the fourth quarter of 2018 bank lending growth was solid supported by still favourable credit standards and a further decline in the relative cost of bank lending by contrast net issuance of securities was negative over the quarter reflecting the moderation of economic growth lower values of mergers and acquisitions as well as increases in the cost of market based financing and uncertainty along with other factors these developments are however becoming increasingly heterogeneous across countries in the fourth quarter of 2018 the net issuance of debt securities by nfcs was significantly negative amidst a continuing increase in the cost of debt issuance during that time the weakness in net issuance activity in the last quarter of 2018 can be partly attributed to the seasonal pattern of the series but from a more medium term perspective the annual net issuance flows for december 2018 reached the lowest reading since may 2016 see chart 26 and remain in line with the declining trend that started at the beginning of 2017 market data suggest that the net issuance of debt securities by investment grade issuers increased in the first months of 2019 while it remained virtually zero in the high yield segment the net issuance of listed shares was basically zero in the fourth quarter of 2018 chart 26 net issuance of debt securities and quoted shares by euro area nfcs annual flows in eur billions source ecb notes monthly figures based on a 12 month rolling period the latest observation is for december 2018 in december 2018 the cost of financing for nfcs edged up further in december the overall nominal cost of external financing for nfcs comprising bank lending debt issuance in the market and equity finance stood at 4 8 up from 4 7 in november the current cost of external financing surpasses the historical low of august 2016 by 57 basis points but remains substantially lower than the level seen in mid 2014 when market expectations regarding the introduction of the public sector purchase programme began to emerge fiscal developments a mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity at the same time countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers all countries should continue to increase efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances likewise the transparent and consistent implementation of the european union s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy following an improvement last year the euro area general government budget deficit is projected to deteriorate in 2019 and remain broadly stable in the following two years based on data for 2018 that are still incomplete the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is estimated to have stood at 0 5 of gdp compared with 1 0 of gdp in 2017 the fall in 2018 was mainly the result of favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest payments the improvement is likely to be reversed this year on account of a significantly lower cyclically adjusted primary balance the higher deficit is also expected to persist over the next two years see chart 27 the outlook for the euro area general government deficit for the next two years has deteriorated compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the higher deficit is partly the outcome of a lower primary balance reflecting policies that are more expansionary than previously expected in several of the largest euro area countries it is also the result of a lower cyclical component given that the macroeconomic outlook has been revised downwards chart 27 budget balance and its components percentage of gdp sources ecb and march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections notes the data refer to the aggregate general government sector of the euro area the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to have been broadly neutral in 2018 but is projected to be mildly expansionary from 2019 onwards this profile is mainly driven by cuts to direct taxes and social security contributions in both germany and france but it is also a result of relatively dynamic expenditure growth in several countries the decline in the euro area aggregate public debt to gdp ratio is projected to continue at a slower pace according to the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the aggregate general government debt to gdp ratio in the euro area is expected to decline from 86 8 of gdp in 2017 to 81 1 of gdp in 2021 the projected reduction in government debt is supported by both the negative interest rate growth rate differential and continued primary surpluses see chart 28 although deficit debt adjustments are expected to offset some of these effects over the projection horizon the debt ratio is projected to fall or increase only slowly in all euro area countries but will continue to far exceed the reference value of 60 of gdp in a number of countries compared with the december 2018 projections the decline in the aggregate euro area debt to gdp ratio is expected to be more subdued over the whole horizon this is mainly due to the increasing interest growth differential in 2019 reflecting the downward revision of gdp growth as well as lower primary balances chart 28 drivers of change in public debt percentage points of gdp sources ecb and march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections notes the data refer to the aggregate general government sector of the euro area countries need to continue their fiscal policies in full compliance with the stability and growth pact this may include allowing automatic stabilisers to operate where appropriate at the same time countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers all countries should continue to increase efforts to

mariarosaria comunale ramon gomez salvador and lucia quaglietti this box looks at the current phase of the business cycle in major non euro area advanced economies with a view to assessing the factors behind the transition to weaker growth although growth in non euro area advanced economies has been slowing signals of a severe slowdown or recession appear contained at the current juncture and our baseline scenario remains one of a modest economic deceleration liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 31 october 2018 to 29 january 2019 prepared by toshi nakamura and

its asset purchase programme app with a target of 15 billion of net purchases on average per month until the end of december 2018 it then entered the reinvestment phase on 1 january 2019 employment growth and gdp in the euro area prepared by vasco botelho and antónio dias da silva this box analyses developments in the euro area labour market with respect to recent changes in gdp growth the labour market remained relatively robust throughout 2018 in spite of the slowdown in real gdp growth a decomposition of gdp into labour productivity labour market outcomes and demographic trends shows a larger contribution to real gdp growth from employment see chart a in the first three quarters of 2018 economic growth was strongly supported by employment growth and by the stable decline in the unemployment rate these developments contrast sharply with trends during the early period of the recovery and highlight the strength of the labour market in the euro area against the background of the slowdown in gdp growth in 2018 indeed despite the considerable heterogeneity observed across different euro area countries the aggregate euro area unemployment rate was in december 2018 at its lowest since october 2008 with the employment to population ratio higher than in 2008 new features in the harmonised index of consumer prices analytical groups scanner data and web scraping prepared by martin eiglsperger harmonised indices of consumer prices hicps for food industrial goods services and energy are measures that the ecb uses for its more detailed analysis of inflation in the euro area with the release of the hicps for january 2019 these analytical groups special aggregates are based on a more exact allocation of products as a result the distinction between goods and services and between unprocessed and processed food is now more precise this improvement has been achieved by deriving special aggregates from the hicp s generic classification the european classification of individual consumption according to purpose ecoicop which provides a more detailed level of breakdown than the product classification used thus far another recent enhancement is the extended use of supermarket scanner data web scraping an automated approach to collecting mass data from websites is also being more broadly applied overall these changes reflect better the actual consumer price developments in the economy especially since they increase the coverage of sales prices a new method for the package holiday price index in germany and its impact on hicp inflation rates prepared by martin eiglsperger harmonised indices of consumer prices hicps are regularly updated for changes in consumption weights and the items included and on occasion also for methodological improvements one such improvement is a change in the way the price index for package holidays is calculated in the hicp for germany which was implemented with the hicp release for january 2019 this has led to revisions of annual rates of change not only for germany but also for the euro area as a whole interest rate growth differential and government debt dynamics prepared by cristina checherita westphal the difference between the average interest rate that governments pay on their debt and the nominal growth rate of the economy is a key variable for debt dynamics and sovereign sustainability analysis the change in government debt between two years equals the interest paid on the stock of debt the primary deficit excess of expenditure excluding interest payments over revenue and other factors deficit debt adjustments for ratios to gdp the change in debt is then mainly determined by the primary balance and the difference between the interest rate and the gdp growth rate if the interest rate growth differential is strictly positive a primary fiscal surplus is needed to stabilise or reduce the debt to gdp ratio the higher the initial debt level the higher the primary surplus will need to be conversely a persistently negative on government debt would imply that debt ratios could be reduced even in the presence of primary budget deficits lower than the debt effect induced by the differential the european commission s 2019 assessment of macroeconomic imbalances and progress on reforms prepared by nick ligthart on 27 february 2019 the european commission published its annual assessment of macroeconomic imbalances and the progress made with structural reforms based on the country specific recommendations csrs as adopted in july 2018 this assessment is a key part of the european semester framework for coordinating economic and fiscal policies across the eu within this context the macroeconomic imbalance procedure mip provides a framework for assessing macroeconomic imbalances it aims to prevent the emergence of harmful imbalances and to actively correct imbalances where they have already become excessive article taking stock of the eurosystem s asset purchase programme after the end of net asset purchases prepared by felix hammermann kieran leonard stefano nardelli and julian von landesberger following the governing council s decision in december 2018 to end net asset purchases under the eurosystem s asset purchase programme app this article reviews the implementation and effects of the asset purchases the app has proved to be an adaptable and effective instrument to ease monetary and financial conditions foster economic recovery counteract disinflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations thereby supporting a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards price stability the app has been part of a package of policy measures together with negative interest rates on the deposit facility forward guidance and targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros jointly creating synergies that have enhanced the effectiveness of each of the package s individual components from an implementation viewpoint the eurosystem ensured that asset purchases were conducted smoothly and flexibly by striving for market neutrality and mitigating unintended side effects for market functioning whereas net asset purchases have come to an end principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app will continue to be reinvested as this together with enhanced forward guidance provides the monetary accommodation that the governing council judges to be required for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term statistics

meeting 10yr us treasury yields dropped sharply moving down to around 2 52 having been around 2 63 earlier on this week accordingly the us dollar also fell against most of its peers with eur usd moving above 1 14 thought the move against the pound has been more limited analyst view kathy lien managing director of fx strategy bk asset management advertisement the us dollar sold off sharply against all of the major currencies after the federal reserve s dot plot forecast revealed that 11 out of 15 us policy makers no longer believe that a rate hike is necessary this year going into the fomc rate decision investors and economists expected their forecast to drop from 2 rate hikes this year to 1 but it fell to zero a dramatic change that reflects the severity of the fed s concerns according to the monetary policy statement some of the main problems include muted inflation slower household spending and business investment while the central bank feels that the labor market is strong and job gains are solid the deeper than expected slowdown and decline in inflation allows them to keep monetary policy accommodative for the rest of the year fed chair powell confirmed that the us economy is in a good place and set to grow solidly in 2019 but trade talks brexit european tariffs twin deficits and weaker global growth pose risks to growth until some of these uncertainties are lifted powell feels that it s a great time for the fed to be patient to watch and wait although the fed chair laced part of his speech with optimism it was overshadowed by their lower interest rate gdp and inflation forecasts we expect the dollar to fall further with usd jpy which has closed below the 20 day sma for the first time since january extending its slide to 110 the euro and the pound

higher nominal pay increases and lower inflation however high economic uncertainty may lead to a rise in precautionary savings for the public finances following january s record monthly surplus which was supported by strong income tax receipts we expect the february data to also show an improvement over last year while no move is expected the accompanying statement might create some volatility in

exchange rate gbp usd was able to recover most of its losses on wednesday it was not thanks to gbp strength despite cpi coming in above forecast at 1 9 sterling was plunging after the eu s tusk pushed back against an extension for the uk if they did not have an agreed upon deal to enact analyst view marshall gittler acls global meanwhile back in brexitland pm may wrote to ec president tusk seeking a delay of brexit until 30 june but tusk apparently has said the eu would only guarantee an extension if parliament approves the deal that they ve negotiated and that parliament has turned down twice already and isn t allowed to vote on again one wag commented on twitter that pm may was trying to find more road but still doesn t have a can to kick down it hence the plunge in gbp the problem is that an extension of that length would require britain to participate in the european parliament elections that begin on 23 may only to see the country leave the eu shortly thereafter the other eu countries don t want this and are getting fed up the ft quoted one senior eu diplomat working on brexit as saying this is a circus that is beyond comprehension while another said it s like dealing with a failed state there s a growing sense that britain should just get out of the eu as soon as possible tusk s statement may make it more likely that parliament does pass the bill by putting more pressure on dissenters it s either that or get trapped in brexit purgatory but that of course depends on the government being allowed to submit it again next week which is far from certain in fact i don t even understand how that can be on the table any more after the speaker ruled it out this week if she can t resubmit it then i don t know what s going to happen nobody wants britain to crash out without an agreement but i don t see any willingness to give them an extension just to debate it endlessly either probably failure to pass the bill next week would result in a general election an even more fragmented parliament and more chaos i remain firmly negative on gbp while the inflation reading was snubbed it may yet help to support gbp if the bank of england are encouraged by it in combination with rising wages and low unemployment analysts at lloyds noted their belief that sticky inflation continues to support a hawkish view for the pound against a backdrop of relatively soft productivity growth and accelerating wage growth rising unit labour costs should ensure that underlying inflation remains sticky for some time to come assuming that the bank of england s view of a brexit deal being struck holds this would support our belief that modest increases in bank rate are likely to be required over the forecast horizon markets have long assumed that the eu would just blankly agree to any extension proposed by the uk but this does not appear to be the case as fed chair powell indicated he was concerned over brexit during his press conference markets will continue to be attuned to developments for now a plunging us dollar may be gbp usd s best bet of staying above 1 30 as the brexit deadline races towards us latest exchange rates 21 03 2019
the united states ranks no 1 among the world s 50 largest economies in the strength of its protection of intellectual property ip the u s chamber of commerce s international ip index states the report ranks economies based on 40 indicators that benchmark activity in patent trademark copyright and trade secrets protection critical to innovation the 50 economies represent a geographical cross section of the world and the vast majority of global economic output contributing more than 90 percent of global gross domestic product ip intensive industries supported at least 45 million u s jobs and contributed more than 6 trillion to u s gross domestic product 38 2 percent of the nation s total economic output in 2016 says the u s department of commerce benchmark ip protection the report highlights the improvements in ip protection in the u s mexico canada agreement usmca signed by president trump in 2018 and pending approval by congress which the study states could set a new global ip standard the usmca s ip related provisions are a significant improvement over the north american free trade agreement nafta and other international agreements specifically related to ip says the report released on february 8 specifically usmca includes stronger pharmaceutical related ip protection including regulatory data protection for five years for new chemical entities and 10 years for biologics it also includes more effective trade secret protection including criminal sanctions and border enforcement against all suspected counterfeit goods including in transit goods usmca also includes some strengthened copyright provisions such as a longer term of protection and digital rights management drm and other technological protection measures we re waiting for congress the usmca must be approved by both houses of congress and some want to kill the deal says economist stephen moore a senior fellow with the heritage foundation and an economic advisor to the trump presidential campaign all these democrats who were sounding like free trade zealots when trump was talking about tariffs now that they have a chance to actually vote on a free trade agreement they don t want to do it said moore i really want to get this thing signed sealed and delivered and we re waiting for congress to act moore said china challenge ip challenges at the heart of the current trade dispute between china and the united states highlight the importance of ip to the two largest economies in the world the report states the trade dispute brought much needed attention to longstanding issues that create significant challenges for ip intensive industries globally since the mid 2000s china has introduced and implemented a range of policies making access to the chinese market conditional on the sharing of technology and ip with domestic entities these policies include the transfer of proprietary technologies in procurement joint ventures and standardization processes local manufacturing requirements and limitations on investment by foreign entities businesses have no guarantee their ip will be protected from unauthorized disclosure duplication distribution and use although some of these policies have been revoked many are still in place and china continues to introduce more of them china has made meaningful changes to its legal code and enforcement efforts have improved although they still face a daunting challenge the report states in key areas relating to technology transfer licensing and localization requirements chinese policy remains more or less wedded to its desire to exploit ip developed elsewhere half trillion dollar theft losses due to the theft of u s ip by chinese companies amount to hundreds of billions of dollars says edward hudgins research director for the heartland institute which publishes budget tax news theft of american intellectual property is one of most serious problems in our economic relationship with china said hudgins the loss to american companies is at least 200 billion and could be over a half trillion dollars a significant amount of the technological innovation china claims to have developed has been stolen from the united states says hudgins the federal reserve bank of minneapolis suggests over half of china s technology was acquired from foreign firms which would include much stolen from american companies said hudgins those companies often are required to partner with chinese firms and share technology contrary to world trade organization rules as the price of access china s market legal remedies sparse china s legal system provides little recourse for u s firms says hudgins placing american labels on counterfeiting products is a regular practice but legal remedies for american companies in china are among the worst in the world said hudgins just as low priced labor is one of china s economic advantages the intellectual property created by american firms is one of this country s great strengths said hudgins the united states needs to negotiate a trade deal that protects americans intellectual property rights china is a big problem the challenges of ip protection in china highlighted in the report are a major subject in the ongoing u s trade negotiations with china says moore i think china is a big problem said moore i think we re in an abusive relationship with china it s got to stop they have to start playing by the rules they have to stop cheating and stealing trump is trying to level the playing field and i think this is critically important to our economic future that we prevail here moore said i want them to start behaving themselves and make some concessions that are all very fair minded if that happens i think the economy is really going to boom joe

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available the most common types of available security interests that can be granted under vietnamese law are the pledge of property and mortgage of property the civil code 2015 also provides for security by way of performance bond security deposit escrow deposit title retention guarantees reputation based collateral and lien on assets of particular note types of security generally available in other common law jurisdictions such as assignment by way of security and fixed or floating charges are not recognised under vietnamese law as a general rule security can be taken over a property whether movable or immovable existing or to be formed in the future provided that such property must meet the following conditions it is under the legal ownership of the securing party except in the case of retaining property or reserving ownership rights it must be identifiable and it is not subject to prohibited transactions collateral may include movable property land use rights and assets attached to land including plants buildings equipment and machinery receivables shares securities onshore and offshore bank accounts contractual rights proceeds from investments and the sale of collateral in respect of property to be formed in the future collateral may include after acquired property but it excludes land use rights in respect of operating or other licence rights or concessions in highly regulated industries the enforcement of security created over such rights is uncertain given that those rights are granted specifically to certain eligible investors and the transfer of such licence rights is subject to strict conditions for example the transferee of a mining exploration licence must satisfy all the conditions for the grant of mineral exploration licences under the law on minerals as a practical matter senior lenders typically accept taking a mortgage over equity interests of the project company contractual rights to income streams due under project documents and other project assets rather than the licence itself collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security in general a security agreement must be in writing depending on the type of secured property such as land use rights forest use rights and ownership rights of planted production forests aircraft or seagoing vessel other cases provided by law mandatory registration of security may apply a security interest in principle will take effect as from the time of execution by the parties subject to certain exceptions however such security interest should be registered to be enforceable against a third party s competing claims as from the date of completion of security registration registered secured transactions will have priority in terms of payment over any unregistered secured transactions the priority of payment to creditors is established according to the order of registration principle there is a nominal registration fee applicable to the registration of a secured transaction foreign lenders may engage a credit institution licensed to operate in vietnam to act as an onshore security agent to hold the collateral for and on behalf of them though the regulatory framework on appointment of onshore security agent is not well developed currently land use rights generally cannot be mortgaged in favour of a foreign lender land and assets attached to land may be mortgaged to a credit institution licensed to operate in vietnam subject to certain conditions the parallel debt clause concept is not recognised in vietnam assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien the inspection of property registration records can be sought from the following state agencies depending upon the type of collateral with respect to immovable property a local land use registration office is in charge of land registration where a land area as collateral is located besides that evidence of any existing mortgage is generally recorded in the relevant land use right certificate and with respect to other types of property a creditor may search existing security interests against the property through the national registry of secured transactions portal under the ministry of justice enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral a project lender as a secured party will enforce its rights over the collateral in accordance with the methods agreed in a security agreement which may include sale of secured assets collection and receipt of the collateral in the satisfaction of performance of the obligation by the securing party collection of money due or other receivables from a third party in the case of the mortgage of a right to reclaim a debt and other arrangements agreed by the parties to the secured transaction if no agreement is reached on the enforcement method of a security interest the collateral must be disposed of by way of an auction in the case that secured assets are land use rights and assets attached to land that are registered with the land use registration office the realisation of secured assets must also be notified to such agency when a single item of property is used as security for performance of multiple civil obligations prior to the realisation of such property the realisation must be notified in writing to other secured parties enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement as soon as a vietnamese court accepts an insolvency petition the enforcement of a security interest over the collateral by a project lender will be temporarily suspended until the bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by the court except for the case where the security interest is likely to be damaged or dramatically devalued where the enforcement of such assets may be immediately made at a court order the bankruptcy proceedings apply to all entities excluding to the extent of any contrary provision provided by an international agreement to which vietnam is a signatory there is a preference period of six months or 18 months if it is a related transaction prior to the date on which a vietnamese court decides to commence bankruptcy proceedings against an insolvent entity where certain transactions will be deemed void foreign exchange

is made in the laws of the countries that entered into mutual legal assistance treaties with vietnam or on a reciprocal basis vietnam is not a party to the international centre for settlement of investment disputes vietnam joined the new york convention 1958 with a reservation that vietnam will only recognise and enforce foreign arbitral awards in disputes that have commercial characteristics pursuant to vietnamese law under vietnamese law there are three categories of commercial dispute that can be resolved by arbitration disputes arising from commercial activities disputes in which at least one party is engaged in commercial activities and 0ther disputes in which the law stipulates that arbitration is a permissible means of resolution under vietnamese law not all disputes can be

and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards may be made on basis of the principle of reciprocity law governing agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs project agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs financing agreements which matters are governed by domestic law english law is typically selected by the parties for financing documents including facility agreements and intercreditor agreements and certain government guaranteed project documents including the concession agreement and the supply and off take agreements however the governing law of a land lease agreement and onshore security agreements is vietnamese law the choice of a foreign law may not be recognised if the consequence of its application is contrary to the fundamental principles of vietnamese law the concept of fundamental principles of vietnamese law has not been clearly defined so vietnamese courts have broad powers to interpret this concept on a case by case basis submission to foreign jurisdiction is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable the law on investment 2014 clearly renders disputes between foreign investors or project companies and government authority arbitrable and such disputes can be referred to international arbitration or arbitration in other jurisdictions with reference to the recognition and enforceability of foreign arbitral awards see question 22 the civil code 2015 provides that waiver of immunity is effective when an international agreement to which vietnam is a signatory has regulations on waiving immunity an agreement on waiving immunity is concluded by the parties in such civil relation and vietnam or the central or local government agency waives the immunity although the civil code 2015 for the first time sets out circumstances under which a waiver of sovereign immunity by the state of vietnam or a vietnam government agency is effective the question of enforceability of such waiver as to the concept of sovereign immunity remains largely untested environmental health and safety laws applicable regulations what laws or regulations apply to

leaving tariffs on china for a long period of time that is even if a trade agreement is reached the tariffs won t be limited until china complies with the terms of the deal his comments come just ahead of ustr lighthizer s trip to beijing next week to resume the negotiation he said we re not talking about removing them we re talking about leaving them for a substantial period of time because we have to make sure that if we do the deal with china that china lives by the deal trump also criticized that china had a lot of problems living by certain deals china has yet to have a formal response to the comments yet but what trump said were generally seen as counter productive to the negotiation as well as the world economy without us stopping the punitive tariffs china will certainly not agree to correcting its unfair trade practice while lifting its own retaliatory tariffs at the same time the us won t have it all that is even if there is an eventual agreement and china will speed up it s reforms tariffs from both sides will stay there for much longer as we emphasized before there is no trade truce for now no ceasefire the tariffs are the cannons of trade war and they are bombing both economies everyday right now they re hurting the world too and will continue to do so for a long period of time as trump indicated eu would grant short brexit delay only if commons approve the deal uk prime minister theresa may formally wrote a letter to european council president donald tusk yesterday seeking for article 50 extension until june 30 the date itself is debatable already as eu insisted it couldn t be later than may 23 when eu elections are held the issue right now is that eu has given quite unified response that uk could be granted an extension only on condition that the brexit deal is approved by the commons in statement tusk offered to give short article 50 extension but that would be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the house of commons if his proposal is approved by all other 27 eu members and there is a positive vote in the house of commons next week the eu can finalize and formalize the decision on extension in the written procedure tusk is ready to call for another eu summit next week if needed this position is rather unified in the eu as officials repeated emphasized that there much be a purpose for the extension be it until may 23 or june 30 but then the question remains on whether may could secure enough support for her deal it remains a developing story may said at her downing street residence that the brexit delay is a matter of great personal regret she added i passionately hope that mps will find a way to back the deal i have negotiated with the eu a deal that delivers on the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable and i will continue to work night and day to secure the support for the deal though she emphasized she s not preferred t delay brexit any further than june 30

china seeks to avoid fate of japan in us trade war deal as heavyweight economists gather in beijing a group of heavyweight chinese economists sat down with japanese counterparts in beijing on tuesday to discuss whether china can avoid its own lost decades as the government looks to negotiate a deal to end the us china trade war japan engaged in a lengthy trade dispute with the united states in the 1980s with a series of deals over currency and market access blamed in some quarters for the decades of economic stagnation that followed it is known that many in beijing are worried that a bad trade deal with the us could result in china following a similar trajectory with currency exchange rate and market access high on the list of demands of washington s negotiators in particular us demands that china limit the yuan s depreciation have been compared with the plaza accord under which japan france germany the united kingdom and the us agreed to push the value of the us dollar down against the japanese yen and german deutsche mark at a symposium on tuesday hua sheng a chinese economist and honorary dean of the economics school at southeast university in nanjing said he was eager to hear from japanese experts over how the plaza accord had changed the japanese economy it s a big warning for the chinese people hua said japan is china s neighbour and japan s path has significant referential value for us through the plaza accord the five countries began selling large amounts of us dollars leading to a significant loss in dollar value the intervention resulted in the japanese yen doubling in value against the us dollar in under two and a half years japan s exports became more expensive and less competitive as a result arguably defanging the engine of its 1980s economy as china and the us reach enter the final stages of negotiations over a deal that could end the trade war the parallels are clear for many in china a widely held perception among chinese scholars is that the plaza accord helped to fuel japan s asset bubbles in the following years which led to decades of economic stagnation and wrecked japan s chances of catching up with the us economy indeed former japanese deputy vice minister for finance masahiro kawai said last month that he is in regular touch with chinese officials and economists on this topic while details of the us china deal have not been disclosed speculation in china is rife that the us is pushing for a new plaza accord and this has faced some resistance in official circles taoran notes a social media outlet controlled by beijing said that the deal between beijing and washington is unlikely to enable the us to pressure on china for appreciation of yuan the symposium was sponsored by the sasakawa japan china friendship fund and supported by the chinese people s association for friendship with foreign countries a beijing affiliated organisation now chaired by li xiaolin daughter of former chinese president li xiannian at the event xu xiaonian a professor of economics at the china europe international business school said that the us china trade dispute has broader geopolitical and ideological context than the japan us dispute because the us is seeing a challenger for its global leadership this time around it is utterly important for china to reach a deal with the us through negotiation xu said it can send a message that china will continue its opening up policy it can show people that trade disputes can be settled by making compromises and it can relieve the nervousness in the us about china s rise xu said that the real lesson china must learn from japan is about domestic reform namely liberalising its economy to give businesses more freedom jia kang a former researcher with china s ministry of finance and president of the china academy of new supply side economics told the event that the us demand for greater market access and structural economic reforms could promote positive domestic change in china an escalated trade dispute is forcing china to open its market wider and to take a new stance jia said a bad thing can be turned into a good thing but not all speakers saw the same potential dangers for china s economy in japan s history chi hung kwan a senior fellow at the nomura institute of capital markets said it was wrong to see the plaza accord as the source of japan s decades of deflation instead he blamed tokyo s slowness in allowing the yen to appreciate for flooding the market with liquidity and creating bubbles in the stock market one lessons for china is that a stable exchange rate does not warrant a stable economy kwan said sometimes you have to let the exchange rate move source south china morning post

the recovery that emerging markets have managed to build throughout the first quarter of 2019 is set to extend further after the downbeat tone that was presented by the federal reserve after its latest monetary policy meeting interest rate expectations in the united states will be significantly downgraded after the comments made by jerome powell in which the fed chair strongly indicated that interest rates will remain on hold for some time and that it ultimately appears that the federal reserve will extend its narrative around the need for patience over the coming months pushed back us interest rate expectations will be enough to fuel some unwinding of dollar positions from a greenback that remains at historically high levels and the immediate reaction will be that this benefits the likes of the euro and japanese yen weakness in the dollar will also prove supportive to gold but where i see the real opportunities for investors are in emerging markets this includes both emerging market stocks and emerging market currencies returning capital into emerging markets will also be a headline that catches further steam moving forward returning investor capital and inflows into emerging markets is a trend that will increase in popularity throughout the developing world and across different continents this will stretch across the likes of china south africa and saudi arabia we should also not discount the momentum that emerging market currencies should be able to build when we consider that many of the currencies belonging to the developing world remain significantly weaker than where they were valued in the time before the fed started monetary tightening four years ago i am looking at the prospects of a stronger indonesian rupiah chinese yuan and malaysian ringgit as a result of the dovish fed message the singapore dollar will also be encouraged by a softer greenback while the south korean won will be watched after it has lagged behind its asian counterparts so far in 2019 when it comes to the african continent i would look for a momentum shift in the south african rand as a result of reversed interest rate optimism in the united states what will be concerning investors behind their trading desks is that it can t be denied that there is a coordinated downbeat view that is being presented by central banks and senior officials across the globe this year the fed has certainly now joined this party by issuing its own need for patience and that global headwinds remain a threat that needs to be closely watched

it has been a year since the murder of david dragičević a student from banja luka which shook the republic of srpska to its core dejan prodanović a member of banja luka s branch of the marxist organisation reds explores the causes for and the dynamics behind the justice for david movement which rattled the reactionary regime of milorad dodik this article apart from giving a detailed description of the protests and the actions of certain figures within it also gives an insight into the class character of dodik s rule read the original at workers portal milorad dodik s rule over the republic of srpska one of the two main entities of bosnia and herzegovina is one of the longest lasting regimes in the yugoslav area after the civil war dodik and his alliance of independent social democrats snsd with a few coalition partners such as the democratic people s alliance dns and the socialist party of rs have had a firm grip on power ever since 2006 during that period candidates from the snsd held positions as serbian members of the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina in the elections of october of 2018 milorad dodik became the serbian member of the presidency he can be compared to montenegro s milo đukanović in terms of the length of his rule over the republic of srpska and his personification of all of the entity s institutions the class basis of dodik s rule in the late 1990s and early 2000s the international community had confidence in dodik since he was a counterpoint to the nationalist policies of the leadership of karadžić s serbian democratic party sds dodik even invited ratko mladić and radovan karadžić to voluntarily surrender to the international court of justice and stop holding the serbian people hostage some 10 years later after his rise to power he presented himself as a defender and admirer of the prisoners in the hague and he even named a students dormitory in pale after radovan karadžić his change from a pro western liberal politician to a so called defender of the bosnian serbs from the imaginary threat of bosniaks shows that dodik is merely an opportunistic oligarchical politician who is in politics only to defend his selfish interests and those of his bourgeois circle dodik s rhetoric is often pointed against nato and the meddling of western imperialism in the national affairs of bosnia and herzegovina which makes a certain number of people in the republic of srpska support his patriotic regime they even glorify him as a decent fighter against western imperialism however despite his occasional grumbling and threats of holding a referendum in reality dodik and his snsd regime go no further than insisting that the dayton peace treaty is upheld a treaty that stands for the occupation of bosnia and herzegovina under imperialistic authority of the eu and nato states while the economic policies of his regime are a long way from genuine anti imperialism imperialist foreign capital in the rs never had an easier job of draining local resources and subsidies and exploiting our workers in the pro war plunder of state property in the rs 716 companies were privatised according to data from the alliance of labour unions of rs 67 percent of those companies ceased to exist those that did not vanish or end up in the hands of tycoons and war profiteers were seized by foreign capital in the early 2000s all the praise for foreign investors whose money and knowledge was supposed to fix our economy turned out to be a sham most of the time there were no serious investments foreign capital was drawn in by generous state subsidies a lack of taxes and most importantly cheap and non unionised labour ruling politicians even boasted about the economic advantage of cheap labour and highlighted it during their election campaigns those in power never cared much about the working conditions in factories owned by foreign companies the important thing was to take photographs at opening ceremonies and after cameras were turned off the workers were abandoned to merciless exploitation one example is the textile factory dubikoton which is under italian ownership dodik s rhetoric is often pointed against nato and the meddling of western imperialism but he depends heavily on foreign capital and has historically been its loyal servant image public domain alongside the sections of industry owned by foreign capital the regime is very servile when it comes to the exploitation of natural resources forests are being cleared with abandon and private sawmills export intermediate goods and firewood primarily to italy and austria in the latest act of plunder the government gave away 64 percent of shares in ljubija iron mine and plans to sell them to an israeli company one of whose shareholders is ari livne an advisor of dodik s furthermore the banking sector is in the hands of italian and austrian banks in the last few years dodik has played the card of russophilia an essential component of serbian nationalism however below the thin veneer of love between orthodox brothers hides the economic interests of dodik s family since his son igor is the owner of a trading company that distributes fruit to russia on the other hand the oil industry in the rs is owned by nyeftegazinkor from russia which owns 1 6 million convertible marks in corporate taxes according to the tax administration in late 2018 the government signed a contract with a chinese company that is supposed to build the banja luka prijedor highway and get a 30 year lease while the government agreed to compensate the chinese investors with 32 5 million marks from road tolls or from the state budget if the road tolls are not enough there is no doubt that this will happen since all the infrastructural projects as well as this one are carried out without conducting feasibility studies dodik s nationalism like any other nationalism is a tool used by the ruling class to divert attention from the social confrontation between itself and the working class of course dodik is helped by bosniak and croatian bourgeois elites in sparking national intolerance as well as by parts of the so called civil opposition primarily the social democratic party of bosnia and herzegovina and the democratic front both of which use the card of integral bosnian nationalism such a party line only fuels the nationalist hysteria of the regime in the rs this enables dodik to constantly flaunt potential referendums if the dayton peace treaty is not upheld and while dodik and the snsd allegedly defend national interests with their nationalist demagogy in reality they use every chance they get to turn against the workers and aid domestic and foreign capitalists the ruling coalition always carried out and voted for anti worker policies in unity with the tycoon parties from the federation of bosnia and herzegovina the other main political entity implementing measures that hurt workers rights or make already poor living conditions even worse was never a problem for the defenders of national interests an example of this is carrying out the reform agenda at the level of bosnia and herzegovina as a whole in fact it was a set of austerity measures dictated by the imf and the world bank that aimed to cut public spending reduce social benefits liberalise the market and change the labour law in the interest of the capitalists in order to increase economic investments between 2015 and 2018 in late 2015 the government adopted a new labour law which amongst other things reduced the compensation for past labour from a coefficient of 0 5 to 0 3 furthermore probation periods were increased from one to two years the law on strikes was also changed rendering strikes meaningless according to the law the government appoints representative unions and the bosses decide on the minimum workflow which enables them to set it at 50 percent of the workers as happened in the railway company of the rs negotiations about defining the general collective agreement between the government the association of employers and the alliance of labour unions have been taking place since 2015 the negotiations halted at the question of travel expenses and annual leave attacks on living standards are constant in 2018 excise taxes on oil were increased which made the prices of basic goods increase in 2019 the government announced an increase in the price of electricity and of vat from 17 percent to 19 percent the reason for this is an attempt to fill the holes in the budgets of the state and its entities the increase in prices is not matched by an increase in wages however the average wage in rs is 852 marks around 440 euros and according to the alliance of labour unions the living wage should be around 1 869 km over 900 euros which means that the average wage is only 45 percent of that even official data on the average wage does not paint the real picture since the largest part of the qualified workforce in the industry and retail sectors work for lower wages around 600 km approximately 300 euros the republic of srpska has also struggled with an exodus of young and highly qualified workers in the last few years the alliance of employers often complains about the lack of labourers but they and the government did nothing concrete nor did they try to drastically increase the wages to make young workers stay in the country especially alarming is the fact that even medical workers are leaving the country the average wage of a nurse is a miserable 650 800 km a few days ago there was news of children s cardiologists leaving the clinical centre of banja luka aside from nationalist demagogy dodik s regime bases itself on a clientelistic network of people positioned in the state apparatus and public enterprises he also has complete control over the radio and television networks of the rs which have practically turned into a public media service for the ruling coalition the alternative television from banja luka was recently bought by slobodan stanković an oligarch and it has changed from a medium that presented a balance between the regime and the opposition and which often criticised the government into an adjunct of rtrs it should also be mentioned that the ruling coalition has no real opponents in the opposition bloc which is led by the right wing serbian democratic party and the liberals from the party of democratic progress justice for david the first true challenge to the regime david dragicevic whose murder sparked a social movement that shook the regime image dragičević family it took a long time before we saw protests of sufficient scale to shake the regime indeed in 2012 there were protests under the name the park is ours in banja luka which lasted for months and were directed against the creation of an office building called grand trade owned by mile radišić another oligarch close to the regime the building was finished anyway the activists were fined and radišić fled to serbia to avoid being charged this movement showed that there is a mood for civil resistance against the attacks of the corrupt regime and arrogant tycoons in banja luka the rebellion of tuzla in 2014 did not overflow into the republic of srpska except for a few solidarity meetings the regime s media outlets did their job of fearmongering and dubbed it an alleged attempt to destabilise the rs in 2017 there were a few hunger strikes on the rs railways and the strikers made threats of railway blockades if their demands continued to be ignored this made the regime panic and mostly accept their demands which showed that the government is not so stable and that every act of rebellion by the working class on the streets deepens the anxiety of the ruling elite justice for david was created as a spontaneous civil movement led by the parents of david dragičević a murdered student from banja luka after the young man s disappearance on the night of 17 march 2018 his body was found on 24 march the first police reports and press conferences showed that the ministry of interior is not telling the truth and is trying to hide something at first the ministry and the media insisted that it was a suicide and that david was a drug addict and a thief this behaviour only aggravated the parents and a part of the public which provoked a spontaneous civil gathering on the krajina square on march 26 since that day protests under the name of justice for david stop the unsolved murders have been taking place every day in banja luka they managed to attract a large number of people from different social layers and age groups pensioners workers the petty bourgeoisie and the youth even though these protests were triggered by the death of david dragičević they directed attention to a string of unsolved murders starting with mafia liquidations and traffic accidents that involved oligarchs and politicians for which no one was held accountable furthermore the protests provided a platform to express the discontent and anger of common people about long lasting injustice corruption malfunctioning of the courts poverty and suffering since 26 march 2018 protests under the name of justice for david stop the unsolved murders have been taking place every day in banja luka image fair use the pressure from the masses and daily meetings forced the government to form a research committee in parliament which was supposed to ascertain the facts about the dragičević case its purpose was to identify uncertainties and irregularities in the investigation which meant that two and a half months after the beginning of protests the prosecutors finally started to investigate the murder since this took place in an election year the protests attracted politicians from the opposition who tried to profit from them politically david s father davor dragičević demanded that the protests should be carried out without political symbols even though opposition politicians were among those gathered the opposition s tv station from bijeljinja bn tv held live broadcasts of the massive gatherings on 21 april 7 july and 5 october 2018 the regime reacted to the presence of opposition politicians and their demands by accusing them of using tragedies to score political points while exploiting the parents grief although the opposition was certainly doing this their actions revealed the hypocritical logic of the regime the regime politicians do the exact same thing when they lament the victims of the wars in the 1990s and the second world war at electoral meetings to whip up chauvinism hatred and fear 10 000 people protesting on 5 october 2018 in krajina square image fair use besides david s parents davor dragičević and suzana radanović the core of the movement consists of david s friends and a few of liberal and civil activists in its early stages the spontaneous and confused movement had a legalistic outlook for more than two decades the people have listened to propaganda about liberal democracy and independent institutions about everything a capitalist state can never provide so these protesters are saying you promised us the rule of law now give it to us the rule of law is a liberal illusion the state is not aloof from society and the class system it is an organ of the ruling class that protects its interests the state under capitalism will always protect the interests of the ruling class common citizens workers and peasants will never be equal to tycoons and politicians before the institutions of the bourgeois state this was all exposed by the justice for david movement davor and suzana s speeches railed against the oligarchy and the system especially at the gathering on 5 october 2018 this is a clear manifestation of class instinct meanwhile the regime s machinery has constantly attacked the movement with invented claims that it aims to destroy the government and abolish the institutions of the republic of srpska and that the entire movement is being abused by politicians from the federation and foreign intelligence services with the goal of a coloured revolution and the destruction of the serbian people after the general elections in bosnia and herzegovina in october and the disappointment among liberal layers it seemed as though the movement entered a phase of exhaustion in the meantime it was registered as an ngo which aims to fight for justice over un resolved murders after the elections politicians of the opposition turned to the composition of parliament furthermore soon after the election dodik bribed a part of the opposition and gave them positions in the government this included the prominent liberal dragan čavić and his people s democratic movement party the faction of the serbian democratic party centred around banja luca mayor of doboj obren petrović čavić was one of the fiercest critics of the ruling coalition but then he became part of it and gave his support to dodik after ignoring and discrediting the seemingly waning justice for david movement the regime started with open repression image fair use after ignoring and discrediting the seemingly waning justice for david movement the regime started with open repression the national day of the republic of srpska on 9 january was drawing near which dodik usually takes as an opportunity to show that the rs is a state and that the serbian people in it are happy and free but the gatherings at the square were ruining this image feeling stable after a landslide victory in the election getting rid of the deplorables in the ruling coalition and attracting certain parts of the opposition the regime tried to arrest davor dragičević on 25 december a date deliberately chosen since it is in the holiday season police searched his house looking for weapons which were not found and removed symbols of the movement from the kraijna square the regime tried to justify the repression on the basis of alleged threats to security caused by a gathering of the movement s sympathisers that was held a few days prior to the arrest in front of parliament and as a response to the re election of dragan lukač as minister of police of the rs his reelection was considered a provocation and a continuation of the cover up of david s murder lukač was called out at the krajina square for months and was marked as the main obstacle to the investigation besides that his previous mandate was identified with unresolved mafia confrontations members of the special forces who robbed banks police inspectors accused of smuggling and trading narcotics a streak of unsolved murders attacks on journalists we have to mention the most recent example of an attempted murder of bn tv journalist vladimir kovačević who reported from the krajina square security disruptions in banja luka etc the regime s propaganda which claims that the gatherings in the square are threatening the security is especially hypocritical if we take into account that during nine months of protests there was not a single incident surprisingly the opposite happened the regime s provocateurs repeatedly tried to provoke davor and even threatened to kill him the police repression on the 25 december against peaceful protesters and videos of police brutality against children youth and the elderly caused anger not only in the rs but in the entire region as well as a new wave of protests on one hand the regime repressed the most active members of the movement in the following days while on the other we heard milorad dodik and dragan lukač saying that the prosecutors were too slow in solving david s case dodik even announced that he would join the people if they protested in front of the prosecutor s office the point of these announcements is merely to transfer the blame among the ruling apparatus since everyone can see that dodik s staff controls every pore of the rs s institutions on sunday 30 december a large meeting called by david s father davor took place attended by a few thousand people the estimates vary from 3 000 to 6 000 people at the meeting davor read the demand for the resignations of dragan lukač minister of the interior darko ćulum director of the police željko karan a pathologist and the head of the institute for forensic medicine želimir lepir prosecutor and dalibor vreća prosecutor the meeting then turned into a protest march from the krajina square to the parliament and government of the rs with participants occasionally blocking traffic and chanting justice for david justice for dženan resignation for lukač thieves then the protest spent some time in front of the building of the rtrs chanting the words factory of lies rtrs is seen as belonging to dodik s party and it spreads the most despicable lies and nonsense to present justice for david movement as a conspiracy created by the federation and international community with the goal of tearing down the institutions of the rs after returning to the krajina square the crowd dispersed after approximately 40 minutes but the police forcibly dispersed the remaining 50 people and used this chance to arrest around 10 ringleaders they even arrested bystanders and people who happened to be at the bus station the police claimed that davor dragičević ran away and that he was not arrested the arrests continued in the following days and an mp from the party of democratic progress draško stanivuković was arrested his use of scandals and sensationalism to attract attention can be compared to croatian right wing politician populist and conspiracy theorist ivan pernar it s quite possible that with time he will become an independent politician and follow the path of right wing populism since he gathered around 20 000 votes at the october elections meetings of the justice for david movement were completely outlawed and the police were patrolling the krajina square the new repression was excused by the fact that the organisers carried on with the protest after the allowed time period from 6pm to 8pm and that they were not allowed to hold a march that blocked traffic subsequently a new year s concert in front of the museum of contemporary art was cancelled igor radojičić was very vocal when it came to accusing the protests of ruining the city s image by preventing new year s celebrations from taking place while the aggrieved parents are struggling for justice for their murdered child radojičić is struggling to preserve the image of the city threatened by the images of police repression and police occupation of the krajina square it is interesting to note that radojičić was silent regarding daily meetings of citizens seeking truth and justice meetings of the justice for david movement were completely outlawed following the protests of 30 december 2018 after which and the police were patrolling the krajina square image fair use although the gatherings of the movement justice for david are now formally prohibited and attempts in the main city square have been persistently suppressed by the police the most relentless members of the movement have found a way to gather in public while trying to escape police brutality the members of the movement and followers gathered in the churchyard of the serbian orthodox cathedral of christ the saviour and lit candles the police did not dare to use force on the church s grounds because they were afraid of the message it would send to instigate violence in front of a church well known for its architectural value and importance to many banja lukas inhabitants in that way the silent protests continued to be held daily under the close watch of the police from the very beginning followers of the movement have pointed out the tenacious silence of the dignitaries of the serbian orhodox church about the case of david dragićević the outcry continued because the doors of the church were always locked as always the church chose the side of the regime all illusions in the church taking a stance against the regime have been absolutely shattered when the regime forced the movement to hold their gatherings in silence in front of the serbian orthodox cathedral of christ the saviour they cleared the main city square and used it for the purpose of the parade in honor of the national day of the republic of srpska on 9 january cynically praising the freedom in which its inhabitants supposedly live in the next few months davor dragičević has addressed the public several times by posting videos recorded in unknown locations on social media in his address to followers he strongly condemned the actions of the police to suppress the protests and stated a clear connection of their actions to the ruling politicians in the government of republic of srpska he accused the police of attempting to kill him and announced the continuation of the fight for solving the murder of his son by seeking help from international institutions bearing in mind that david s mother suzana is living with her children in austria people speculated that this is where davor was probably located this was proved to be true four days before the one year anniversary of david s death when an upsetting photograph of davor kissing the coffin containing david s remains circulated the media david remains were exhumed at the request of his parents and transported to vienna davor said i told you a long time ago that i will ask for the exhumation of the remains of my child yes the republic of srpska prosecution s office and the ministry of the interior they are all killers and criminals therefore david has left this world and that country and for me there are no institutions of the republic of srpska these institutions killed my child i hope that he finds eternal peace here when he could not find it in the country of his birth what to do next the justice for david movement showed a high level of determination and courage during the 12 months of its daily struggle this is particularly true for suzana and davor who showed superhuman strength in the struggle against repression provocations and lies of the unjust state apparatus and pro regime media however in the light of violent repression liberal illusions and appeals to the conscience of the state apparatus are a dead end street it seems that the movement is running out of ideas about how to successfully fight back when the regime clamps down this was obvious during the police actions on 30 december when the people tried to defend themselves against shields and batons by throwing flowers at them this definitely did not influence the consciousness of the police officers whose task was to defend the system also calling for interventions from the european union the international community and foreign embassies is problematic on several counts the justice for david movement showed a high level of determination and courage but how to proceed from here there can be no illusions in international institutions image medullaoblongata projekt primarily this appeal for the intervention of foreign actors alienates a large number of people from the movement and is congruent with the propaganda that portrays dodik as a defender of the rs and every display of discontent as an attempt to bring dodik down secondly it is obvious that western imperialism has no major issues with dodik since he has proved himself to be a loyal and efficient servant of foreign capital his occasional excesses with threats of launching a referendum have the objective of throwing dust in people s eyes to prevent them from seeing the plundered wealth of tycoons himself and his family rather than challenging the unity of bosnia and herzegovina every time dodik goes too far in his excesses he is slapped back into his place by the representatives of american diplomacy and is threatened with sanctions from the usa dodik is very aware of how dependent he is on foreign capital and international financial institutions when it comes to buying social peace and stability in the rs thirdly even if an intervention of western imperialism removed dodik from power that would mean nothing for the working class the opposition whose programme does not differ from dodik s in any significant way would come to power that would only be a cosmetic change and it is important to understand that both the social democratic party and the party of democratic progress held power at the levels of the state and entity several times and that they are currently in power at a local level the interests of the imperialists just like those of the local capitalists are diametrically opposed to those of working people david dragičević is a victim of a capitalist system that creates injustice at every step his murder and the subsequent movement arising from it show that what is needed is a fightback on a class basis image fair use it is obvious that these are two sides of the same profiteering coin and simply sought to use the movement to score political points during the elections after the events of 30 december different groups in the opposition threw accusations at each other saying that draško stanivuković tried to talk davor into entering rtrs which would make the regime accuse him of staging a coup this is only speculation and it is most likely that the regime tried to bribe certain people and fracture the movement however the police were not present around the rtsrs s building despite being everywhere else the march took place which could indicate that they pled ignorance and expected the building to be entered in his speech in front of the building davor mentioned multiple times that he could enter it without a problem but that he did not want to do that there is a small group of sds supporters around the movement and it is assumed that they are responsible for bringing boris malagurski to give a short speech which got only a lukewarm response from the mass the presence of serbian nationalists can be potentially harmful for the solidarity between justice for david and justice for dženan and it could possibly alienate a part of people from the federation who support the movement the task of marxists is to support and take part in davor and suzana s fight thus helping them to find out the truth about their son s death also we must try to direct the struggle towards the widest social layers since that is the only way to fight for these goals and against police repression most importantly we must use this occasion to expose the capitalist class and their so called democracy generally the left is very weak in bosnia and herzegovina and still struggles to people over its voice is barely heard in the nationalist and pro market cacophony however movements such as this one the rebellion of tuzla or the strike of the railway workers give us a chance to take an active part and by putting forward concrete propositions get a platform from which our programme can reach a much larger audience during several larger meetings and in their media statements suzana and davor spoke up against tycoons war profiteers and various scum who have been brutalising us for 30 years this class instinct and anti system mood offer an opportunity for the left to present their ideas we must use this to attract new layers of workers into the revolutionary movement the workers of the rs feel all the injustice of the system on their shoulders they can feel the oligarchs exploitation in their workplaces and witness the haughtiness of the rich and their children every day when these messages penetrate into the consciousness of working masses it won t be long before dodik is seen as the political representative of the rich whose government applies austerity measures in healthcare education and welfare in order to make money for foreign and domestic tycoons whose empires have been built on the workers blood david dragičević is a victim of a capitalist system that creates crime poverty and injustice at every step his murder and the subsequent movement arising from it shows that what is needed is a fightback on a class basis a united working class movement would be able to strike decisive blows against the state apparatus and the interests of capital once the working class begins to move decisively on an organised basis nothing can stop it we have already seen small instances of this threats of blocking the railways in 2017 immediately alarmed the government and sent dodik grovelling at the strikers feet and promptly fulfilling their demands similarly the new year s programme cancellation caused dissatisfaction among hoteliers and representatives of the service industry and they probably exerted a certain pressure on the regime to ban the protests other movements have had similar effects the most important thing in order to achieve victory however is to unify these struggles throughout the former yugoslavia that can only be achieved by the creation of a worker s party with a revolutionary programme of radical social change in the interests of the working majority

photos and additional reporting by ted wood the story group i t s a familiar story a rich country develops oil fields in a heavily indebted nation with lax environmental regulations local residents object claiming that oil and gas extraction degrades their air water and quality of life protests mount as the foreign energy company steamrolls the permitting process locals appeal to elected officials who are powerless to intervene the rich country tries to influence local elections in the foreign country complaints about spills and leaks pour in lawsuits fly there are rumblings that civil disobedience may erupt if the foreign developers continue marching through the countryside this scene has been repeated around the world in nigeria ecuador indonesia and elsewhere in what economists call the resource curse countries with minerals or oil are exploited by foreign powers and end up with damaged land poisoned waters and sullied air in a new twist to an old tale however the foreign developer in this case is canada and the neighbor is the united states specifically boulder county colorado in october 2015 the canada pension plan investment board cppib announced a 900 million deal to purchase all of the oil and gas assets in the denver julesburg d j basin owned by encana at that point one of the largest producers in colorado many of encana s holdings along the front range were located in rapidly growing metropolitan areas north of denver and astride the interstate 25 corridor between colorado s capital and its fourth largest city fort collins on nov 16 2015 the cppib registered crestone peak resources llp with the state of colorado as a foreign limited liability company in delaware and listed its principal address as one queen street east in toronto the purchase deal stalled as financial and social pressures bore down on the oil and gas industry some encana holdings were in places such as broomfield and boulder counties that had banned hydraulic fracturing or fracking in 2012 and 2013 the oil and gas industry challenged those bans and the legal fight reached the colorado supreme court as the encana deal was being negotiated in early 2016 the fracking bans were still in place oil bottomed out at 34 a barrel in february encana s stock had dropped to below 5 from its five year high of more than 24 in the summer of 2014 and many companies in the oil and gas patch were stressed front range citizens groups were organizing ballot measures to force new oil and gas development farther away from where people lived and suburban parents who had never done anything more political than attend pta meetings became fracktivists and planned civil disobedience actions in local libraries then came the colorado supreme court s landmark may 2016 decision that ruling invalidated all local control bans in favor of statewide authority to foster oil and gas development that has historically meant that the state has approved every completed drilling permit application citizens across the front range were outraged after working to get local fracking bans approved by voters why would widows in winnepeg retirees in richibucpo and teachers in toronto choose to invest in colorado s escalating fracking wars the supreme court ruling however was good news for the canadians soon after on aug 11 2016 the cppib announced the purchase from encana a canadian company with a u s subsidiary and created a new company crestone peak resources when the negotiating dust settled the cppib had picked up a chunk of sub surface colorado real estate and wells producing on it for approximately 30 percent less than had been announced just months earlier according to documents filed with the colorado oil and gas conservation commission cogcc crestone became one of the largest companies in colorado focusing on drilling in residential areas of the state s most populous region including more than 100 operating legacy wells in boulder county that pre dated larger scale fracking and horizontal drilling facilities in wide use today the cppib reported paying just 609 million for the encana deal an affiliate of the broe group a denver based company acquired 3 percent of crestone the canada pension plan was moving full steam ahead into a colorado firestorm the cppib is a quasi governmental 368 billion behemoth that invests payroll withholding taxes from canada s workers on behalf of 20 million contributors and beneficiaries and pays benefits much like the u s social security system does its portfolio is vast and includes renewable energy projects real estate business ventures around the world as well as fossil fuel production and pipelines today however institutional investors like the cppib are becoming increasingly aware that new oil and gas development is burdened with with moral legal financial and ecological problems cppib s colorado investment raises a pressing question for people living near crestone s operations as well as for canadian beneficiaries across the country with all the investments in the world available to them why would widows in winnepeg retirees in richibucpo and teachers in toronto choose to invest in colorado s escalating fracking wars toxic assets it may simply be that the cppib was willing to go where other companies wouldn t because the pension board thought it scored a deal from a distressed seller that would yield strong long term results for its beneficiaries the cppib did not respond to multiple phone messages email requests for an interview or a list of emailed questions sent over the course of more than a month despite having an elaborate public relations department just before deadline darryl konynenbelt cppib s director of global media relations wrote in an email cppib declines to comment we refer all questions to crestone see questions sent to cppib at end of article one question was whether the cppib knew it was purchasing what one oil and gas engineer who wishes to remain anonymous for fear his business would be affected by criticizing the industry told me were known as toxic assets by industry insiders oil and gas leases located in controversial territory scattered among housing developments sprouting at nail gun speed in the rapidly growing state in an interview encana spokesman doug hock said the fact that many of the company s colorado assets were located in areas where there was growing resistance to oil and gas development was a factor in the decision to sell to the cppib he emphasized however that it wasn t the main one our d j basin assets certainly had challenges compared to our other assets hock said they were good wells but they didn t fit into our growth strategy pressed on the question about the timing of the sale and the last minute price drop hock wrote in an email i ve been told that there are non disclosure agreements that preclude the parties from discussing those details crestone peak in an email from its public relations department responding said there was nothing unusual about the price dropping from 900 million to 609 million it s very common in acquisitions for the valuation of a company to change from once the acquisition is announced to final closing it stated the company declined to discuss specifics of the sale or current valuation because it is a private company whatever the reasons for the reduced price and encana s motivation to sell the cppib must have known there would be substantial pushback in colorado and in canada several of the cppib s directors as well as several of crestone s board members and executives had worked for encana this includes avik dey a cppib managing director and head of energy and resources who has worked for all three and is currently chairman of the board at crestone peak resources in a cppib press release on oct 8 2015 announcing the deal dey said this investment offers attractive economics and aligns well with our strategy for the energy sector even in canada however fracking is highly controversial the fact that the cppib created a new oil and gas company in colorado rather than simply investing in an existing one added another quizzical twist to the deal i don t think they would ever have invested in a fracking company in canada said john bennett a senior policy advisor to the environmental group friends of the earth canada where three of the country s 10 provinces have banned the practice bennett says that canada s commitment to meeting the paris climate goals is politically popular which requires a concerted global flight from fossil fuels it s a very odd thing for this pension fund to be doing he said most canadians would be surprised to know they own a fracking oil company in colorado denise melanson 70 is one such canadian a retired medical social worker who lives in richibucpo new brunswick melanson receives two pensions from the cpp one that she paid into during her years of employment and the other what she calls an old age benefit that she started receiving when she was 65 when she learned that some of her benefits might be coming from fracking operations in colorado she said in a phone interview i was horrified melanson had been involved in educating her community about the health and environmental impacts from fracking and in passing the moratorium in new brunswick it appalls me that we are doing that to other people instead she said i d much rather not be receiving money that was earned by making other people miserable most coloradans on the other hand would probably be surprised to know that canadian pensioners like melanson are invested in drilling operations in the centennial state s suburban backyards coloradans that do know about the canadian connection are baffled i have to wonder if the beneficiaries of the pension fund s investments understand what they re investing in said boulder county commissioner elise jones she said that as far as she knew virtually every elected official in the county including those from the county s municipalities as well as the overwhelming majority of people who live here oppose the kind of residential drilling plans that crestone has proposed and wish they could halt it concerns range from the planned drilling locations in and around homes schools and boulder county open space holdings to negative health effects from the industrial facilities emissions to the oil and gas industry s impact on the denver metropolitan area s persistently poor air quality to climate change impacts from fossil fuel developments do these pensioners know how much opposition there is to their investment jones wonders if they did they d realize this is not wise or ethical it boggles the mind along with its purchase of these controversial assets crestone also invested in colorado s 2018 election oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the ballot from the governor s race to several ballot initiatives crestone peak contributed 607 500 toward the tens of millions of dollars the industry contributed during colorado s last election cycle to support groups that directly or indirectly opposed proposition 112 the failed setback initiative that would have required new oil and gas development to be placed at least 2 500 feet from homes and schools crestone donated to the pro industry group protect colorado which campaigned to defeat proposition 112 and other political groups supporting republican state legislature candidates that unswervingly support the oil and gas industry 300 000 of those contributions went to a group that supported republican candidates for the state senate which remained in republican control until the last election and had reliably killed any legislation opposed by the energy industry austin graham legal counsel for the non partisan campaign legal center in washington d c reviewed crestone s contributions for their legality with regard to both federal and colorado campaign laws at my request federal law requires that foreign owned companies contributions to state campaigns meet a two part test the contributions must be drawn from money made from u s operations and that the person making the decision to donate is a u s citizen since crestone is a privately held canadian owned company whose only public financial disclosure indicated the company s value has declined since being formed it is not obvious where the money came from or who made the decision to contribute to the election how would you know graham asked crestone stated in an email that it follows all state and federal laws and as a company operating in colorado crestone allocates a certain amount of funds each year to dedicate to organizations and initiatives that are important to our team crestone leadership ultimately makes the decision on which organizations these funds are donated to as far as colorado law is concerned the senate majority fund is known as a 527 political organization which can receive unlimited contributions from anybody including foreign entities said steve bouey the campaign finance program manager for the colorado secretary of state s office the other organizations that crestone contributed to include independent expenditure committees which are also allowed to legally receive contributions from foreign owned corporations regardless of whether any laws were broken said graham from the campaign legal center the cppib spent a substantial amount of money trying to influence colorado voters i think it s worth bringing to the public s attention crestone peak contributed 607 500 toward the tens of millions of dollars the industry contributed during colorado s last election cycle to support groups that directly or indirectly opposed proposition 112 crestone has applied for a comprehensive drilling plan cdp to move into boulder county but the applications for drilling permits are still awaiting approval from the cogcc which is slated to meet about crestone s cdp in late april in boulder if approved the plans will have to survive an ongoing lawsuit filed by boulder county that a judge recently ruled must wait for the cogcc s final determination to move forward if crestone prevails in court the company will be subject to boulder county s new oil and gas regulations that went into place in march 2017 those regulations in turn are likely to be challenged in more lawsuits the bill that is being considered at the state legislature senate bill 181 may give more weight to boulder county s concerns for more local control however industry representatives have vowed to develop their mineral rights in accordance with whatever colorado law permits and the new law is not likely to permit blanket bans on new oil and gas development although boulder county still has not seen any new drilling since its ban was lifted the impacts of residential oil and gas development are plain to see across the county line to the east in weld county there are 21 694 active wells according to the cogcc website there residents have been powerless to stop multi well pads and mini industrial complexes from being located near homes and school playgrounds at the same time new tract homes have been built within 120 feet of existing oil and gas facilities since state regulations allow local land use decisions when they involve approving subdivisions next to oil and gas infrastructure pressure has been mounting around the state to put some brakes on the rapidly expanding oil and gas industry in colorado over the past decade repeated fires at oil and gas sites and a deadly explosion in weld county in 2017 from an abandoned pipeline located less than 200 feet from a home in firestone that killed two people only added to the tensions so have recent scientific reports that weld county s hydrocarbon production was sullying boulder county s air and contributing significantly to increasing air pollution in the denver metro region that has placed colorado in the crosshairs of the environmental protection agency for its worsening non attainment of federal clean air standards eerie colorado perhaps no place illuminates these conflicts better than erie which straddles both boulder and weld counties erie a sleepy farming community with a population of about 2 000 people in 1990 has grown to a bedroom community of about 25 000 residents today the first citizen complaint against crestone s operations with the cogcc was filed on nov 16 2016 just three months after the cppib encana deal was finalized noise from a drilling operation smack in the middle of erie was so loud it was like a huge semi truck parked in our driveway according to the anonymous complaint other complaints poured in reporting rumbling and shaking of erie homes pictures falling off of walls and disturbing vibrations night and day for weeks on end dank smells emanated from the drilling sites which were just a few hundred feet away from rows of large tract homes parks schools a skate park and even the city offices citizens started a black humor joke that their town should be renamed eerie monica korber 58 who works from her erie home as an efficiency consultant to businesses recalls trying to sleep with her bed shaking through the night fearful and concerned she asked other neighbors if they had experienced the same thing and soon dozens of people were sharing stories on social media and asking what this new company crestone was doing to rattle their lives so viscerally we never got a straight answer korber said this video was taken by a cogcc inspector and is available on its website ted wood added the text after the rumblings stopped with that phase of the project crestone pressed on soon erie residents were complaining at cogcc meetings and on the agency s website about noxious smells leaks nosebleeds headaches industrial noises and lights burning all night outside their bedroom windows korber learned that crestone was applying for even more permits to drill and drove to denver last october to speak at a cogcc meeting she told the commissioners with her best grandmother of five scolding voice i bet that not one of you lives in erie not one of the nine commissioners do erie s experience with crestone isn t isolated the number of complaints filed against crestone is almost twice as many as the next five oil and gas companies conducting business in colorado combined more than 1 000 complaints against crestone s operations were filed with the cogcc between november 2016 and february 2019 the only other company that comes anywhere close to that number is extraction oil and gas another relatively new company with holdings in many residential areas on the front range with 245 complaints over the same time period the other major operators in the d j basin including noble anadarko kerr mcgee pdc and src collectively only had 350 complaints over the same time period one likely reason most of the other top producers are operating on agricultural lands or in much less populated areas jason oates crestone s spokesperson has repeatedly stated that citizens have abused the complaint process in erie by organizing complaining campaigns in their email response to questions crestone s public relations department said that while none of the complaints resulted in a violation of state standards by the cogcc or the cdphe we knew we needed to make some changes in our operations we took an above and beyond approach to further lessen the temporary impacts that we may have on neighboring communities one such flurry of impacts and complaints came after crestone s operations caused a release of toxic gases at a site in erie that occurred just 25 yards from the aspen ridge preparatory school playground in september 2017 crestone was plugging and abandoning a set of wells and had been venting large quantities of volatile organic compounds vocs for an indeterminate amount of time before a resident smelled noxious fumes and complained to the cogcc the agency documented a large release of vocs related to oil and gas emissions that have been linked to a number of health problems in colorado and around the world including increased rates of asthma childhood leukemia and low birth weight babies those toxic emissions wafted directly onto the school playground of the kiddie academy childcare center and aspen ridge according to the cogcc s report on the incident more than 1 000 complaints against crestone s operations were filed with the cogcc between november 2016 and february 2019 the cogcc ordered crestone to cease operations until the problem was fixed but parents say they didn t hear about the leak for months mark kadlecek who has three children who attended aspen ridge found the notice of alleged violation posted on the cogcc website on oct 25 more than six weeks after the violation kadlecek wrote to the cogcc and local elected officials sputtering outrage all three of my young children between the ages of 6 and 8 years old attend aspen ridge he wrote this is a place that i thought they would be safe kadlecek tried to make the point that so many in colorado communities have reiterated what is legal in colorado is simply not right common sense mandates that oil and gas operations do not belong in close proximity to homes and schools he wrote after the public outcry crestone issued a statement that was so bland it further inflamed residents we sincerely apologize for this oversight in its emailed statement crestone added activity at the location wrapped up with no further incidents the cogcc fined crestone 10 000 according to mike leonard the agency s community relations manager christiaan van woudenberg one of erie s newly elected trustees says that the aspen ridge incident and crestone s other operations have led to one frustration after another different complaints about noise or traffic or vibrations or smells or lights or emissions need to be reported to different agencies which frequently don t report to each other the bigger picture he says is that when companies like crestone come into a small community such as erie dangling potential tax revenue and claiming as crestone spokesman oates told a community meeting that there are no health impacts from fracking it is almost impossible not to be steamrolled local elected officials in places such as erie broomfield and boulder say they are hamstrung by state laws that limit their ability to say no to new oil and gas development erie is fracked van woudenberg said in an interview we lost we re the cautionary tale a fraught investment besides the fact that crestone is seeking to operate in communities that oppose it there s a larger question for the cppib is residential drilling in colorado a smart investment crestone continues to face legal challenges that are increasing the cost of doing business in colorado the company has been involved in lawsuits protests leaks and alleged violations of state regulations in multiple communities including in weld county and broomfield a fast growing city and county halfway between boulder and denver crestone in turn has sued the state and at least one other oil and gas company alleging interference in its operations from what is known about crestone s financial picture it hasn t performed well to date while crestone is private there are several clues that the cppib s colorado investment may be problematic as of feb 15 2019 the cppib s website stated that the value of the investment had dropped to 543 million from the purchase price of 609 million more than a 10 percent decline another possible clue about crestone s financial situation comes from extraction oil and gas which went public in october 2016 at almost the same time the encana cppib crestone deal was finalized it s not possible to make a well pad to well pad comparison between the two companies since one is publicly traded and one is private with substantially different corporate structures and reporting requirements still many characteristics are similar including the fact that both companies started by purchasing larger companies toxic assets in populated communities along the front range both are buffeted by the oil price roller coaster from highs above 100 a barrel in late 2014 to a low of below 40 in early 2016 only rebounding to the high 50 range today crestone and extraction are also number one and number two in citizen complaints filed against them with the cogcc among the top six producers in the state another fiduciary clue extraction was trading for 23 a share around the time of its october 2016 ipo its stock tumbled to below 4 share more than an 80 percent drop before rebounding to 4 54 after its recent earnings report in late february 2019 it then promptly dropped to 3 60 a share in early march analysts are mixed about the future of shale development with some predicting slow growth in 2019 and others convinced that many parts of the industry are burdened with debt and uncertainty about future regulatory regimes international price fluctuations and the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technology other investors remain bullish on oil stocks but are moving away from riskier investments in politically volatile countries such as venezuela russia and saudi arabia and are looking to u s fracking operations as a safer alternative both noble energy and anadarko reported record colorado oil production in 2018 from a longer term perspective a growing number of analysts say that investments in fossil fuel companies don t make sense at a time when many fracking operations are losing money evidence mounts that oil and gas operations have significant and growing environmental and health impacts liability from abandoned wells is getting more attention and places like boulder county and california are aggressively moving towards decarbonizing their energy supply then there s climate change looming like a drilling rig s late afternoon shadow over the fossil fuel investment debate canada a signatory to the paris climate agreement faces some cognitive dissonance with the cppib s fossil fuel portfolio financial and legal analysts as well as climate activists point out that canada cannot export its fossil fuel investments and still claim it is moving to reduce its carbon footprint in a report released in january entitled it is time two canadian law professors janis sarra of the university of british columbia and cynthia williams of the osgoode hall law school at york university conclude that the cppib has enormous potential to help shift governance practice to meet the issues discussed in this report that potential has yet to be unleashed said williams in an interview canada is already heavily invested in the oil and gas sector and all recent indicators are that those investments already have a lot of risk she said partly exemplified by the drop in value of the canadian dollar and declining returns from oil and gas investments in comparison to other sectors why would the cpp be doubling down on oil and gas developments she asked various organizations in canada have tried to push the cppib toward a more sustainable lower carbon portfolio without much success said bennet of friends of the earth canada the cppib has expressly avoided committing itself to environmental social and governance esg investments stating that consistent with the cpp investment board s belief that constraints decrease returns and or increase risk over time we do not screen stocks or eliminate investments based on esg factors the cpp investment board considers the securities of any issuer all of whose businesses are lawful and would be lawful if carried on in canada as eligible for investment as many affected residents have noted what is lawful in colorado isn t necessarily admirable many state laws were written in an earlier era of oil and gas exploration they never anticipated new horizontal drilling and fracking techniques that allow companies like crestone to build pads of 10 20 and 30 wells and drill underneath hundreds of people s homes for miles in every direction these well pads are accompanied by rows of storage tanks condensers combustors separators and thousands of truck trips a day in and out of these mini industrial complexes located in close proximity to housing developments schools playgrounds watercourses and otherwise baby stroller packed suburban neighborhoods divest invest groups looking to aggressively address climate change are targeting pension funds around the world as concerns about climate change resonate across the globe investments in fossil fuel companies are increasingly seen as bad bets viable alternatives are emerging with better financial rewards in the u s the burgeoning divestment movement has made great strides in the past few years ever since stanford made headlines by selling off its coal stocks in 2014 clara vondrich the global director of divestinvest a philanthropy movement that encourages large institutional investors to move away from fossil fuels in favor of more sustainable investments said since 2014 more than 1 000 institutional investors have committed to fossil free investments with growth of capital investments rising from 52 billion to more than 8 trillion today vondrich said that the divest invest movement has three core pillars moral financial and legal the moral argument doesn t sway large institutional investors she acknowledged but the financials do various backdated investment comparisons such as those done by the u s divestment advocacy group as you sow confirm that portfolios without fossil fuel investments would have performed better than with them you re losing money for your beneficiaries by investing in fossil fuels vondrich said these are underperforming assets that are also burning up the planet now she said the cppib and other large investors increasingly have a fiduciary duty to explain why they don t divest rather than the other way around mark campanele founder of the u k based carbontracker said that huge advances in electric vehicles are another factor likely to suppress oil demand and reduce price fluctuations that invite oil speculation the question for cppib is whether betting long term on an old or dying technology such as the internal combustion engine is the sort of risk otherwise prudent pension funds should be taking on behalf of its members one driving force behind the divestment movement is the concept of stranded assets which means that the world s oil and gas reserves cannot all be extracted and burned if earth is to remain a livable planet for billions of humans since these reserves are baked into oil companies stock prices they will be faced with inventory they will never be able to sell stranded assets has moved from a fringe idea to the mainstream in part because scientists have quantified the problem in stark terms in a 2015 report published by nature the authors state that a third of oil reserves half of gas reserves and over 80 percent of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 c erie calling edmonton crestone is undeterred by the mounting complaints and continues to resist the community opposition the company is moving forward with its cdp in boulder county which is being challenged by the county weaving its way through the court system and cogcc approval process at a january 2019 conference hosted by the rocky mountain mineral law foundation crestone spokesman oates told the audience that the company had met all of the requirements laid out by the cogcc for its drilling plans and crestone would forge ahead into boulder county despite citizen and local governments objections it is how not if we are going to drill oates told the audience sara loflin executive director of the league of oil and gas impacted coloradans logic attended the conference and was taken aback by the arrogance of oates remarks in response to multiple communities concerns ever since crestone started doing business in colorado loflin said crestone has only proposed moving closer to homes in higher risk areas in larger scale developments in its email crestone disputes this and says it aims to operate safely responsibly efficiently and with minimal impact on local communities while acting as good stewards for the land air and water this is a priority for us because as coloradans we value these natural assets and we live here too back in erie grandmother of five korber says that she and her neighbors suffer not just the proximity of the industrial operations but also from the discord that those operations have unleashed on their community she has joined a lawsuit against her elected officials for not doing more to protect erie citizens korber s message to the cppib why don t you drill next to the homes of the people where you re sending those retirement checks new brunswick retiree melanson has a lot of sympathy for people like korber and plans to write a letter to the cppib it s utterly indecent what they re doing she said i don t want my pension coming from things like that unanswered questions for the cppib 1 as the encana cppib crestone deal was being negotiated several communities where encana owned colorado assets had voted to ban new hydraulic fracturing those bans were overturned by the colorado supreme court in may 2016 just months prior to the final purchase in august 2016 did that supreme court decision factor in the deal and how 2 were cppib executives aware of the conflicts surrounding residential drilling in colorado some of crestone s executives are or had been involved with all three entities encana cppib and crestone including avik dey if the executives were aware what was appealing about working there if the local residents had voted against it and remain opposed to this day 3 the cppib states that it integrate environmental social and governance factors into our investment analysis did you do an esg environmental social and governance report on the crestone encana deal and can you share that 4 crestone peak has received more than 1 000 citizen complaints on the website of the state regulatory agency the colorado oil and gas conservation commission or cogcc this number is substantially more than the five top operators in colorado combined does it trouble you that the operator has upset so many people in the communities near where it operates 5 crestone peak resources reported donating 607 500 in colorado s last election cycle to groups that were allied with the oil and gas industry as well as one that specifically opposed a citizen backed ballot initiative to increase the setbacks from schools watercourses and communities is it a normal function of the cppib to make contributions during foreign country s election campaigns was the cppib aware of them even if it is technically legal for crestone peak to make these donations does the cppib approve of this practice of its companies donating to influence local u s elections 6 many investment analysts around the world have made the case that backdated investment portfolios without fossil fuel investments fare as well or better especially over the past decade the so called divest invest movement has gained traction around the world with many institutional investors and other pension funds choosing to divest from fossil fuel investments on financial legal and or moral grounds what is the cppib s current thinking about this movement which encourages not just divestment but also investment in companies striving to respond to what the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recently suggested was a very short window for humanity to act dramatically and quickly before climate change becomes irreversible 7 in the credentialed scientific community there is virtually no disagreement that the planet is warming human activities are largely responsible and the burning of fossil fuels are a main cause of this warming and ancillary impacts how do executives at cppib view this science such as the recent ipcc report warning of severe climate related threats to humanity how do you view your continued investment in fossil fuel companies is there any cognitive dissonance in canada trying to attain those goals in canada and the cppib investing in more hydrocarbon exploration and production elsewhere

president and ceo stuart brown commented financial year 2018 was mountain province s first full year of commercial production at the new gahcho kué mine and we are pleased with its operational performance the gahcho kué mine has settled down well and has outperformed our initial expectations in terms of throughput and overall diamond production which is an excellent achievement this trend has continued into 2019 with the mine continuing to perform substantially ahead of expectations financial year 2019 is expected to be another strong year of production we are confident that we will meet or exceed our production targets as we have done in the last two years along with our joint venture partner de beers canada we are working on various short and medium term initiatives which will have a positive impact on the future of the gahcho kué mine these relate to improvement of production rates and extending the life of mine by including additional jv ore discovered during 2018 and we look forward to updating the market as we complete these tasks later in 2019 in addition to the jv related improvements we are also focussing on the wholly owned kennady advanced stage diamondiferous kimberlites and near mine exploration opportunities and will update the market on our progress in due course the company also delivered very good results from its sales process selling all of its production made available during 2018 which translated into good operating margins further demonstrating the ability of the ore bodies at the gahcho kué mine to deliver strong free cash flow the rough diamond market experienced a relatively difficult finish to the year with price pressure in the smaller and lower quality diamond categories although we did see a stabilisation of prices towards the end of the year and so far we have seen a small improvement in the lower quality categories at the start of 2019 the company s longer term view of the fundamentals of the diamond business remain positive and combined with the quality of the gahcho kué mine with its long life and high margins we believe we are well positioned for the future to benefit even more with improved diamond prices 2019 is a year of innovation and assessing how to improve the returns to shareholders and i am positive that the work we are doing together with de beers will deliver on this throughout the year ahead

4 9 from 5 0 reflected a decline in the participation rate 65 6 vs 65 7 australia created a third of the jobs forecast 4 6k vs 15k and there was a loss of 7 3k full time posts similarly in new zealand the optics look good but the details are less inspiring growth in q4 accelerated from 0 3 in q3 to 0 6 however the year over year pace slowed to 2 3 from 2 6 its slowest pace since 2014 investors are closely watching asian trade figures for signs of a recovery south korea reported that exports for the first 20 days of march fell 4 9 year over year here the news is really better than the optics this decline shows a recovery from the first 10 days when exports cratered nearly 12 imports were off 3 4 after a 17 3 slump in the first 10 days separately after keeping rates on hold as expected note that indonesia taiwan and the philippines also kept policy steady today thailand reported an unexpected 5 9 gain in february exports year over year they had fallen 5 65 in january imports on the other hand imploded falling 10 after a 14 rise in january the trade balance swung into surplus the 4 bln surplus is the second largest since at least the early 1990s the hong kong monetary authority again intervened today to support the hong kong dollar the size of the intervention remains modest and its take time for the cumulative effect to take hold part of the pressure is coming from interest rate differentials so the dovish fed may help take some near term pressure off however some of the pressure appears to be coming from capital flows into the mainland bond and stock markets consider that the mainland premium over the us on 10 year bonds has widened to over 60 bp a nearly 20 bp increase over the past month the australian dollar approached 0 7170 its best level this month the momentum could carry it closer to 0 7200 but we expect it to be seen as a lower risk sale near there the dollar reversed lower against the yen yesterday outside down day and slipped a little more today jpy110 30 though local markets were on holiday we suspect we have seen or approached the low and expect japanese investors to take advantage of the yen s gains to buy foreign assets there is an expiring 415 mln option struck at jpy110 60 that could be in play china set the reference rate for the dollar at its lowest level since july dipping below cny6 67 but throughout the mainland session the dollar gradually clawed back some of the losses to closed a little above cny6 69 europe brexit remains a mess reports suggest that ec president juncker cautioned the uk prime minister against requesting a delay past the european parliament elections end of may prime minister may went ahead and sought a delay until the end of june that little episode offers a microcosm of the entire process may did not offer anything new and of course some other countries are balking just like labour leader corbyn walked out of a meeting with the prime minister because he did not think that former labour umunna who now heads up his own small party is not legitimate so too does corbyn s talk with eu officials amount to much his plan is to stay in the customs union but he is not authorized to speak for the uk indeed despite the mess of brexit labour under corbyn continues to trail in national polls behind the conservatives a third vote on the withdrawal bill looks likely next tuesday or wednesday according to reports there is headline risk from today s eu summit there will likely be another summit next week norges bank the central bank of norway raised rates 25 bp today it is the second hike in the cycle the first was delivered last september it signaled additional hikes were likely underlying inflation is a little above target and the oil sector is doing well we are less sanguine industrial output fell 2 2 in the month of january and although january mainland gdp rose 0 3 it was flat in november and december separately the swiss national bank stood pat as widely anticipated its deposit rate remains at minus 75 bp the uk reported a 0 4 rise in retail sales the median forecast from the bloomberg survey was for a 0 4 decline it follows a 0 9 rise in january it is consistent with a recent string of constructive data a month ago the market was nearly split over the chances of a rate hike by the end of the year now there is about a one in five chance as widely expected the boe left policy on hold today there has been little market impact from center right dutch government losing its senate majority yesterday fvd anti immigration populist party has moved into second place it shows that the appeal of populism is not simply in southern europe it is finding root in prosperous successful countries as well the wave does not look as if it has crest yet see european parliament elections the euro traded almost to 1 1450 yesterday after the fomc but has not seen follow through buying today we had anticipated a test on 1 1400 this week after the ecb induced drop below 1 12 while acknowledging the fed was more dovish than expected we don t see the euro sustaining an upside break above the upper end of the 1 13 1 15 range that continues to confine most of the euro s price action the 200 day moving average is found near 1 1480 there are 2 5 bln euro in options between 1 1415 and 1 1430 that expire today support is pegged in the 1 1360 1 1370 area sterling

was more dovish than expected the one rate hike many economists including ourselves anticipated was pushed into next year the balance sheet unwind will be taper sooner than expected and the confirmed end in september the earliest date expected the fed s forecasts reflect an economy that is perceived to be past its cyclical peak powell said the us economy is fundamentally strong and the outlook was positive despite projecting above trend growth this year and next and below 4 unemployment with inflation remaining around the 2 target the fed deems it necessary to still provide monetary stimulus the narrative that the fed typically is slow to respond than overreacts to inflation choking off the expansion is far from the mark though it is repeated ad nauseam the last three downturns were the function of financial excess and crisis s l tech bubble and the great financial crisis the us sees the march philly fed manufacturing survey it is expected to rebound from february s 4 1 reading

hong kong bay area brings hk opportunities chief executive carrie lam the global economy is inevitably facing considerable uncertainties caused notably by the protracted trade dispute between the united states and china impasse over brexit as well as other events in january the imf international monetary fund revised downward the 2019 global growth forecast to 3 5 and in oecd organisation for economic co operation development s latest interim economic outlook report published earlier this month it predicted that the world economy would grow by 3 3 in 2019 a downward adjustment of 0 2 percentage points compared to its last forecast in november 2018 for hong kong we expect our real gdp to expand by 2 to 3 this year following 3 growth in 2018 and 3 8 growth in 2017 of course we would love to see a better than expected growth amid the recent encouraging signs that the us china trade negotiations are heading to an amicable outcome however we know that trade issues aside there are other deep seated differences between china and the united states these will not be easy to resolve certainly not in the short term and whether hong kong a special administrative region sar of the people s republic of china enjoying a high degree of autonomy will suffer further collateral damage is yet to be seen creating connections but what is clear to me is hong kong this vibrant economy rated as the world s freest economy by the heritage foundation 25 years in a row second most competitive economy by the international institute for management development and fourth easiest place to do business by the world bank is again displaying her resilience and can do spirit to turn challenges into opportunities why do i say this this is because amidst those difficulties and uncertainties in the west many people and investors are increasingly looking to the east possessing unique strengths under one country two systems and essential assets such as the rule of law the independence of the judiciary strong professional services clean and efficient government etc hong kong is asia s world city in overseas promotions targeting businesses in other parts of the world we deploy the tag line think asia think hong kong whereas if we are talking to businesses in asia venturing to connect with the west we say think global think hong kong for several decades hong kong is good at connecting economies companies people and ideas hong kong has long been the multilevel bridge between mainland china and the rest of the world creating the connections that reward commitment creativity and effort and connections that help us all excel our ability to leverage on our strengths and our international connectivity has enabled us to excel in a major national strategic initiative the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area that peter has put a spotlight on in his address highlighting the vast economic growth opportunities it presents for hong kong macao and the nine guangdong cities that make up this ambitious city cluster of 70 million people and a combined gdp of some us 1 6 trillion i am pleased to say that work on the greater bay area is progressing well and progressing fast for example a an ambitious outline development plan was promulgated by the central government on february 18 2019 b a high level leading group chaired by vice premier han zheng was set up last year to provide overall steer and effective co ordination and for the first time the chief executives of the hong kong sar and the macao sar are members of this central leadership group the leading group has already met twice giving clear indications and directions on a range of issues notably the development of an international innovation and technology hub in the greater bay area c tangible measures have been rolled out to facilitate free flow of people goods capital etc in the greater bay area including two tax measures much welcomed by the people of hong kong and d there has been growing interest abroad about the greater bay area which has prompted the three governments to conduct joint promotions overseas with the first destination being tokyo japan next month the greater bay area will certainly bring new opportunities to the region and provide hong kong with new impetus to grow her economy and improve people s livelihood adopting new roles peter has in his opening remarks portrayed a new investing age for investors and aptly provided the advice that investors should look into new markets new technologies and new approaches in order to seize the many opportunities the hong kong sar government is committed to enhancing the business and investment environment for all and to do so i have advocated also three new s a new style of governance created new roles for government and adopted a new fiscal philosophy let me briefly illustrate these in our efforts to enhance our financial services industry hong kong is ranked the world s number three in the latest global financial centres index we are the world s largest offshore rmb centre funds raised through initial public offerings ipos came first in the world for six out of the past 10 years including last year at a total of us 36 5 billion raised through ipos under a new proactive style of governance i set up a financial leaders forum in 2017 shortly after taking office chaired by the financial secretary to take a visionary view of hong kong s financial services development and put in place practical policy measures to support the industry these include enhancing our listing regime to accommodate the emerging and innovative companies with weighted voting rights and pre revenue biotechnology businesses expediting the use of fintech with the introduction of the faster payment system now serving over 2 million customers and the issue of virtual banking licences shortly growing the bond market with a pilot bond grant scheme and promoting green finance through a government green bond programme and subsidies for qualified green bond issuers in introducing these new measures we are mindful of ensuring adequate investor protection monetary stability as well as market consultation and transparency we are fully aware of the potential of the emerging asia and to tap that potential the hong kong sar government has to adopt some new roles apart from being a public service provider and a regulator i have required my government bureaux and departments to also perform the role of a facilitator and a promoter one aspect of work that stands out in the past 20 months under this guidance is the emphasis we put on government to government co operation and entering into multilateral and bilateral agreements to provide a better operating environment for businesses and professionals these include a total of five free trade agreements signed or concluded including one with the 10 member nations of asean association of southeast asian nations and one with australia these also include comprehensive double taxation agreements investment promotion protection agreements mutual recognition of funds and expansion in our international network just over three weeks ago i was in bangkok and this was my third trip to bangkok after taking office for the formal opening of our economic trade office there our 13th overseas office and third in asean that speaks of the importance my government places on asean we have plans to set up similar new offices in dubai moscow mumbai and seoul my new fiscal philosophy aims at wisely using our accumulated surpluses to invest for hong kong s future and to increase hong kong s competitiveness since taking office i have allocated over us 1 billion recurrent expenditure for education and committed some us 13 billion expenditure for innovation and technology while maintaining a simple tax system we have rolled out two tax concessions from the current fiscal year with the introduction of a two tiered profits tax lowering the tax rate to only 8 25 for the first hk 2 million of profits and a super tax deduction to incentivise private businesses investment in research and development also starting from april this year different types of onshore and offshore funds meeting certain conditions will be eligible for profits tax exemption and the financial secretary is studying the case of introducing a more competitive tax environment to attract private equity funds to set up and operate in hong kong hong kong s asset management industry was already managing a total asset value of us 3 1 trillion in 2017 but i believe hong kong enjoys an unparalleled edge in further developing the asset management business hong kong s strengths in financial services are clearly recognised in the greater bay area outline development plan unveiled last month the greater bay area will strengthen our status as a global offshore rmb business hub and international asset and risk management centre coupled with our efficient links to other major commercial centres around the world as well as our financial regulatory and supervisory framework that follows international standards hong kong can help promote an efficient flow of factors of production within the greater bay area to support the development of the real economy the new roles and initiatives i have mentioned will help hong kong seize the many opportunities arising from the greater bay area in my opinion the key to the success of the greater bay area will be in working together in complementing our respective strengths certainly the market size of the greater bay area and its advanced and comprehensive industrial system offers much for hong kong businesses at the same time hong kong has much to offer to the greater bay area hong kong is a global city free and open to business with world class strengths in financial and professional services and a legal system rooted in the rule of law above all we have the unique advantage under the one country two systems framework a framework that shapes our relations with the mainland and the world beyond financial services the plan recognises hong kong s strengths as well in trade and transport research and technology and aviation as an international aviation hub hong kong international airport last year handled a record breaking 74 million passengers and 5 1 million tonnes of cargo and air mail the airport s three runway system now under construction will further strengthen connections between hong kong the mainland and the world meanwhile with the timely commissioning of the high speed train and the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge last year land based connectivity between hong kong and the greater bay area mainland cities as well as macao has been strengthened chief

breaking allies increasingly doubt u s commitment today and in the future former u s secretary of defense jim mattis warned in his resignation letter to president trump while the u s remains the indispensable nation in the free world we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies having served as a shock absorber for the first two years of the trump administration secretary mattis knew just how thin u s policy was wearing with u s allies since his departure what was happening behind closed doors is out in the open in recent months the philippines demanded a u s affirmation of commitment to defend its territory in the south china sea under the terms of the bilateral 1951 mutual defense treaty mdt setting a slippery slope precedent u s secretary of state mike pompeo recently publicly reaffirmed u s commitment hoping to forestall a threatened review by some in the philippines government of the mdt under the chaotic duterte presidency the philippines is merely the most vocal of u s allies but it s hardly the only one in the indo pacific asking these questions of u s resolve to honor mutual defense commitments and wondering whether they want to get drawn into commitments of their own as tensions rise between the united states and china as the united states walks away from multilateralism in the region in favor of a bilateral approach concern is waxing and willingness to cooperate is waning in europe nato allies are reeling from the way u s withdrawal from syria was announced by all reports the decision was made on the fly by president trump following a late december phone call with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan during which president trump said about syria t s all yours we are done since that time others in the administration and particularly the pentagon have walked the president back to a 1 000 strong enduring u s force presence in syria but europeans remain furious over the lack of consultation which the president repeated regarding u s enduring troop presence in afghanistan where nato allies have spent blood and treasure over the past 18 years no surprise then that not a single nato ally committed forces several weeks ago when the united states pivoted back to u s allies to request troop commitments for syria even going so far as to impose a deadline on demand that resounding silence is the first total brushoff from nato allies in recent memory even at the height of the furor over the iraq war under the george w bush administration there was commitment of forces from nato allies europeans are similarly breaking ranks on u s calls to keep chinese companies out of 5g networks and they re broadly going their own way on china policy due to lack of u s consultation on trade talks among other issues tensions between the united states and its allies could become much much worse in coming months if the trump administration moves forward with the president s reported focus on a cost plus 50 arrangement to u s bases abroad allies also remain concerned about the next lurch in u s trade policy including possible auto tariffs and the problem is unlikely to go away under a new administration there is a growing sense among u s allies that u s retrenchment and unilateralism under the trump administration may not be outliers in u s policy but a trendline they must account for in future planning many in europe still have a bitter taste from the lead up to the 2003 iraq war and deep disappointment in u s response to the syrian civil war and resulting refugee crisis frontrunning 2020 democratic candidates have been notably quiet on the importance of alliances as well and public views of the united states from allies certainly make it politically convenient for leaders to step back from working closely with the united states including a recent pew research poll that finds u s favorability ratings at historic lows and another gallup poll in which china now eclipses the united states in global approval and russia equals it 3 pressure to fragment global supply chains is intensifying growing regulation and scrutiny by the u s government of technology trade with china has rightly raised for businesses the question of whether they should restructure global supply chains to bifurcate u s bound and u s sourced inputs and products from china bound and china sourced inputs and products this challenge is also being felt in the digital domain as china builds out its own global approach to digital products and services under its digital silk road initiative an offshoot of the 1 trillion belt and road initiative u s digital services companies have for years been forced to navigate china s censorship and data localization requirements now chinese information and communication technology ict and digital companies are falling under u s national security scrutiny with the united states taking a strong stance with its allies not to integrate chinese commercial technology into their next generation 5g telecommunications networks or face potential reductions in u s intelligence cooperation congress is closely watching ongoing trade talks to decide whether it needs to step in to address the structural issues threatening u s future prosperity and security last year congress passed the foreign investment risk review modernization act and export control and reform act chinese companies have broadly accepted a presumption of denial in a range of potential u s investments and acquisitions and u s companies in turn are losing appetite for new investments into china with so many uncertainties about the future contours of the relationship another wildcard is europe s parallel movement on scrutiny of chinese tech transfer alongside its increasingly protectionist posture toward its own technology base as mentioned under the last risk item europe and the united states are pursuing these similar ends quite independently and when taking into account the additional layer of data privacy standards where europe has been particularly aggressive in protecting its citizens at the expense of u s high tech companies it s not difficult to envision a trifurcated world related japan is in talks with the european union about creating a shared data governance standard it hopes to involve the united states and others to set norms in sharp contrast with the direction china is taking the internet the hook is this we re talking about completely unraveling the global economy it s wishful thinking that the united states and china can file for a neat divorce supply chains are deeply intertangled there s a reason tim cook has spent so much time at the white house and that xi jinping has met more with u s business leaders than u s officials over the past two years a move from market to state directed supply chain planning and operations would likely place a significant drag across a range of sectors and industries reflected in immediate economic slowdown and consumer price increases beyond tariffs to date 4 alternatives to capitalism are trending in case you hadn t noticed socialism is no longer a cringeworthy word and it s not just the bernie 2020 campaign and the arrival of congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez driving this change to an increasing number of americans who never lived through the cold war socialism doesn t invoke life behind the iron curtain but rather an idyllic life of center left nordic governments with zero student loan debt generous parental leave and free health care the progressive arm of the democratic party which took off after the 2016 election and claimed serious ground in the 2018 midterms is happy to look beyond free market capitalism for cures to perceived social ills its ideas have already taken the party by storm a two pronged litmus test has emerged for all 2020 democratic hopefuls endorsement of single payer healthcare and the new green deal this hasn t gone unnoticed by republicans including president trump s rejoinder in his state of the union address tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country but polling data suggests that republicans are likely on the losing end of a trendline dating back at least to 2010 their own experience with the failed repeal of the affordable care act and the continued state expansion of medicaid should be instructive in reading the mood of the country when it comes to interest in government playing a substantially different role in the broader u s economy gallup polling from last year revealed that 47 percent of democrats have a positive view of capitalism compared with 57 percent that holds a positive view of socialism the trend also holds for all voters ages 18 29 with only 45 percent with a positive view of capitalism and 51 percent with a positive view of socialism president trump redirected u s concerns about fairness in wealth inequality and perceived global winners and losers on the issue of trade in the last election this election we can expect democrats to push the idea that it s far less about trade and more about the underlying winner take all approach to the free market senator elizabeth warren s campaign promises to put the focus back on u s corporations and in particular large tech companies she doesn t accuse them of outsourcing jobs but of rigging the overall system so that it isn t competitive or fair for new entrants or workers there is similar furor with drug companies and health costs something the trump administration has only dabbled in leaving it vulnerable to democratic attacks in the lead up to 2020 there s also a growing interest among democrats across all wings of the party in the idea of massive government stimulus a return to a mixed economy and limited industrial policy focused on growing a new american middle class signature initiatives under discussion include infrastructure investment a rapid move from hydrocarbons to renewable energy green collar jobs and broad job retraining and upskilling to get ahead of an anticipated automation onslaught 5 designer babies are here it is no exaggeration to say that humans now hold the potential to control their own evolution crispr an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats is essentially a cut and paste function for dna editing in organisms from the most basic bacteria to humans while the technology has been in use for only five years it has already transformed biosciences with remarkable possibilities and frightening potentials in november 2018 mit technology review broke headline news exclusive chinese scientists are creating crispr babies he jiankui and his team at the southern university of science and technology in shenzhen announced that contrary to an agreed upon worldwide ban on the practice by the scientific community he and his research team had genetically altered a viable human embryo resulting in the live birth of twins lulu and nana his research purpose he assured the world was noble create a human resistant to hiv smallpox and cholera a global furor followed the announcement shockingly the changes made to the dna of the babies were germline edited meaning heritable to any children the twins may have in the future the chinese government reacted to the furor by denying involvement in the undertaking placing he under apparent house arrest blaming him alone for the event and even threatening the death penalty further investigation suggests that elements of the chinese government might have been behind the research raising questions about what else might be ongoing in china and elsewhere in recent days leading global scientific researchers have called for a global moratorium on human testing of genome editing until an agreed international framework can be put into place but even the co discoverers of the technology are split with some arguing that such restriction would fail to constrain the worst practices while denying the benefits of the technology existing regulations are nation by nation and fuzzy in what they permit they can be very difficult to enforce considering the ease and availability of crispr technology crispr is so easy to use that there is even an online enthusiast community of do it yourself biohackers who have edited their own dna inspiring the u s food and drug administration to issue a warning about the safety of such activities more alarming yet biosecurity researchers

from december 13 to december 24 2018 the dow jones industrial average fell by 2805 points despite a substantial surge on december 26 the us stock market finished the year at a loss relative to where it began even the wider russell 3000 index which attempts to capture almost all of the us stock market as opposed to the dow which tracks the value of 30 large companies showed the value of american stocks in their totality ending 2018 lower than where they started capital therefore did not accumulate but relative to the year s high point something on the order of 4 trillion of wealth disappeared or never existed in the first place on december 30 michael mackenzie wrote in a financial times column entitled december drama ends bleak year for markets that it has left pretty much every major asset class in the red for the year how should we interpret such a fall in the value of global capital is this the beginning of a wider crisis as the apparently unstoppable process of capital accumulation grinds to a halt has anything like this happened before can the past give us any guidance about what is happening and why mackenzie refers to every major asset class and what is really striking about 2018 is that almost nothing was safe that isn t how financial markets are supposed to work equity isn t debt after all if you lose confidence in some borrower s ability to repay you would get out of debt and decide to really own something instead so you d buy stock if you worried that your stock was overvalued and the companies you d bought into weren t as profitable as you expected you d sell your stock before it fell and maybe get into something safe and predictable like government debt there is a financial instrument for everything and you are supposed to always be able to diversify to find investments that fit any appetite for risk but unfortunately you can t diversify away from systemic risk financial history is sufficiently rich in crises to provide examples for any point you might want to make except perhaps for the idea that markets are rational efficient and self regulating a brief look at moments of turmoil in the past two centuries is useful for understanding our contemporary moment the year 1819 saw a financial panic in the united states having grown worried about inflation the second bank of the united states contracted credit it provided to state banks which in turn called in the farm mortgages they had overextended in the preceding boom years coinciding with a fall in agricultural prices that made it more difficult for farmers to pay their debts the state banks foreclosed on many of these loans and transferred them to their own creditor which was the bank of the united states land prices dropped as over indebted farmers and desperate banks all tried to sell land simultaneously the price of cotton fell 25 in a single day and the us entered a liquidity crisis as everybody owed everybody money and nobody could get cash to pay with the ensuing recession ground on for years and if it is remembered at all today it is as america s first peacetime economic crisis by 1821 congress passed some limited debt relief and public demands for tariffs increased ultimately producing the famous tariff of abominations in 1828 by contrast the year 1919 was bookended by recessions the first was short and relatively mild resulting from postwar monetary imbalances in europe and the labor market effects of returning soldiers it ended by the middle of 1919 to be followed by a short sharp recession starting in late december and early january 1920 that recession was distinctive for the single most dramatic one year deflation in us history as prices fell by 14 18 from december 1919 through june 1920 the newly created federal reserve raised interest rates from 4 75 to 7 contracting the money supply and returning the price level from wartime inflation to the strictures of the gold standard raising interest rates means people save instead of spend in order to receive interest on their savings which reduces sales and driving unprofitable businesses under it is more expensive to borrow at high interest rates so fewer people buy houses or land and fewer businesses expand production in short higher interest rates reduce economic activity and if raised very fast and very high they induce recessions that is not an accident of monetary policy it is part of what monetary policy is in 1920 unemployment increased rapidly president wilson did essentially nothing and after taking office in 1921 president harding increased tariffs and cut income taxes there is something both pleasing and alarming about this century after century recurrence none of these crises connect to each other in any meaningful way but there are a few striking patterns in them that cast some light on what exactly is going on at the moment in the world of international finance the 1819 and 1920 crises were not stock market crises but crises caused by monetary policy monetary policy is probably the most important determining factor in our lives monetary policy can cause recessions or shorten them it determines how much your student loans cost whether you can afford a mortgage whether your life savings erodes and whether you can find a job but unlike patriarchy or structural racism you could fit everyone responsible for monetary policy into a single police van in normal times monetary policy is conducted through raising and lowering interest rates by small increments in the wake of the 2008 crisis however central bankers adopted what ben bernanke called unconventional policies which mainly consisted of buying up huge amounts of worthless or risky assets from banks and other financial institutions with absolutely no public discussion at all the federal reserve spent 2009 2014 in a gargantuan project of quantitative easing buying tens of billions of dollars of financial assets every month injecting a total of about 4 47 trillion in liquidity into the global financial system they kept interest rates close to zero until federal reserve chair janet yellen started slowly to raise them in late 2015 the european central bank began its own quantitative easing in 2015 pumping about 2 8 trillion into the european banking sector the ecb announced the end of that spigot of cash on december 13 2018 in other words the anemic economy of the last decade has only been as robust as it was on the back of trillions of dollars of largesse from central banks to the private banking sector mostly that money not been recycled into cheap loans for businesses homeowners and students but rather into buying back their own stock rebuilding their reserves in 2015 us banks held 2 4 trillion in excess reserves and dispensing steadily increasing compensation to their top executives now that the stream of central bank liquidity is coming to an end it appears that the process of capital accumulation itself doesn t work the way it used to except on a steady supply of cheap money the crises of 1819 and 1919 followed extended periods of emergency in which wars justified extraordinary government spending and far more central bank liquidity than was permitted by the classical gold standard in each case the attempt to return to normality brought with it deflation bankruptcy unemployment and crisis we are used to thinking about theorizing and historicizing the apparently permanent state of political and military emergency that has persisted since september 2001 but there has been another state of emergency in effect since september 2008 one conducted with even less public oversight and more international cooperation and unlike the endless war on terror the years of open ended commitments by central banks to supporting the financial system are now drawing to a close most people have experienced the emergency in monetary policy secondhand mediated through how difficult it is to find a job or buy a house most people are not bankers indeed only about half of americans have any stock at all and about 87 of all equity is owned by the top 10 of equity owners we who do not receive quantitative easing assume that an end to emergency means a return to stability peace and the rule of law but in the world of finance it appears more likely that an end to emergency means a crisis because with the exception of the 1945 1971 interregnum which incidentally was the only period in human history with substantial restrictions on international capital flows economic normality itself is a state of constant crisis i do not know if 2019 and 2020 will be as economically turbulent as 1919 and 1819 were and neither does anybody else whether through a manufacturing slump provoked by trump s trade war or through a domestic credit crunch there are ominous signs of slowing in the chinese economy paired against the unimaginable consequences of impeding brexit and the aforementioned turmoil in financial markets but no matter what happens our contemporary moment is fundamentally the product of the deep inequality in policy responses during the decade since the 2008 crisis it is impossible not to read the delegitimation of the old neoliberal political consensus as a result of the emergency decision that gave bailouts to some and austerity to others we are only beginning to discover the staggering human toll of austerity the magnitude of the bailouts was likewise far greater than the public realized not an 800 billion escape hatch in late 2008 but trillions of dollars in a continual flood for a decade inequality was starker more extensive more structural than anyone realized we will yet see how years of austerity and increasing inequality respond to the end of the state of financial emergency

the fourth quarter gross margin included the benefit of a cvd reversal of 16 1 million excluding the cvd reversal benefits gross margin would be 28 3 compared to 25 0 in the third quarter of 2018 the revised fourth quarter guidance was 27 0 to 28 0 the sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to the realization of deferred module profits after project sales and a lower blended module manufacturing cost partially offset by a lower average module selling price the year over year increase in gross margin was primarily due to the benefit of the cvd reversal and a lower blended module manufacturing cost partially offset by a lower average module selling price gross margin for the company s mss business in the fourth quarter 2018 was 31 7 or 28 8 excluding the cvd reversal benefit this compares to a gross margin of 25 1 in the third quarter 2018 or 23 4 excluding the cvd reversal benefit in that quarter and 15 4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin for the company s energy business for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 27 5 compared to 28 2 in the third quarter of 2018 and 27 9 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company has been operating in two principal businesses since 2016 mss and energy the mss business comprises primarily the design development manufacture and sale of solar modules other solar power products and solar system kits the mss business also provides engineering procurement and construction epc and operating and maintenance o m services the energy business comprises primarily the development and sale of solar projects operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity the module sales from the company s mss business to its energy business are on terms and conditions similar to sales to third parties the company develops solar power projects worldwide where applicable the company may apply for and or be entitled to receive a feed in tariff fit for its projects alternatively the company may participate in public or private energy auctions and bidding which results in long term power purchase agreements ppa the company may also sell all or part of the electricity generated from its solar power projects on the merchant power market because of the longer lead time two to four years to develop solar power projects and bring them to a commercial operation date cod the actual gross margin for a project may deviate from the expected gross margin the deviation may be caused by but are not limited to changes in the political and economic conditions in host countries project specific conditions price movements of solar modules and other components epc services and the capital return requirements of solar asset buyers in recent years the company has sold some solar power projects before cod we typically refer these sales as notice to proceed or ntp sales revenue will be lower while gross margin percentage will be higher in ntp sales compared to cod sales even if the absolute margin is the same results from the company s energy business may be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on project ntp or cod dates project sale transaction dates and the profit level of each project the

fourth quarter and full year 2018 our integrated business strategy and commitment to profitability helped us achieve a new high for canadian solar as we delivered net income of 3 88 per diluted share the acceleration on the sale of certain solar power projects also positively contributed to the revenue and profit in 2018 however this will reduce our project sales revenue and profit in 2019 as noted in our outlook our portfolio of solar power plants in operation as of february 28 2019 was approximately 986 mwp with an estimated total resale value of approximately 1 2 billion our portfolio of late stage utility scale solar power projects as of february 28 2019 including those under construction was approximately 2 9 gwp our focus remains on downstream energy business where we can

to uncertainty on final customer demand solar project construction and sale schedules management s views and estimates are subject to change without notice for the first quarter of 2019 the company expects total solar module shipments to be in the range of approximately 1 3 gw to 1 4 gw including approximately 50 mw of shipments to the company s utility scale solar power projects that may not be recognized as revenue in first quarter 2019 total revenue for the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be in the range of 450 million to 480 million gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be between 16 and 18 the company expects the net profit for the first quarter of 2019 to be low or negative primarily due to typical lower production and sales volume during the chinese new year holiday it upgrade a lower module asp decreased sales of solar power projects compared to previous quarters and an expected foreign exchange loss due to the appreciation of the chinese rmb against the u s dollar for the full year 2019 the company expects total module shipments to be in the range of approximately 7 4 gw to 7 8 gw total revenue for the full year 2019 is expected to be in the range of 3 5 billion to 3 8 billion the full year revenue guidance reflects the impact of an expected lower module asp and lower revenue from solar project sales while the profit in subsequent quarters will likely recover from the first quarter of 2019 level as module and project sales increase the company currently expects its net profit for 2019 to be lower than 2018 dr shawn qu chairman and chief executive officer of canadian solar commented we had an exceptional year in 2018 with close to 140 growth of net profit from the 2017 level this clearly demonstrated our global leadership position the winning model of our solar project business and the benefits of our manufacturing business strategy as we discussed previously the acceleration of certain high profit project sales also contributed to our success in 2018 this acceleration however will result in a reduction in solar project sale revenue and profit in 2019 and while we have a strong 2 9 gwp late stage solar project pipeline due to the typical project development cycle we expect to realize sales for the majority of these late stage projects in 2020 or later this will likely create a temporary pullback in 2019 compared to 2018 we also expect lower profit from our module manufacturing business partly due to higher costs caused by the appreciation of the chinese rmb against the u s dollar and euro over the past few months such cost increases would normally be offset by an adjustment of module asp or by the cost reduction through technology improvements but that process takes time dr shawn qu continued overall while we expect 2019 financial results to be lower than 2018 due to the timing issues noted this does not change our view on the long term health growth and profitability of our core business we expect a rebound in project sales in 2020 and beyond given our robust project pipeline our focus on new solar module technologies innovative products and premium channels will also help the company maintain its competitive edge in its module and solar system business we will continue to focus on delivering improved results and maximizing shareholder value recent developments on february 15 2019 canadian

since 2016 mss and energy the mss business comprises primarily the design development manufacture and sale of solar modules other solar power products and solar system kits the mss business also provides engineering procurement and construction epc and operating and maintenance o m services the energy business comprises primarily the development and sale of solar projects operating solar power projects and the sale of electricity the module sales from the company s mss business to its energy business are on terms and conditions similar to sales to third parties the company develops solar power projects worldwide where applicable the company may apply for and or be entitled to receive a feed in tariff fit for its projects alternatively the company may participate in public or private energy auctions and bidding which results in long term power purchase agreements ppa the company may also sell all or part of the electricity generated from its solar power projects on the merchant power market because of the longer lead time two to four years to develop solar power projects and bring them to a commercial operation date cod the actual gross margin for a project may deviate from the expected gross margin the deviation may be caused by but are not limited to changes in the political and economic conditions in host countries project specific conditions price movements of solar modules and other components epc services and the capital return requirements of solar asset buyers in recent years the company has sold some solar power projects before cod we typically refer these sales as notice to proceed or ntp sales revenue will be lower while gross margin percentage will be higher in ntp sales compared to cod sales even if the absolute margin is the same results from the company s energy business may be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on project ntp or cod dates project sale transaction dates and the profit level of each project the

fourth quarter and full year 2018 our integrated business strategy and commitment to profitability helped us achieve a new high for canadian solar as we delivered net income of 3 88 per diluted share the acceleration on the sale of certain solar power projects also positively contributed to the revenue and profit in 2018 however this will reduce our project sales revenue and profit in 2019 as noted in our outlook our portfolio of solar power plants in operation as of february 28 2019 was approximately 986 mwp with an estimated total resale value of approximately 1 2 billion our portfolio of late stage utility scale solar power projects as of february 28 2019 including those under construction was approximately 2 9 gwp our focus remains on downstream energy business where we can

completion of the fourth quarter 2018 sales of 470 mwp solar projects in the u s 247 mwp of solar power plants in china and our 20 interests in the 399 mwp pirapora portfolio in brazil our ability to

business outlook is based on management s views and estimates with respect to market conditions production capacity the current order book and the global economic environment this outlook is subject to uncertainty on final customer demand solar project construction and sale schedules management s views and estimates are subject to change without notice for the first quarter of 2019 the company expects total solar module shipments to be in the range of approximately 1 3 gw to 1 4 gw including approximately 50 mw of shipments to the company s utility scale solar power projects that may not be recognized as revenue in first quarter 2019 total revenue for the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be in the range of 450 million to 480 million gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be between 16 and 18 the company expects the net profit for the first quarter of 2019 to be low or negative primarily due to typical lower production and sales volume during the chinese new year holiday it upgrade a lower module asp decreased sales of solar power projects compared to previous quarters and an expected foreign exchange loss due to the appreciation of the chinese rmb against the u s dollar for the full year 2019 the company expects total module shipments to be in the range of approximately 7 4 gw to 7 8 gw total revenue for the full year 2019 is expected to be in the range of 3 5 billion to 3 8 billion the full year revenue guidance reflects the impact of an expected lower module asp and lower revenue from solar project sales while the profit in subsequent quarters will likely recover from the first quarter of 2019 level as module and project sales increase the company currently expects its net profit for 2019 to be lower than 2018 dr shawn qu chairman and chief executive officer of canadian solar commented we had an exceptional year in 2018 with close to 140 growth of net profit from the 2017 level this clearly demonstrated our global leadership position the winning model of our solar project business and the benefits of our manufacturing business strategy as we discussed previously the acceleration of certain high profit project sales also contributed to our success in 2018 this acceleration however will result in a reduction in solar project sale revenue and profit in 2019 and while we have a strong 2 9 gwp late stage solar project pipeline due to the typical project development cycle we expect to realize sales for the majority of these late stage projects in 2020 or later this will likely create a temporary pullback in 2019 compared to 2018 we also expect lower profit from our module manufacturing business partly due to higher costs caused by the appreciation of the chinese rmb against the u s dollar and euro over the past few months such cost increases would normally be offset by an adjustment of module asp or by the cost reduction through technology improvements but that process takes time dr shawn qu continued overall while we expect 2019 financial results to be lower than 2018 due to the timing issues noted this does not change our view on the long term health growth and profitability of our core business we expect a rebound in project sales in 2020 and beyond given our robust project pipeline our focus on new solar module technologies innovative products and premium channels will also help the company maintain its competitive edge in its module and solar system business we will continue to focus on delivering improved results and maximizing shareholder value recent developments on february 15 2019 canadian

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available it is generally possible to take all assets security in australia subject to contractual restrictions and if applicable restrictions under certain statutory licences any security interest in personal property is governed by the personal property securities act 2009 cth ppsa which expressly allows for security interests over all present and future ie after acquired property including proceeds from investments and sale of collateral the ppsa will apply if secured property is located in australia or if the grantor of the security interest is an australian entity however personal property under the ppsa does not include land fixtures and certain statutory rights including mining and petroleum titles water rights gaming licences and liquor licences although these exclusions are on a state by state basis pursuant to state legislation security interests over these assets are generally subject to applicable state or federal legislation collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security perfection of a security interest under australian law is usually relatively simple for most personal property perfection will usually be by way of registration on the personal property security register ppsr which involves an online registration by the secured party security over personal property can also be perfected by the secured party having possession of the secured property for example share certificates and blank transfer forms or other certificates of title or the secured party having control of the property over which the security interest was granted for example the secured bank account is held with the secured party it is common for a ppsr registration to be made even if the secured party has possession or control over the secured property however the following types of collateral may require separate perfection steps certain assets that the ppsa stipulates can be registered by serial number eg motor vehicles and certain intellectual property real property requires registration on the relevant state land titles office and may require the grantor to provide the certificate of title to the property and some asset classes require separate registration on the relevant federal or state register eg statutory licences such as mining tenements and petroleum licences establishing priority in australia is more complex broadly in relation to personal property a perfected interest will take priority over an unperfected security interest and a security interest perfected by control will take priority over security interests perfected by registration or other means where both interests are perfected the security interest that was perfected earlier will have priority where both interests are unperfected the earlier attached security interest will have priority where a financier provides funds to a borrower for the purchase of particular collateral and some amount of the purchase price remains outstanding or the collateral is provided under a lease of more than two years the financier will have a purchase money security interest over the collateral this security interest has super priority over all other security interests for real property and most statutory licences priority is established through registration on the relevant register with first in time registrations having priority and registered interests having priority over unregistered interests no stamp duty is payable to perfect any security interest in australia however registration fees are usually payable in order to perfect a security interest by registration whether on the ppsr a relevant state land authority or other government agency such fees are generally not financially significant usually in australia if security is being granted for the benefit of more than one party security will be granted to a security trustee the security trustee holds the benefit of the security on trust for all beneficiaries of the security including assignees however it is possible instead for security to be granted to a security agent who holds the benefit of the security as an agent for all relevant finance parties the latter method is sometimes used for cross border financings where an australian guarantor guarantees the obligations of a borrower incorporated in a jurisdiction that does not recognise trustee relationships there are no licences required specifically for an entity to act as security trustee or security agent and hold or enforce security over australian assets however holding or enforcing security over australian assets may require foreign investment approvals assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien usually a creditor would check the ppsr and other relevant registries in respect of particular material assets for example land titles or mining tenement registries as well as seeking warranties from relevant security providers while this provides a reasonable degree of protection a creditor cannot comprehensively assure itself that there are no liens over an asset through searches as these will not reveal the presence of unperfected or equitable liens nor will the registry record security interests perfected by possession or control although these should be evident through due diligence generally unperfected liens will rank behind a creditor s perfected lien however common law or statutory liens such as workman s liens while unusual are not subject to the ppsa so may have priority enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral a project lender s ability to enforce the security will be governed by the terms of the relevant security agreement and relevant legislation including the ppsa and the corporations act under the ppsa there are rules governing enforcement of security interests including that notices must be given to a debtor or a higher ranking security holder most rules can be contractually dis applied and it is normal to do so under project financing security agreements also the project lender may elect to enforce the security under the common law framework rather than under the ppsa regime under common law the length of notice before enforcement must be reasonable ie long enough in the particular circumstances of the case to allow the recipient to make the requisite payment notices under mortgages in certain states have statutory time limits as well as other statutory requirements these time limits but not the other requirements can be and generally are contracted out of the project lender will generally have the right to enforce its security by appointing a receiver or taking possession as mortgagee although this right is less commonly exercised other than in respect of real property security further should the project lender hold registered security over all or substantially all of a company s assets it may appoint an administrator there is no requirement for the project lender to obtain a judgment before exercising enforcement rights and the project lender may enforce the security should the security documents permit it to do so the corporations act imposes a duty on receivers and other controllers of the property of a corporation to take all reasonable care to sell the property for not less than its market value or if it does not have a market value when it is sold at the best price that is reasonably obtainable the common law imposes a similar duty on receivers provided a receiver exercises such care it is not required to delay the sale of the secured property on enforcement the sale may be public or private the project lender may participate as a buyer in a sale although in such circumstances should take care to maintain the integrity of the marketing process and sales may be in foreign currency enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement in australia a company that is insolvent or is likely to become insolvent at some future time will often have an administrator appointed to it administration is a statutory process and while an administrator can be appointed by a liquidator or a secured party with security over the whole or substantially the whole of the company s property most commonly it is the board of the relevant company who resolves to appoint an administrator an incentive for directors to appoint an administrator is that the appointment can operate as a defence to a claim against the director personally by creditors liquidators or the regulator of permitting the company to trade while insolvent the appointment of an administrator to an australian company creates a statutory moratorium on creditors rights for the duration of the administration there is a stay on proceedings winding up applications the exercise of third party rights as well as enforcement against property including by a secured project lender however if the project lender holds security over all or substantially all of the company s assets it has a 13 business day decision period after the administration begins in which it can enforce its rights it is common practice for a project lender to seek security over all or substantially all of a project company s assets so it avoids the risk of moratorium on security enforcement during administration if a company is wound up and its assets liquidated unfair preferences and uncommercial transactions can be voided these provisions may extend to secured creditors if a project lender enters into a secured transaction shortly before the project company becomes insolvent unsecured creditors may be able to challenge the security on the basis that the grant of security constituted an unfair preference or uncommercial transaction if successful the project lender will not be able to access the assets the subject of the transaction and the assets will be distributed among all creditors including unsecured creditors unfair preferences are where one creditor is unfairly preferred over others uncommercial transactions are those that do not involve creditors and aim among other matters to capture disposals of property at an undervalue the transactions must have been made while the company is insolvent or the company must have become insolvent as a result of the transaction the transaction must also have been entered into during the period ending on the relation back day but on or before the winding up process began both unfair preferences and uncommercial transactions are voidable for unfair preferences the period is six months for uncommercial transactions two years for transactions involving related parties four years and for transactions entered into to avoid the rights of creditors 10 years this is known as the hardening period as after this date the transaction cannot be voided secured creditors are paid in preference to all unsecured debts and claims other distributions that take priority over unsecured creditors but behind secured creditors are costs of winding up employee entitlements tax liabilities and floating charges there are no relevant entities excluded from bankruptcy proceedings a creditor can usually appoint a receiver to take control of the secured property generally a receiver is entitled to sell the property to realise the debt claims of foreign creditors are treated the same as australian creditors foreign exchange and withholding tax issues restrictions controls fees and taxes what are the restrictions controls fees taxes or other charges on foreign currency exchange there are generally no exchange controls that can prevent repatriation or realisation of proceeds laws in connection with sanctions terrorism or money laundering may restrict or prohibit payments transactions and dealings in certain cases for example the australian transaction reports and analysis centre austrac requires significant cash transactions and international funds transfers of a 10 000 or suspicious transactions to be reported unless the transaction has been specifically exempted investment returns what are the restrictions controls fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions there are generally no restrictions on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions non resident withholding taxes apply to payments of interest royalties and dividends by residents of australia to non residents although parties may commercially agree that the payer will gross up the payment interest withholding tax applies at the rate of 10 per cent to the gross amount of interest paid an exemption from interest withholding tax may be available under australia s domestic tax laws or under the terms of a tax treaty for example there is a commonly used exemption in respect of interest paid on a syndicated loan where the invitation to participate in the syndicated loan facility satisfied the public offer test there are also double tax agreements with many other countries that exempt payments of interest to resident financial institutions as for most jurisdictions there are anti money laundering and counter terrorism financing standards imposed on the financial sector and related industries in australia foreign earnings must project companies repatriate foreign earnings if so must they be converted to local currency and what further restrictions exist over their use there is no requirement for australian project companies to repatriate foreign earnings may project companies establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally yes though these accounts must be declared with the australian tax office foreign investment issues investment restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies do the restrictions also apply to foreign investors or creditors in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies are there any bilateral investment treaties with key nation states or other international treaties that may afford relief from such restrictions would such activities require registration with any government authority there are significant and complex restrictions on foreign ownership of australian companies or assets including mining and petroleum tenements and land approval from the foreign investment review board firb is required for a wide range of transactions if approval is not granted and the transaction proceeds the treasurer has powers to impose penalties or to make an order that the transaction be unwound or that the asset be disposed of whether firb approval is required for a transaction can be a technical question and applying for an approval will often incur significant fees however there is a broad exemption for financiers the restrictions do not apply to acquisitions of entities and land for the purposes of securing payment obligations under a moneylending agreement or on enforcement of that security additional rules apply in respect of security over residential land the financier must be registered as an authorised deposit taking institution ie a bank in australia or licensed outside australia as a financial institution and be listed on a stock exchange or have at least 100 holders of its securities there are also limits on how long a security holder who is a foreign government investor can hold an interest post enforcement of security the firb regime has different thresholds for classes of transaction acquisitions under these thresholds may not require firb approval for agreement countries these thresholds are higher and so capture a wider spread of transactions current agreement countries are chile china japan korea new zealand singapore and the united states there is no need for any particular registration for investors from these countries to take advantage of the higher thresholds however the increased thresholds do not apply where the acquisition is made by a subsidiary incorporated elsewhere the acquirer is a foreign government investor or the target of the acquisition is in a sensitive sector these assessments are complex and should be made on a case by case basis insurance restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies may such policies be payable to foreign secured creditors any person wishing to carry on an insurance business in australia must be authorised by the australian prudential regulation authority whether conducting business directly or through an insurance agent or broker and regardless of whether or not the person or company holds an authorisation in an overseas jurisdiction there is a limited exemption to enable insurance business that cannot be appropriately placed in australia to be provided by an unauthorised foreign insurer products for managing financial risk may be subject to financial services regulation and licensing requirements non resident insurers with no principal office or branch in australia may be taxed on a deemed table income based on gross premium derived under an insurance contract from the insurance of property situated in australia or the insurance of an event that can only happen in australia in certain circumstances the insured person and any person in australia acting on behalf of the insurer can become personally liable to pay this tax worker restrictions what restrictions exist on bringing in foreign workers technicians or executives to work on a project there are a number of restrictions on bringing in foreign workers to work on australian projects foreign workers must hold a valid and appropriate visa to work in australia including on offshore resources projects and are subject to australian employment laws employers can sponsor foreign workers for either temporary or permanent visas significant recent changes have occurred in the temporary visas space the temporary skill shortage tss visa was introduced in march 2018 and abolished the commonly used 457 visa there are two main streams available under the new tss visa programme short term stream this is for employers to source genuine temporary overseas skilled workers in occupations included on the short term skilled occupation list for a maximum of two years or up to four years if an international trade obligation applies medium term stream this is for employers to source highly skilled overseas workers to fill medium term critical skills in occupations included on the medium and long term strategic skills list for up to four years with eligibility to apply for permanent residence after three years temporary visas are available only to workers in a specified list of occupations there are currently 461 occupations eligible in addition employers may first be required to demonstrate they have sought to employ an australian citizen in the role labour market testing will apply to all occupations nominated under the tss visa programme unless an exemption applies under australia s international obligations visa applicants must be under the age of 45 unless an exemption applies clear a criminal records check demonstrate english language proficiency and demonstrate at least three years of relevant work experience under the tss programme employers will be subject to undertake a non discriminatory workforce test to ensure that australian workers are not being actively discriminated against pay minimum australian market salary rate and contribute more towards training australian workers equipment restrictions what restrictions exist on the importation of project equipment australia offers a straightforward and undemanding platform for importation to the country there is no general requirement for an importing entity to hold a licence for importation the import of certain goods may be prohibited or restricted but this is unlikely to be relevant to project equipment the australian border force must clear all goods imported into australia whether they are imported by air sea or post all goods imported with a value of more than a 1 000 must be cleared by submitting a completed import declaration form and paying any duty goods and services tax and other taxes and charges that may apply goods with a value equal to or less than a 1 000 generally do not attract duty or tax any equipment to be used in australia must also comply with australian standards and relevant codes of practice nationalisation laws what laws exist regarding the nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and assets are any forms of investment specially protected australia is a low risk jurisdiction for nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and assets all levels of government in australia may compulsorily acquire land where necessary for certain public purposes they are obliged to pay compensation for the land generally based on the value of the land acquired there has been no nationalisation of project companies in australia in recent history fiscal treatment of foreign investment incentives what tax incentives or other incentives are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors what taxes apply to foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents either for the purposes of effectiveness or registration there are no incentives offered preferentially to foreign investors or creditors in australia generally no stamp duty or other taxes are payable to ensure that a foreign investment loan mortgage or other security interest is effective or registered though registration fees may be payable in some situations stamp duty may be payable if equity is being taken in a company that holds land assets tax may be payable on income and interest dividend and royalty payments made by an australian resident company to a non resident may be subject to withholding tax unless an exemption applies government authorities relevant authorities what are the relevant government agencies or departments with authority over projects in the typical project sectors what is the nature and extent of their authority what is the history of state ownership in these sectors federal and state government agencies will often have shared responsibility for typical project sectors the relationship between federal and state authorities can be complex and will depend upon the jurisdiction sector and sometimes the nature of the particular project usually the relevant state agency will be responsible for infrastructure procurement and minerals extraction although the federal agency will have responsibility for offshore oil and gas projects in commonwealth waters regulation of natural resources titles who has title to natural resources what rights may private parties acquire to these resources and what obligations does the holder have may foreign parties acquire such rights regulation of rights to natural resources varies for each resource class but generally title to natural resources can be acquired by foreign parties subject to foreign investment regulation mining australia s mining industry is largely regulated at a state and territory level with limited overlapping commonwealth regulation at law minerals are with few exceptions owned by the state and state and territory governments authorise companies and individuals to undertake specific mining activities in respect of designated areas exploration tenements authorise exploration activities and typically give a preferential right to apply for a mining tenement which covers extraction and production some jurisdictions also grant retention tenements where a significant resource has been identified but is currently uneconomic to develop retention tenements protect investors in these circumstances from the use it or lose it policy that underpins australia s resources regulation regime mining tenements may be granted for specific minerals or minerals generally they may be granted over public and private land and each jurisdiction specifies a procedure for negotiating access and landowner compensation ministerial consent is required to transfer most types of tenements in western australia state agreements can be an exception to the above regime these are agreements between a developer and a state government for the development of a particular significant resource this agreement sets out the rights and obligations of both parties throughout the project overrides any other resource legislation and is negotiated on a case by case basis a state agreement provides significant certainty to a developer as it can only be amended by mutual agreement between the state and the developer an agreed state agreement demonstrates clear government support for a project oil and gas ownership of hydrocarbons is vested in the commonwealth state or territory governments the right to conduct petroleum activities including exploration and production is acquired through the grant of various licences and approvals from the government authority responsible for administering the applicable legislative regimes once it has been recovered the titleholders own the petroleum and the government s interest in such petroleum is limited to an economic interest in the form of a tax or royalty the commonwealth and each australian state and territory has its own legislative regime for the regulation of upstream petroleum activities the statutory regimes are effectively separated into three distinct geographical areas commonwealth offshore waters beyond the three nautical mile mark to the edge of australia s continental shelf state or territory offshore waters up to the three nautical mile mark and onshore which is governed by the particular state or territory in australia it is not uncommon for offshore petroleum projects to be regulated by petroleum legislation from all three regimes for example where a project involves exploration in the commonwealth offshore area a pipeline could pass through the state offshore area and an onshore processing facility commonwealth upstream petroleum activities in the commonwealth offshore area are principally governed by the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage act 2006 cth the opggsa project proponents are granted rights to conduct petroleum exploration appraisal development and production activities in the commonwealth offshore area under a statutory licensing regime the joint authority comprising of the responsible state minister and commonwealth minister and the national offshore petroleum titles administrator have responsibility for the administration of petroleum tenure under such a licensing regime state each state and territory has its own legislative regime regulating petroleum activities in each of their offshore and onshore areas the types of petroleum tenure established by each of these regimes broadly mirror those contained in the opggsa the relevant state or territory minister is responsible for the grant and administration of this tenure water land grown resources title to water is held by the states and territories state legislation generally provides for the state to grant rights to use water in its jurisdiction these rights may be subject to conditions such as the holder complying with a water management plan the murray darling river system is the most economically important river system in australia and affects new south wales victoria and south australia rights to water from this system are governed by the murray darling basin agreement a complex set of agreements between the states generally rock gravel shale other than oil shale some sands and some clays are not governed by the mining legislation but are administered by local government and can be privately owned land ownership in each state and territory is based on the torrens system of title land is either freehold land or crown land which may be leased or licenced for particular purposes natural products grown on the land are generally property of the owner of the land native title native title describes the land rights of aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples under traditional laws and customs where a project takes place on land affected by native title project participants must follow the procedures of the native title act 1993 cth this may involve compliance with the future acts regime negotiations with native title holders or claimants and in some cases a project may require a more broad ranging indigenous land use agreement before it can proceed projects affecting sites of cultural heritage must follow certain requirements there is the risk of delays if significant areas of cultural heritage are identified royalties and taxes what royalties and taxes are payable on the extraction of natural resources and are they revenue or profit based royalties are generally payable to the relevant state or territory government on the extraction of minerals or the production of petroleum while normally calculated on a gross revenue basis the rates differ between jurisdictions and commodities for example in western australia there are two systems used to collect mineral royalties royalties for low value construction and industrial minerals are generally collected under a specific rate or quality based rate under this rate royalties are calculated on the number of tonnes produced a value based rate of royalty is generally used for other minerals this royalty rate is calculated as a proportion of the royalty value of the mineral the royalty value is broadly calculated as the quality of the mineral in the form in which it is first sold multiplied by the price in that form minus allowable deductions different royalty rates apply for bulk material that has been subject to limited treatment and concentrate material that has been subject to substantial enrichment through a concentration plant and metal further alternative royalty values sometimes apply eg nickel has an alternative value for petroleum western australia has a straightforward royalties arrangement this comprises of a 60 40 revenue sharing arrangement of the 10 per cent royalty rate of the well head value to be shared among the commonwealth and the state respectively any royalty exceeding 10 per cent goes entirely to the state state agreements can specify different royalty rates changing the royalty system for the particular company who has the agreement with the state alternatively state agreements may simply refer to the royalty provisions in the relevant legislation mining and petroleum projects are also subject to industry specific taxes these taxes and royalties operate alongside the general companies taxation regime and liability for one tax may sometimes be offset or deductible against another the petroleum resource rent tax covers offshore and onshore oil and gas projects there is no distinction between royalties and taxes on extraction payable by australian and foreign parties export restrictions what restrictions fees or taxes exist on the export of natural resources there are few limitations on the export of natural resources from australia and no specific export taxes or fees on commodities the western australian government has a domestic gas reservation policy with a target of 15 per cent of production from each export lng project the policy has been applied through conditions on land or petroleum tenure in a state agreement rather than under specific legislation australian export prohibitions or restrictions are designed to ensure quality control administer trade embargoes and meet obligations under international arrangements there are two commonwealth administered mineral export controls these are rough diamonds which may only be exported to countries participating in the kimberley process certification scheme an international effort to eliminate the trade in diamonds used to fund conflict and uranium or related nuclear materials to ensure compliance with australia s non proliferation policy obligations legal issues of general application government permission what government approvals are required for typical project finance transactions what fees and other charges apply no specific government approval is required for typical project financing arrangements including loans and remittances approval may be required to take certain types of security for example security over mining tenements however there is government regulation of common project finance areas such as infrastructure transport aviation water and electricity federal state and territory governments may be involved and the requirements can be complex planning environmental health and safety and native title laws will all apply further approval is required to take an interest in some assets government approval is required for private acquisitions of critical infrastructure registration of financing must any of the financing or project documents be registered or filed with any government authority or otherwise comply with legal formalities to be valid or enforceable there is no need for registration of project documents other than the registration of security interests as described above government authorities will need to approve any contract where the government is a counterparty or any licence granted by the government where taking security requires consent there is no need for documents to be notarised or apostilled arbitration awards how are international arbitration contractual provisions and awards recognised by local courts is the jurisdiction a member of the icsid convention or other prominent dispute resolution conventions are any types of disputes not arbitrable are any types of disputes subject to automatic domestic arbitration arbitral awards are subject to the usual grounds for challenge generally enforceable in australia regardless of the country in which they are made australia is a member of the icsid convention and the new york convention and the uncitral model law has effect in australia if a foreign award meets the conditions of the new york convention and the model law australian courts will generally enforce it however some matters are non arbitrable as a matter of public policy bankruptcy and insolvency matters some intellectual property insurance contracts and competition law are generally non arbitrable all australian states have a version of the model law creating a uniform framework for domestic arbitration no statutory provisions require automatic domestic arbitration australia has a well developed and tried and tested legislative framework that supports the enforceability of arbitral awards produced through arbitration the australian centre for commercial arbitration rules are in line with international best practice law governing agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs project agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs financing agreements which matters are governed by domestic law project agreements and financing agreements are typically governed by australian law occasionally financing agreements for projects are governed by foreign law usually english or new york law security agreements generally are governed by domestic law regardless of the choice of law for the financing facility submission to foreign jurisdiction is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable australian courts generally will give effect to the submission by parties to a foreign law contract to the jurisdiction of the courts of that governing jurisdiction unless there are public policy reasons not to do so the australian courts will draw a distinction between exclusive and non exclusive jurisdiction so it is prudent to draft any jurisdiction clause clearly also certain australian statutes may allow actions in respect of contractual arrangements where the jurisdiction of australian courts is prescribed foreign state immunity is codified in australia in the foreign states immunities act 1985 cth such immunity may be waived by agreement and any such agreement will be generally effective and enforceable environmental health and safety laws applicable regulations what laws or regulations apply to typical project sectors what regulatory bodies administer those laws most major projects require state as well as federal approvals environmental approvals for resources projects are primarily regulated at state level however federal legislation applies where a project is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance there are opportunities to streamline these environmental assessment processes to minimise procedural duplication owing to bilateral agreements in place between state and commonwealth governments depending on the nature of the impacts and location of the project work health and safety legislation applies to all project sectors the legislation is state based but with the exception of victoria and western australia the state legislation was modelled on the national work health and safety whs legislation whs law requires employers or persons conducting a business undertaking to do everything reasonably practicable to ensure the health and safety of workers and other persons at their workplace and any other place that is connected with their business undertaking directors officers and managers also have an ongoing due diligence duty under whs law which requires them to take all reasonably practicable steps to eliminate or minimise health and safety risks in their workplace part of this duty requires them to monitor and assess on an ongoing and continuous basis all risks to health and safety that exist in their particular workplace the resources sector is subject to further industry specific whs legislation for instance the mines safety and inspection act 1994 wa and the accompanying mines safety and inspection regulations 1995 wa apply to mining operations in western australia these laws impose greater duty of care obligations on relevant stakeholders and provide penalties for their breaches with the aim of protecting workers from unsafe environments and hazards project companies principal business structures what are the principal business structures of project companies what are the principal sources of financing available to project companies a company is an attractive business structure because it provides limited liability for its shareholders the most common australian company is a company limited by shares which can be either a proprietary company or a public company trust and partnership structures may be used but are less common project vehicles joint ventures in australia can be either incorporated where the joint venturers come together to form a company or unincorporated which is a common structure for resources projects under an unincorporated joint venture participants hold their interest and entitlements in the project assets separately as tenants in common and a joint venture agreement between the participants governs the project and the participants obligations to each other projects in australia are typically funded by equity and debt many australian project companies are publicly listed on the australian stock exchange which operates the primary securities exchange for australia s strong equity market although others are privately held common sources of debt finance include australian and international banks and private equity firms as well as superannuation and other funds who are increasingly active investors in debt as well as equity in the infrastructure sector australian project companies have also increasingly turned to international and to a lesser extent domestic debt capital markets for financing public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific australia does not have a specific legislative framework for ppps although ppps are regularly used for public infrastructure investment the national ppp policy and guidelines set out the processes that authorities should follow in the investment procurement development and operations stages of ppps along with standard risk allocations and commercial principles to be adopted state governments have their own jurisdictional requirements and departures that are read in conjunction with the national guidelines virtually all categories of public infrastructure either have been or are proposed to be subject to ppp transactions these include transport social infrastructure energy water and telecommunications projects ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions a ppp model can be and has been used for a wide range of projects and services however the relevant level of government will review a ppp business case to ensure that it will deliver the best value for money to the government government policy dictates that generally only transactions above a 50 100 million will be considered for a ppp projects under this value threshold can also be considered if they represent significant value for money some jurisdictions allow projects to be bundled together to meet this value threshold most australian governments also require a public interest public benefit or public policy test when considering a ppp delivery method this usually involves conducting a business case assessment which includes considering the impact of the project on the public especially on those stakeholders identified as being directly affected by the project the national guidelines recommend that project developers liaise with public interest groups and other relevant bodies and consider possible outcomes of a qualitative or quantitative nature that may impact upon the value for money analysis there are no legal restrictions on foreign entities engaging in the ppp process with australian governments apart from building licensing obligations in some jurisdictions many foreign entities have been involved in consortia that have bid for and won australian ppp projects ppp transactions significant transactions what have been the most significant ppp transactions completed to date in your jurisdiction there were a number of significant ppp deals closed in 2017 2018 allens advised the financiers on the a 11 billion melbourne metro rail ppp a project that will transform passenger rail transport in metropolitan melbourne which reached financial close in december 2017 the firm also advised on the long term lease of endeavour energy the third and final energy transmission and distribution network to be privatised in nsw which was granted for a 7 6 billion update trends update trends updates and trends renewables project financings are expected to continue apace in order to meet the federal government s renewable energy target by 2020 aiming for large scale renewable energy generation of 33 000gwh in 2020 wind projects continue to be well represented and there has been a considerable increase in solar farm deals as a result of reduced costs of pv solar and financial support provided by the australian government through the australian renewable energy agency arena as well as state solar offtake schemes the renewables sector has also seen the development of innovative financing structures such as pacific hydro s a 670 million global funding platform which refinanced a portfolio of renewable assets including wind

awareness of who owns what is critical to national security and the u s government knows far less than you think even after congress outlaws completely anonymous companies it will still be difficult for the government to understand patterns of foreign investment particularly when complex structures are used here s how to track and analyze these flows without disrupting business the united states has grown increasingly isolated among major economies in its willingness to allow individuals to form a company anonymously but this could change soon legislation requiring individuals who create a new company to report their identities and ownership stakes to the treasury department seems likely to pass in congress and soon such a measure nearly passed the house financial services committee last year and treasury secretary steven mnuchin has been outspoken in his support for it issues of validating and verifying the ownership information submitted to the government will no doubt dog the program for some time and properly vetting the large volume of submissions will be resource intensive nonetheless maintaining a centralized register of the owners of u s companies and making it accessible to law enforcement and regulators will be a major accomplishment one that will make it more difficult for illicit actors to transfer funds and launder money through an anonymous company however the demise of truly anonymous companies will mark the beginning not the end of the path to financial transparency here are some steps that the government can take to begin to get an accurate sense of foreign investment in the united states and better assess where the greatest risks may lie transparency matters undeclared foreign investments allow malign actors to cultivate political influence gain economic leverage infiltrate the government procurement process and obtain access to and influence over strategic sectors when foreign actors acquire companies that make controlled goods own sensitive personal data or produce military technology there is a tangible threat of sabotage subterfuge theft or surveillance the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius newly enhanced in 2018 oversees a fairly robust albeit imperfect screening process to assess these most acute risks but cfius cannot screen foreign acquisitions about which it is unaware the government does not have a precise sense of how many assets are owned by foreign investors let alone which assets or which investors that is both because investors need not purchase u s assets using a u s company and because simply reporting the owner of a company provides no information about what assets that company bought while the united states should maintain its open investment posture stronger monitoring of foreign asset purchases is essential although pervasive opacity makes it difficult to assess the relative percentage of foreign capital flows that may pose a national security threat or involve illicit activity there are warning signs counterintelligence officials from boston to silicon valley have warned that foreign particularly chinese and russian investment in the tech sector often has non commercial motives including access to data or controlled technology a pilot treasury program to track all cash residential real estate purchases in select cities found that approximately one third of the transactions involved a party that was separately mentioned in a suspicious activity report filed by a financial institution and high concentrations of non resident bank deposits have been correlated with large scale money laundering at banks in cyprus estonia latvia malta and elsewhere a financial transparency agenda driven by national security should comprehensively monitor foreign money entering the united states and it must tackle the four primary ways in which it does so foreign direct investment portfolio investment real estate and bank deposits the four pathways of financial influence and how to increase transparency within them foreign direct investment when a foreign investor buys a u s company outright starts a new one or builds a plant or facility the transaction is classified as a foreign direct investment fdi the commerce department s bureau of economic analysis conducts surveys to track this activity and asks the u s company being acquired to report the nationality of its beneficial owners meaning the individuals who own or control the company making the purchase commerce estimates the total level of fdi at approximately 13 4 trillion the surveys are designed with economics and not national security in mind and they do not attempt to ascertain the identities of foreign investors to remedy this the united states government should improve commerce department surveys of foreign direct investment commerce should attempt to collect the names and identities of foreign direct investors at the beneficial owner level as part of its existing surveys u s government agencies should be allowed to use this information for lawful regulatory or investigative proceedings commerce reporting could also serve as a baseline against which other reporting could be checked require hedge funds private equity funds and venture capital firms to disclose their investors and their positions as soon as possible in practical terms relying solely on commerce department surveys would be insufficient for one thing much foreign direct investment structured through private investment funds is exempt from commerce surveys more fundamentally small and medium sized businesses may have difficulty carrying out sufficient due diligence to verify that the information they receive about their foreign investors is accurate and enforcement of penalties for non compliance would be challenging therefore the u s government s priority with respect to fdi should be the collection of accurate information from hedge funds private equity firms and venture capital firms they are relatively finite in number they are sophisticated and they have compliance capabilities u s based firms hold positions totaling 13 trillion it would be straightforward to require fund managers to disclose to the securities and exchange commission sec which already regulates and examines them both the identities of their investors and the investment positions they hold these fund managers should also be subject to anti money laundering aml program requirements from which they are currently exempt in a second stage collect equivalent information from foreign funds collecting equivalent information from foreign funds including sovereign wealth funds is a bit more complicated but the foreign account tax compliance act offers two workable models fund managers could supply the information directly to the u s government or their domestic supervisors could do so for them the penalty for non compliance could be a fine a surcharge or restrictions or prohibitions on new u s investments the united states would and should be expected to reciprocate portfolio investment the treasury department estimates foreign portfolio investment i e holdings of publicly traded equity or debt in the united states at approximately 19 4 trillion this figure should serve to underscore the scale of this investment although it is at best a ballpark number derived from an annual survey of u s and foreign financial institutions that treasury conducts jointly with the new york federal reserve the survey suffers from custodial bias meaning it often captures the location where u s stocks and bonds are legally held it generally does not identify the securities ultimate owners as a result financial centers such as the cayman islands luxembourg and switzerland are overrepresented in the survey that means that assertions as to the amount of u s government debt owned by china for example are more likely a floor than a ceiling as these estimates would likely miss u s treasuries held outside of china and not self reported by chinese government entities the sec currently has some visibility into the ownership of publicly traded stock the reporting is fairly comprehensive for the holdings of regulated u s institutional investors it also aims to identify every instance in which an investor takes at least a five percent equity stake although the enforceability of that provision on foreign investors is questionable information about bonds and other debt is even scarcer to remedy this the administration should identify the owners of securities such as stocks and bonds there are two ways to find out who america s portfolio investors are and what they own the first is to require custodian institutions that legally hold the securities to obtain this information from their clients who are typically other custodians or broker dealers who would in turn submit additional requests all the way down the chain failure to comply would result in the clients quick dismissal an alternative option is to gather more limited information lightening the burden on u s custodians and exchange it with foreign governments eventually the identity of clients ordering a securities trade should be included in each transaction and made visible to all parties involved as is the standard practice for bank payments bank deposits a high concentration of non resident deposits money held in a domestic bank by a foreign person can signal increased vulnerability to illicit financial activity as demonstrated by recent events in cyprus latvia malta and elsewhere non resident depositors in large enough numbers can both become important funders of a bank s operations and begin to generate enormous fees incentivizing greater risk taking like other central banks the federal reserve breaks down the amount of non resident deposits held by corporates and households in its published statistics however the practice is to report the country in which the legal entity customer is registered rather than the nationality of the beneficial owner thus a russian national who keeps money in a bank account in cyprus in the name of a cypriot company is treated as a domestic rather than a non resident depositor obfuscation is tempting and easy the federal reserve should collect and publish accurate information about non resident deposits based on the nationality of beneficial owners doing so would have two important benefits first it would help u s policymakers and supervisors identify pockets of illicit finance risk building up in the system in a particular institution or geographic area for example second it would help drive international standards compelling other countries to follow suit the information is readily at hand as u s financial institutions are already required to determine the beneficial ownership of legal entity customers it is also available to law enforcement upon request under section 314 a of the usa patriot act the eu is already moving in this direction but much faster as member states are scheduled to establish national bank account registers by 2020 the united states should consider adopting the european model down the road but the most immediate priority is simply measuring the level of foreign money accurately real estate beginning in 2015 investigative journalists began to demonstrate the ubiquity of foreign money pouring into luxury real estate anonymously much of it allegedly tied to corruption or criminal activity at the time the government could not meaningfully estimate the size of the problem for over two years now the treasury department has run a pilot program to prevent anonymous all cash purchases of residential real estate in certain markets treasury collects the information from title insurance companies under geographic targeting orders a temporary measure to require businesses to report additional information about certain transactions in a defined geographic area the program has been a success uncovering a high percentage of purchases linked to suspicious activity it is time for treasury to make it nationwide and permanent make permanent treasury s pilot program to track real estate purchases treasury possesses the authority to require title insurance companies to establish a program to collect verify and report the owners or beneficiaries of entities used to purchase real estate new legislation is unnecessary although it could serve to expedite the process under this approach treasury would abstain from imposing full aml program requirements on realtors at this time although an expansion of these more burdensome requirements to this much larger population of professionals may be warranted at some future date a cost benefit approach the disclosure and reporting program outlined here is designed to achieve meaningful financial transparency at a reasonable burden preserving the united states open investment posture while protecting national security the program would bolster cfius screening support law enforcement and counter intelligence investigations and help policymakers identify areas or sectors of interest to foreign investors which may prompt further study the program should also aid the government s understanding of broader financial dynamics and potential threats to macro economic stability there is no good reason to invite in unlimited sums of opaque foreign money with no ability to monitor it the benefits are negligible and the potential costs enormous recommendations fdi commerce should enhance its existing surveys to identify foreign ownership of specific u s companies at the beneficial ownership level the sec should collect information on u s private investment funds investors and positions portfolio investment treasury and the new york federal reserve should improve treasury international capital system reporting so that foreign holdings of stocks and bonds are reported by beneficial ownership rather than the location of custody real estate treasury should make permanent and nationwide its pilot program requiring title insurance firms to identify and report the owners of entities used to buy residential real estate and it should consider expanding it to cover commercial property non resident bank deposits the federal reserve should track and publish accurate statistics on the level of non resident deposits in the u s banking system at the beneficial ownership level
but even with the regional centers in place eb 5 didn t prove to be a major draw for foreign investors and what interest it did attract was checkered the program s early years were marred by shady foreign actors and widespread malfeasance investigations turned up numerous instances of tax and wire fraud throughout the 1990s with firms providing falsified documents to cover for investors who didn t even have the requisite funds to furnish the loans at one point the program was shuttered entirely the scandals continued despite numerous attempts to bring it above board in the 2000s well into that decade only a fraction of the allotted 10 000 annual visas were being awarded an artist s rendering of the new york wheel serviced by the staten island ferry bill murphy but in 2009 with the world s investment markets under major duress the program underwent an overhaul not aimed at cleaning up its act but relaxing its standards in the wake of the same financial crisis that had washed out bear stearns the basic solvency of the country s major banks was in doubt and it had become nearly impossible to borrow money for large construction and development projects so that year uscis launched a series of changes to the program construction jobs hadn t previously counted toward the 10 jobs per investor threshold now they would be the number of jobs would no longer be counted by the number of w 2s issued but rather by the amount of money spent according to gary friedland a scholar in residence at nyu stern school of business who has testified before congress on the program even the money spent by workers on an eb 5 project on lunch transport and the like would count toward overall job creation and the restrictions on what constituted a high unemployment area were relaxed so much that nearly any district could be stretched to qualify the global financial community finally took notice eb 5 became extremely common after the financial crisis friedland told me and very broad with the rules revised and unemployment spiking anyway virtually every project in the country could be proven as benefiting a high unemployment area effectively lowering the individual investment amount to 500 000 across the board the fact that jobs were being counted by money spent and not jobs created incentivized massive cost overruns and even though eb 5 investment would only constitute a small percentage of the money spent on a particular project frequently between 10 30 percent all the jobs created by that project would count toward the visas
monrovia dr amos c sawyer is reportedly on a government mission to convince some key actors in the international community and liberia s major development partners including the united nations african union ecowas and the united states to step in the country s current economic and political situation liberia s economy is worsening by the day as the liberian dollar continues to depreciate steeply against its u s dollar counterpart the country s second legal tender the exchange rate is now l 163 to us 1 street exchange rate in a recent report the international monetary fund imf put the foreign exchange depreciation at 26 percent noting that it is detrimental to the living standards of the most vulnerable liberians who earn and spend primarily in liberian dollars and threatens the success of the government s pro poor agenda which the development working tool for the government former interim president dr amos c sawyer the country s economic growth also dropped significantly from 4 7 percent as forecast for 2019 to 0 4 percent the effect of such downtrend is already being manifested in the drastic austerity measures being taken by some of the biggest concession companies in the country firestone natural rubber plantation company early this week announced the laying off of 800 employees this number represents 13 percent of the company s workforce firestone is the biggest employer in liberia s private sector after a thorough and strategic review of its current operations in liberia west africa firestone natural rubber company an indirect subsidiary of bridgestone americas inc has announced the difficult decision to reduce its workforce by 13 approximately 800 employees by early second quarter of 2019 at the company s firestone liberia operation headcount reductions will take place throughout the company s operations and include retirements the discontinuation of certain work contracts and redundancies the company said in a statement sime darby and bea mountains in the western part of liberia while mng gold in central liberia are all said to be contemplating on slashing jobs too in a march 12 2019 letter to the minister of labor moses y kollie a copy which frontpageafrica has seen bea mountain stated that it is taking the decision because it no longer needs the existing amount of workforce a decision has been made to redundant some employees of the exploration and construction departments as work programs associated with those departments have come to an end the letter signed by the company s general manager debar w allen states many liberians have been calling on the government to begin an immediate negotiation with firestone stating that failure to do so would have a catastrophic impact on the livelihood of thousands of liberians taking into account the average liberian family size of at least six dependents on one family head even the imf in its report said unless appropriate policies that would promote strong noninflationary growth over the medium term coupled with the commencement of sales of central bank bills supplemented by the introduction of the standing deposit and credit facilities in the interbank market the economic situation will continue to persist frontpageafrica gathered that it is in this regard that president george weah has asked the former chair of the governance commission gc dr sawyer to seek the intervention of the international community to formulate resolutions policies and framework that would get the economy back on track however the opposition political parties believe holding a conference to salvage the economy would be of no essence while finance minister samuel tweah and central bank governor nathaniel patray iii are yet to be prosecuted for allegedly mismanaging the us 25 million which was intended to mop up excess liquidity the presidential investigation team pit in its report on the disbursement of the us 25 million said the technical economic management team which was headed by tweah and patray deviated from the central bank s standard of procedure in the disbursement of the us 25 million this is in consideration of the investigations findings pointing to the conspicuously criminal way the minister of finance and development planning and the central bank governor as chair and co chair of the technical economic management team temt respectively managed the us 25m so called mop up exercise of 2018 however the cbl statement on the direct mopping exercise noted it is important to note that neither the minister of finance and development planning as chairman of the temt hon samuel d tweah nor any member of the temt was ever involved with the direct mopping operations notwithstanding the opposition political parties have planned to stage a nationwide protest if the administration of president george weah refuses to prosecute the pair if these calls are not heeded and some of those directly culpable are left off the hook we will organize a series of mass actions across liberia to express our dissatisfaction and to let president weah and his administration know how liberians are growing impatient by the day we want the artificial hardships imposed by bad governance to end the waves of looting by senior members of this administration while ordinary citizens are struggling to survive must stop said alp chairman theodore momo at the same time mr benoni urey chairman of the four collaborating opposition political parties alternative national congress anc all liberian party alp liberty party lp and unity party up told frontpageafrica in a telephone interview he personally does not support dr sawyer leading the way for a national conference on the unfolding situations in the country or on any political direction for the nation according to him dr sawyer is one of several individuals who should be held responsible for liberia s present woes dr amos claudius sawyer served as president 1990 1994 of the interim government of liberia following the assassination of former president samuel k doe it was during his regime as interim president that liberia s first printed paper currency which was famously known as jj was changed to another which was known in the monrovia areas as liberty during this period liberia had two local currencies the jj which was being used by most of liberia while the liberty was only used in the monrovia areas

summary seng moon s family fled fighting in myanmar s kachin state in 2011 and wound up struggling to survive in a camp for internally displaced people in 2014 when seng moon was 16 and attending fifth grade her sister in law said she knew of a job as a cook in china s neighboring yunnan province seng moon did not want to go but the promised wage was far more than she could make living in the idp camp so her family decided she shouldn t pass it up play video in the car seng moon s sister in law gave her something she said prevented car sickness seng moon fell asleep immediately when i woke up my hands were tied behind my back she said i cried and shouted and asked for help by then seng moon was in china where her sister in law left her with a chinese family after several months her sister in law returned and told her now you have to get married to a chinese man and took her to another house said seng moon my sister in law left me at the home the family took me to a room in that room i was tied up again they locked the door for one or two months each time when the chinese man brought me meals he raped me after two months they dragged me out of the room the father of the chinese man said here is your husband now you are a married couple be nice to each other and build a happy family her husband continued to be abusive seven months later seng moon was pregnant the baby was a boy after he was born seng moon asked to go home the husband replied no one plans to stop you if you want to go back home you can but you can t take my baby seng moon wanted to escape with her son over two years after being trafficked to china she met a kachin woman in the market who gave her 1 000 yuan us 159 to help her return to myanmar later a chinese woman helped her cross the border when human rights watch interviewed seng moon she was back in the idp camp hiding i m afraid she said that the chinese family will try to find me seng moon s story is typical of the 37 trafficking survivors interviewed for this report the most unusual part of her story is that she escaped with her child many other survivors were forced to leave children behind all the survivors we interviewed were trafficked from and managed to return to myanmar s kachin state or the northern part of neighboring shan state most were from families affected by fighting in the area between myanmar government forces and the kachin independence organization kio and its armed wing the kachin independence army kia while the conflict dates to the independence of the union of burma in 1948 the end of a 17 year ceasefire in 2011 resulted in an escalation of hostilities that has caused the mass displacement of over 100 000 kachin and other ethnic minorities the conflict has left many people in kachin and northern shan states struggling to survive their desperation is heightened because the myanmar government has largely blocked humanitarian aid to displaced people especially in areas controlled by the kio displaced people living in camps receive food but often not enough to avoid hunger for example one camp administrator explained that every 45 days families receive a distribution equal to two cups of rice per family member per day plus about 6 per person in cash to cover all other expenses for the 45 days such as oil salt beans and other food items people outside the camps also struggle to cope with lack of employment opportunities low wages barriers to education and economic and social devastation resulting from decades of conflict women often become the sole breadwinners for their families as many men are taking part in the armed conflict desperate to support their families but with few opportunities to do so many feel they have no choice but to seek work in china wages are higher there even when working illegally and jobs are plentiful the border is nearby and easy to pass through with or without travel documents traffickers prey on their desperation there is no system of formal employment recruitment for work in china in kachin and northern shan states but there are networks of friends neighbors acquaintances and relatives offering women and girls relatively lucrative jobs on the other side of the border some of these jobs are real but frequently they are enticements by traffickers planning to sell women and girls as brides into a life of sexual slavery there is a woman shortage on the other side of the border the percentage of the population of china who are women has fallen every year since 1987 the gender gap among the population age 15 to 29 is increasing and is continuing to rise researchers estimate that there are 30 to 40 million missing women in china women who should be alive today but are not due to factors including a preference for boys that leads to sex selective abortion infanticide abandonment of babies and neglect in providing girls with nutrition and medical assistance many of which have been exacerbated by the one child policy china had in place from 1979 to 2015 and china s continuing restrictions on women s reproductive rights play video the gender imbalance is leaving many chinese men without wives by 2030 projections suggest that 25 percent of chinese men in their late 30s will never have married some families are willing to buy a trafficked bride from myanmar and traffickers are eagerly cashing in it is difficult to estimate the total number of women and girls being trafficked from myanmar to china for sale as brides the myanmar human rights commission said data provided to them by immigration authorities showed that 226 women were trafficked to china in 2017 the myanmar department of social welfare provides assistance to between 100 and 200 female trafficking victims returned from china each year but these figures likely represent only a small proportion of the total number of cases no reliable statistics on the total number exist on either side of the border gathering accurate statistics would be difficult as many cases of missing women are never reported many trafficked women and girls are never found and many women and girls who escape may keep their experience secret due to stigma lack of effective responses by law enforcement and lack of services for survivors discourage people from coming forward even when victims and families seek help it is not clear that any institution on either side of the border is systematically tabulating even the number of reported cases the trafficking survivors interviewed for this report were sold for between the equivalent of us 3 000 and 13 000 the families that bought them occasionally seemed to believe that their payment was a dowry for a willing bride but many clearly knew they were participating in trafficking even those who seemed surprised rarely released the woman or girl they had purchased traffickers used deceit to deliver women into sexual slavery most of the women and girls interviewed for this report were recruited by someone they knew and trusted of the 37 survivors interviewed 15 said they were recruited by friends and 12 by an acquaintance one woman was sold by a friend from her bible school another was recruited by a 13 year old girl she knew another 6 were recruited and sold by their own relatives some women and girls said they were drugged on the way and woke up in a locked room others were told after crossing the border that the job they were promised was no longer available but another job was several days journey away unable to communicate due to language barriers and with no money to make their way home many women and girls felt no option but to stay with the person escorting them even in the face of growing unease play video once delivered to their purchasers the reality of having been trafficked became clear most interviewees were initially locked in a room by the family that bought them and raped frequently as the family sought to make them pregnant the survivors said that the families that bought them often seemed more interested in having a baby than a bride many trafficked women and girls tacitly understood and some were explicitly told that once they had a baby they were free to go as long as they left the child or children behind a few were subjected to what they believed were forced fertility treatments some trafficked brides suffered ongoing physical and emotional abuse in addition to sexual slavery others were subjected to forced labor in the home or in the fields belonging to the family holding them captive the trafficked women and girls interviewed said they watched for a chance to escape some waited weeks or months many waited years a few ran to and were helped by the chinese police most made their own escape begging strangers for help searching desperately for someone they could communicate with in a language they understood eight were forced to leave behind children fathered by their buyers often a source of great pain to them back in myanmar they grappled with trauma and in some cases medical complications from the abuse they had suffered the armed conflict and displacement continued in myanmar so they faced the same financial desperation that drove them to china in the first place some sought help in seeking justice and trying to recover custody of or access to their children all struggled in an environment where they faced stigma from their communities and sometimes their families and where very few services existed to help them recover from their ordeal law enforcement officers on both sides of the border including myanmar authorities chinese authorities and the kio made little effort to recover trafficked women and girls families seeking police help to find a missing daughter sister or wife were turned away repeatedly and often told that they would have to pay if they wanted police to act when women and girls escaped and ran to the chinese police they were sometimes jailed for immigration violations rather than being treated as crime victims repatriation of victims to myanmar was done in a chaotic manner that sometimes left survivors stranded or abruptly dumped at the border many survivors feared telling their stories but those who sought justice rarely received it as the people who trafficked them remained free often continuing their trafficking activities when myanmar authorities did make arrests they usually targeted only the initial brokers in myanmar and not the rest of the networks in china police in china almost never to our knowledge arrested people that knowingly bought trafficked brides and abused them victims were sometimes discouraged by family and friends from seeking justice in the kio controlled areas traffickers were sometimes punished with nothing more than a reprimand the police in myanmar china and kio controlled areas made little effort to coordinate with each other or make these cases a priority play video the women and girls who left children in china had no prospect of getting their children back some were so desperate to be with their children that they chose to go back to the families that had held them as slaves human rights watch was aware of one woman who tried to go back but she was turned away by chinese immigration officials and has never seen her child again the armed conflict in kachin and northern shan states has largely escaped international attention despite 2018 findings by the united nations that the myanmar military has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity there the atrocities against the rohingya people in rakhine state deservedly seized headlines but the women and girls of kachin and northern shan states remain largely invisible victims too many of them are trapped by the collision of war and displacement in myanmar and the fallout from the destructive denial of women s reproductive rights in china in lives of unspeakable abuse key recommendations myanmar and china should improve implementation of agreements to provide effective and coordinated anti trafficking prevention law enforcement and assistance to victims collaborate in developing formalized and government monitored recruitment pathways for people from myanmar including kachin and northern shan states to legally obtain employment in china and safely travel there collaborate in strengthening efforts at and near the border to raise awareness of the risk of trafficking detect trafficking assist victims and potential victims and maintain a shared watchlist of suspected traffickers myanmar and the kio should develop and implement effective public awareness campaigns to inform people in high risk areas such as idp camps and those crossing the border or applying for travel documents of the risk of trafficking and measures to protect themselves provide comprehensive services to trafficking survivors china should end the practice of jailing trafficking survivors for immigration violations and assist their return to myanmar facilitate their safe return to china to assist in investigation and prosecution of crimes committed against them international donors and organizations should urge the myanmar and chinese governments and the kio to do more to tackle bride trafficking enhance services for trafficking victims by supporting nongovernmental organizations experienced in this work in both government and kio controlled areas full recommendations can be found at the end of the report methodology this report is primarily based on interviews with 73 people including 37 ethnic kachin women and girls who escaped back to myanmar after being trafficked and sold as brides in china some survivors escaped only weeks before we interviewed them twenty four of the 37 were trafficked in 2010 or later the most recent cases involved trafficking in 2016 and 2017 an additional 12 interviewees were trafficked between 2002 and 2009 the earliest trafficking experience described by a survivor we interviewed occurred in 1986 our research in myanmar took place during eight months from may 2016 through december 2018 twenty two of the survivors interviewed had been held in china for a year or longer 11 were held for three years or longer the longest time in captivity was nine years twelve interviewees were under age 18 when they were trafficked the youngest was 14 the others were ages 18 to 46 two interviewees were trafficked twice for figures in this report we have used data from the most recent trafficking incident many survivors told us they concealed their experience from their community and sometimes from their families to protect their privacy all names of survivors and family members in this report are pseudonyms and we have omitted details that might make them identifiable interviews with survivors were conducted in private through an interpreter in the kachin language they were conducted with only the interviewee one or two researchers and an interpreter present with the exception of a survivor who wanted her mother present human rights watch sought to avoid re traumatization by using specialized methods for interviewing survivors of trauma one interview with a survivor was conducted by phone all other survivor and family interviews were conducted in person we advised all prospective interviewees of the purpose of this research and how the information would be used they were advised that they could refuse to participate to decline to answer any question or discuss any topic and to end the interview at any time interviewees did not receive any compensation human rights watch paid for the costs in situations where interviewees travelled or incurred phone charges in order to be interviewed we also conducted interviews with three families of women believed or known to have been trafficked and 33 interviews in myanmar with individuals who included representatives of the myanmar ministry of social welfare the myanmar human rights commission the kachin independence organization the kachin women s association and un and other international organizations as well as police lawyers foreign diplomats and nongovernmental organization ngo staff members these interviews were conducted in english or in kachin or burmese with an interpreter human rights watch requested by phone and email an opportunity to interview the myanmar police and the ministry of home affairs but did not receive a response we requested data from the myanmar police through the ministry of social welfare which agreed to convey the request the ministry of social welfare provided some of the data human rights watch requested regarding that ministry s own work but did not provide the requested data regarding police activities in january 2019 we wrote to china s minister of public security with copies to the president of the all women s federation of china and the head of public security for yunnan province our letter included as annex i outlined the findings of this report and requested a response and data from the chinese government as of the date of publication we had not received a response at the time of the research the exchange rates were 1 332 myanmar kyat us 1 and 6 28 chinese yuan us 1 we have used these rates for conversions in the text terminology we use the term trafficking as defined by the un trafficking protocol the recruitment transportation transfer harbouring or receipt of persons by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion of abduction of fraud of deception of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payment or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation interviewees for this report often referred to people involved in trafficking them as recruiters and brokers as well as traffickers our research suggests that most of these individuals knowingly participated in trafficking almost none of the trafficking survivors we interviewed legally married the man they were sold to but they were typically referred to by traffickers and the families who bought them as wives and often referred to themselves this way we have placed the terms bride husband and related terms in quotation marks in some places to emphasize that these terms do not describe the legal nature of the relationship but in other places left them without quotation marks for ease of reading and to respect interviewees voices background the accounts of trafficking survivors highlight the crisis for women and girls in myanmar s kachin and northern shan states the long running and recently escalated conflict in the region has created financial desperation for many ethnic kachin families including those displaced since 2011 by the fighting driving many to seek work in china on the china side the one child policy coupled with a longstanding preference for boys helped create a large and growing shortage of women for marriage and motherhood a porous border and lack of response by law enforcement agencies on both sides created an environment in which traffickers flourish abducting kachin women and girls and selling them in china as brides with near impunity war displacement and desperation in myanmar political and ethnic disputes in myanmar date back before independence from great britain in 1948 and armed conflicts between the national government and ethnic armed groups have occurred throughout myanmar s statehood while ceasefire agreements are now in effect in most of the country s ethnic areas several conflicts persist exacerbated by nearly 50 years of abusive military rule including in kachin state where the kachin have been living with armed conflict for at least 40 of the last 57 years the kachin independence organization kio headquartered in laiza governs considerable swathes of territory acting as a parallel state with departments of health education justice and relief and development among other civic programs its armed wing the kachin independence army kia has become one of myanmar s largest non state ethnic armed groups several other ethnic armed groups are also active in kachin and northern shan states kachin and northern shan states have been a fierce battleground the myanmar armed forces officially known as the tatmadaw and the kia have committed serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law the laws of war the tatmadaw has committed attacks on civilians and their villages summary executions rape torture forced portering and destruction of property it has forcibly relocated large numbers of kachin civilians to government controlled territory the kia has engaged in forced recruitment and use of child soldiers many of these abuses continue to the present a 2018 un fact finding mission found the tatmadaw committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in kachin and shan states as well as serious crimes in rakhine state in western myanmar these included murder imprisonment enforced disappearance torture rape sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence persecution and enslavement the fact finding mission also found evidence of international humanitarian law violations and human rights abuses by ethnic armed groups including abduction and detention ill treatment and destruction or appropriation of civilian land and property there have been instances where these groups have failed to take precautionary measures to protect civilians in attacks and forcibly recruited adults and children the conflict has caused long term mass displacement by 1994 an estimated 84 000 kachin had been displaced either internally or became refugees in china and india a 1994 ceasefire reduced the fighting and recognized kio political autonomy over part of kachin state but in 2008 myanmar s military government announced that all armed groups operating under ceasefire agreements would have to submit to the direct control of the myanmar army the kio rejected the order and in 2009 began recruiting additional forces a series of incidents in 2010 escalated tensions and in june 2011 the tatmadaw began a major offensive in kachin state ending the 17 year ceasefire with the kia the 2011 offensive and subsequent counter insurgency operations since then were brutally executed the myanmar army attacked kachin villages razed homes pillaged properties and forced the displacement of tens of thousands of people soldiers threatened and tortured civilians during interrogations and raped women the army used antipersonnel mines and conscripted laborers including children as young as 14 on the front lines since 2016 the conflict has escalated with thousands of additional people displaced the military s offensive in early 2018 left many civilians trapped displaced and without adequate humanitarian assistance as of september 2018 the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha reported there were 98 000 internally displaced people housed in 139 sites in kachin state 75 percent of them women and children in shan state there were 8 500 idps 77 percent of them women and children located in 31 sites all in the northern part of the state refugees have also fled into china where they experienced lack of adequate shelter food potable water sanitation basic health care and education some refugees have been refused entry at china s border while local chinese officials allegedly on the orders of central authorities forced others back to conflict areas in myanmar a women shortage in china china has a large and growing gap between the numbers of women and men driven by gender discrimination and exacerbated by the one child policy imposed by the government from 1979 to 2015 this gap has created a severe bride shortage among the age group most likely to be looking for a spouse the sex ratio cannot be determined with precision because of a lack of information as well as other factors including families concealment of births in an effort to circumvent the one child policy but according to the chinese government s 2000 census in the period from 1996 to 2000 over 120 boys were born for every 100 girls a group that would now be 19 to 23 years old according to the world health organization a normal ratio at birth is about 105 men to 100 women world bank data shows the percentage of china s population who are female has fallen every year since 1987 as china s population is growing any imbalance in the gender ratio at birth will cause the disparity in the number of women versus men to continue to widen researchers estimate that there are 30 to 40 million missing women in china women who should be alive today but are not due to factors related to preferences for boys including sex selective abortion infanticide abandonment of babies and neglect in providing girls nutrition and medical assistance this sex imbalance has obvious implications for marriage opportunities among chinese men the gender gap within the age range where people are most likely to marry is continuing to rise the minimum legal age of marriage in china is 20 for women and 22 for men and the average age at first marriage in 26 years old in the 20 to 39 years old age range there are already 17 million more men than women by 2030 that gap will grow to over 22 million by 2030 projections suggest that 25 percent of chinese men in their late 30s will never have married given this imbalance women choosing to marry and their families may be more selective about potential grooms opting against men who are poorer and less educated the families that bought the women and girls interviewed for this report tended to be relatively poor and rural and often agricultural workers how many brides are trafficked from myanmar to china it is very difficult to estimate the total number of women and girls being trafficked from myanmar to china for sale as brides the figures available almost certainly dramatically undercount the number of women and girls who are being trafficked a myanmar government official acknowledged this telling human rights watch we have very little information about total numbers she said the government has data on the number of people who contact a government information center about the issue but that figure is just the tip of the iceberg government oversight of conflict affected areas of myanmar is very weak and kio controlled areas are inaccessible to government officials and police it is likely that trafficking is most prevalent in the communities closest to the border and these are the areas in which most kio controlled areas and kio run idp camps are located these factors make it inevitable that figures regarding the numbers of cases handled by the government will provide only a very partial window into the scale of the problem some data is available regarding the number of cases handled by the myanmar government in august 2018 the myanmar anti trafficking police reported that in the first seven months of 2018 they handled 130 trafficking cases 96 of which involved women sold into forced marriage in china the locations with the highest number of cases in order were equal numbers in yangon region and shan state followed by mandalay region and the kachin state a total of 48 cases came from shan and kachin states in 2015 the myanmar government reported to the un that between 2008 and 2013 the government had imposed punishment in 820 trafficking cases and of those cases 534 were forced marriage cases and 599 involved trafficking to china the myanmar national human rights commission mnhrc said data provided to them by immigration authorities showed that 226 women were trafficked to china in 2017 the myanmar department of social welfare provided the following table and data to human rights watch in response to a request for the number of female trafficking victims repatriated to myanmar from china for each year from 2010 through 2017 sr no year number reaccepted total below 18 years above 18 years 1 2010 29 135 164 2 2011 16 122 138 3 2012 26 127 153 4 2013 17 122 139 5 2014 15 119 134 6 2015 18 82 100 7 2016 25 81 106 8 2017 39 142 181 total 185 930 1115 these figures almost certainly represent only a small proportion of the total number of women and girls trafficked even from government controlled areas to china as brides no reliable statistics on the total number exist and gathering such statistics accurately is difficult as many cases are never reported many trafficked women and girls are never found and many women and girls keep their experience secret due to fear of stigma in the communities they return to in myanmar the lack of effective responses by law enforcement and lack of services for survivors and families discourage people from coming forward even when victims and families seek help it is not clear that any institution on either side of the border is systematically capturing the number of reported cases it is also difficult to quantify the problem from the china side of the border the un action for cooperation against trafficking in persons un act writes in reference to china the clandestine nature of these crimes and the fact that only a small minority of cases are reported to the police as incidences of trafficking make it difficult to understand the true scale of china s trafficking problem anti trafficking responses are limited by the current limited legal definition of human trafficking the lack of primary research and data collection the nascent victim protection services available and the limited understanding of the broader trafficking patterns human rights watch s research suggests the number of women and girls being trafficked is substantial and possibly growing an activist working on trafficking cases in myitkyina the capital of kachin state where the population of the township is about 307 000 estimated that 28 to 35 women and girls are trafficked each year from the city a kio official said from 2000 through 2009 the kio dealt with 20 to 30 cases of bride trafficking each year in the laiza area bordering china but that number had increased due to escalating conflict and displacement a worker with the kio affiliated kachin women s association kwa which assists trafficking victims said in four townships in northern shan state that border china about 12 or 13 bride trafficking victims seek help from the kwa each year she estimated another 30 to 40 cases occur in the area in which victims do not seek help the number has been increasing it has been increasing every year she said adding that in 2011 they saw only two to three cases a year she said she knew of traffickers taking groups of six or seven women and girls at a time another kwa worker in eastern kachin state said in 2017 they helped recover four trafficked girls they received requests for help from 10 more victims but were unable to assist due to lack of resources sometimes we hear about trafficking cases but we have no money or top up cards so we just feel sad and cry she said most interviewees for this report knew other victims two survivors had sisters who had also been trafficked as brides two interviewees were mother and daughter trafficked several years apart five interviewees were trafficked with a friend or relative several more were trafficked with strangers including a 16 year old who was transported in a group with five other women and girls from kachin state one woman escaped back to myanmar and married a man whose first wife had been trafficked journeys of trafficked brides between myanmar and china four days later we arrived in fugan then i was locked up in the room i was not allowed to use the phone for a week i cried i ate nothing all i could do was pray after that i realized that i had no way to choose anymore i was there for four years nang shayi trafficked at 18 had two children in china she escaped with her daughter but was forced to leave her son behind desperation in kachin and northern shan states the renewed fighting in kachin and northern shan states has left many people struggling from day to day to survive displaced people living in idp camps receive rations but often not enough to avoid hunger an idp camp administrator from a nongovernment controlled area said that in his camp families receive every 45 days a distribution of rice equal to two cups of rice per person per day plus 7 500 kyat per person us 5 63 in cash to meet all other expenses for the 45 days such as oil salt beans and other food items in other camps food distribution is sometimes per family not per individual leaving people with large families particularly short of food despair among long term displaced people has also contributed to mental health problems and substance use people living outside the camps also struggle to cope with the lack of employment opportunities low wages barriers to education and the economic and social devastation created by decades of conflict women are often the wage earners for their families as many men are engaged in the conflict there is no education no one has support a kwa worker said those living in the camps are without money or anything not being able to make ends meet it is women and girls who pay the price displacement in camps may make women and girls more accessible to traffickers a kachin activist said normally the target is the family who are facing financial crisis in the previous time it was like this but now the are targeting the idp camps it s a better place to gather people they are in one space most of the brokers are involved as relatives or acquaintances a kwa worker herself a displaced person explained the connection between trafficking and the conflict suddenly in 2011 fighting broke out we had to run away and escape for our lives in the past we just left for a short time we thought once the myanmar army stopped firing we could go back but we never could go back and slowly we had to move to the border area because the myanmar army targeted the civilian population then chinese traffickers started coming here to persuade the civilians thought they would take any risk if it would help their family help their younger siblings displacement and economic desperation many interviewees were directly affected by the armed conflict several had relatives killed or injured in the fighting many more described losing their homes livelihoods and possessions and being displaced ja tawng trafficked in 2015 said e lost everything we had we had to leave everything when we ran from our village i became separated from my husband i stayed in the jungle and hid there with my babies when my babies became hungry i had to check the conditions outside the jungle if it seemed stable i would sneak out and go to the sugarcane field to find food for them ja tawng found her husband and they settled in an abandoned house that seemed safe but after staying there for a while the jet fighters came they shot everything they could see they shot for four or five days and they started from the early morning from seven or eight a m they shot villagers and whomever they saw they didn t care all the villagers had to run and hide all the villagers fled the kids had to hide under rocks my children and i hid in banana fields the road was very muddy so the kids cried out a lot they lost their shoes in the muddy road the jet fighters missiles almost hit us but we got away the family moved from place to place seeking safety after several weeks of this a friend said she could get ja tawng work in china in a sugarcane field ja tawng went bringing her two children they were trafficked twice together with displacement came loss of livelihoods the village was in the middle of the fighting said tsin tsin describing events in 2011 there was shelling from both sides we just ran with nothing they burned all the houses the stayed with relatives for a month and then found a tent where they remained for two years tsin tsin had run a grocery store in the village but lost her livelihood when the family was displaced desperate to get her two children back in school she gratefully accepted when another displaced woman offered work on a banana farm in china the woman sold her once displaced families cannot return including because of the widespread presence of landmines on the myanmar side of the border and work is hard to find for people living in camps seng ja ngai a mother of five was trafficked in 2014 at age 35 in 2011 the fighting came the military burned the house and destroyed everything we owned when the civil war came to our village i assumed it would not last too long that s why we carried as much as we could leaving everything else behind since then we never dared to go back from the kio side they make some mines and maybe the military also laid mines for a trap so no one can guarantee our security going back we don t know how long the civil war will go on her family struggled in the idp camp we had no car or motorbike so we could not go out anywhere the ngo gave us rations but it was not enough for us because i have five children seng ja ngai said she was trapped needing transportation to find work needing work to pay for transportation the only work she could find was day labor paving a road near the camp but at 50 yuan per day 8 it left her still struggling to survive day to day a friend offered her work in china and sold her many survivors interviewed for this report were the primary wage earners for their families moon ja was trafficked in 2013 at age 27 her family was displaced to a camp in 2011 i was the breadwinner of my family i took care of my mother and i had to look after her so to live in the idp camp the place is too small and everything is difficult so one of my friends told me in china there are jobs and good salaries every month you can get 4 000 to 5 000 yuan the idp camps can be very crowded because of lack of space camps often restrict how long a person can be away without losing their place this heightens vulnerability by pressuring families to split up khawng shawng and her husband decided one of them would have to go to china while the other stayed behind to keep their space when a chinese couple came to the camp saying they needed a female cook for their construction company and promising wages of 1 500 yuan a month 240 khawng shawng packed her things and left with them within two hours they then sold her for 20 000 yuan 3 200 in june 2018 the myanmar ministry of social welfare relief and resettlement announced plans to close idp camps in kachin karen shan and rakhine states the ministry said it was developing a strategy for closing the camps and would begin closures after the strategy was adopted the announcement provoked fear among many displaced people who worried that they would be forced out with nowhere to go in addition to the conflict and difficult economic situation in kachin and northern shan states some trafficking survivors interviewed had faced additional problems several were orphans grew up in abusive homes or had faced domestic violence or abandonment these factors left some more vulnerable to trafficking ja htoi tsawm travelled to china often to do agricultural work for a few weeks or months at a time to support her four children after her husband a drug user abandoned the family on a trip there in 2013 at age 29 she was trafficked by a woman she befriended as they worked together in a sugarcane field she was held captive for two years while she was gone her in laws sold her house and took the money they put one of her children in an orphanage and another of her children died while she was away school costs and other barriers to education barriers to education drive some girls to china according to the united nations nearly one third of myanmar s children are not enrolled in school and only 16 percent of emergency affected adolescents in kachin and shan states are currently attending post primary education in large part due to the lack of access to free secondary education within idp camps in families short on money prohibitive school fees and costs combined with discriminatory gender roles may mean boys education is prioritized over girls tenth and eleventh grades are especially expensive driving many girls out there s no money to continue their education so girls leave and go to china a kwa worker said the root cause is the political situation said khawng shawng 39 and a mother of two who was trafficked in 2011 khawng shawng s children were ages 5 and 10 months at the time of the interview her five year old daughter had been attending kindergarten in the idp camp where the family lived but in december the myanmar army shelled the camp khawng shawng said school was closed because of the shelling she added because of politics there is no peace in our country people cannot do their own development when i was young my family was rich and we didn t have to worry but one day the myanmar army came and we lost everything my parents really wanted us to be educated but we didn t have the chance because of the conflict it s the same now we want to educate our children but we can t i hope for a democratic government that can develop the country seng ja htoi said she left school and went to china where she was trafficked because while as an idp she was eligible to study for free through ninth grade she was unable to pay 1 300 000 kyat 980 for the tuition necessary to pass the tenth grade exam this is why most kachin young people leave education after grade 10 she explained several girls went to china seeking money for education at that time it was the summer holiday so i assumed that if i worked for a few months then i could make more money and pay my school fee said nang shayi trafficked at age 18 in our family it was a hard time that s why i decided to go to china nang shayi went with a woman from the same village who was known and trusted by her family the woman sold nang shayi for 20 000 yuan 3 200 and she was held for four years several survivors interviewed were the eldest children in their family and expected to help support their families financially including by paying for younger siblings to study pan pan tsawm was one of seven children in a family living in an idp camp i am the eldest sibling so i wanted to earn money for them so i decided to go to china she said my mother accepted the idea and she trusted my friend and thought i could believe her and thought that if i could support my siblings this would be a good way she was 15 when her friend drugged and sold her she was held for three years and left behind a daughter when she escaped the lure of employment or a better life in china on the china side of the border with kachin and northern shan states there appears to be a demand for workers from myanmar in sectors including agriculture and services the shared ethnic identity of some groups in china and myanmar creates greater comfort for some of myanmar s ethnic minority citizens in travelling to china and there is a significant flow of workers many female travelling from myanmar to china for legitimate employment opportunities which even for people without legal authorization to work are more readily available and pay better than in kachin or northern shan states some survivors interviewed worked in china prior to being trafficked and several worked there after being trafficked some workers cross the border daily others go for weeks or months at a time when opportunities arise and economic need dictates most interviewees were recruited by people promising lucrative work in china i believed her and thought i was so lucky seng ja ban said about the woman who offered to pay her travel and food expenses on the way to a restaurant job across the border the woman sold seng ja ban who was held for five years before escaping without her child a 13 year old girl recruited seng ja aung at age 20 the girl who was chinese often visited seng ja aung s idp camp her mother and stepfather lived there she offered to find seng ja aung work i imagined i could get a good job working in some kind of shop seng ja aung said she just said there are many jobs in the shop in another shop in a restaurant arranged everything from the camp to get to china on the way we had to take a motorbike we had to take cars all arranged by that girl the girl delivered seng ja aung to a man who tried to sell her seng ja aung escaped before being sold false promises often from relatives and friends survivors interviewed were usually recruited by someone they trusted six said they were sold by their own relatives the mother of a woman trafficked by her cousin seven years earlier who never made it home told human rights watch in the past i never thought that a relative could do such a crime the broker was my auntie said seng ing nu trafficked at age 17 or 18 she persuaded me seng ing nu travelled to china with her aunt her aunt s friend and a chinese man i didn t understand the relationship between my auntie and the chinese man she said the four travelled to what turned out to be the chinese man s family home and seng ing nu s aunt left her there the man had bought her it took her three years to escape a few women and girls traveled to china to visit family or vacation and were trafficked sometimes by those who invited them one woman and her cousin were working on the myanmar side of the border when they were drugged and woke up in china another was sold by her three cousins after going to visit them a number of interviewees travelled to china without telling their families because their families would not have approved htoi moon ja was 16 when family friends invited to vacation in china with them she happily agreed fighting was happening near her village her mother had died and she and two siblings were staying with their teacher in the village there more people who are poor and only chinese from myanmar they have satellite they have the dish htoi moon ja said i knew that china is a good place the couple sold her nang seng ja at age 20 travelled to china with her aunt to visit family while at her cousin s house she said she was drugged and woke up in a chinese man s house the man said she had been unconscious for five days and she believes he raped her while she was unconscious she managed to flee and make it to a police station but the police accepted a bribe of 5 000 yuan 800 to return her to the family they then locked her in a room where her husband raped her daily four of the survivors described the person who recruited them as a near stranger or someone they only knew as a potential employer or employment broker fifteen were recruited by friends and 12 by acquaintances often from their village or idp camp one young woman was recruited by a friend from bible school several brokers were also trafficking survivors the traffickers are often trafficked themselves and then recruit others an ngo worker explained a burmese woman whom seng ja ngai met in china told seng ja ngai she had been trafficked twice and had been promised 1 000 yuan 160 if she found a buyer for seng ja ngai it is common in kachin communities for a groom s family to pay a dowry to the bride s family at the time of marriage this practice is sometimes exploited by traffickers who give dowry to purchase a woman or girl in a manner that may appear to her and her family to be legal and binding parents are very ignorant and poor a kachin activist said traffickers say they will give the dowry to the mother there is a very long history of this it is giving respect to the mother and father s side you have to give precious things the chinese brokers says we love your daughter and we will pay she said brokers often give about 10 000 yuan 1 600 then resell the girl for 30 000 or 50 000 yuan 4 800 or 8 000 the parents don t know that traffickers are using our customs and traditions a porous border significant portions of myanmar s border along kachin and northern shan states with china are controlled by the kio not the myanmar government as a result border control is haphazard or non existent border security in the region is further complicated by trafficking in the jade and timber trades which are themselves marked by corruption almost all the trafficking survivors interviewed were recruited in myanmar and escorted to china by a person implicated in trafficking the movement of these women and girls across the border was facilitated by loose border controls some women and girls were trafficked through official border posts with guards failing to detect trafficking or perhaps aiding and abetting the crime but most skipped immigration formalities crossing the border without appropriate papers is not difficult there are many ways to cross the border an activist said at the checkpoints there are officers checking but behind the office she said that people cross illegally during hours when the police checkpoint is functioning within sight of the border guards who make no attempt to stop them others go early we know what time there is no border guard so we chose that time very early 6 a m said tsin tsin there are no guards on either side then in the day there are kio soldiers on the myanmar side sometimes they check the red book sometimes they don t you need to get permission from the kio but if you go at 6 a m you don t need permission htoi moon ja trafficked at age 16 travelled from myanmar to china with her traffickers via a gate where boats cross the border without going through formalities several interviewees described an area where drug users carry people across the river for 10 yuan 1 59 a kio official explained laiza in china and laiza in myanmar are like one village it s only to go further to mainland china that you need a passport this area of the border is also the site of extensive trafficking of timber and jade which takes advantage of and contributes to the lawless environment there are lots of illegal logging trucks crossing the border there khawng shawng trafficked in 2011 said of the border area near her idp camp it is very easy to pass illegally there an escorted journey survivors interviewed usually said they were recruited by a trafficker in myanmar and escorted to china they often described a chaotic voyage where they did not know where they were were made helpless by language barriers had no means to pay their own way home and felt swept along by events they did not understand the journeys often involved a sequence of cars and buses over several days and nights sometimes while the victim was drugged some survivors thought traffickers might have complicated the journey intentionally to confuse them and prevent them from finding their way home some survivors said they were kept in hotels a few said they screamed for help but no one came leading them to believe that hotel staff were paid or convinced to ignore them several interviewees said traffickers took their identification documents the woman who trafficked seng ja ban took her myanmar id card as soon as they crossed into china the broker told me there would be no need to use it in china and if someone found it they would know we were illegal seng ja ban said so that s why she took the id card trafficked women and girls were often handed from one trafficker to another a kio official who had worked in anti trafficking said the brokers from are sub brokers not the main broker they get a percentage of the price the main broker is in yingjiang there is a group a broker in myanmar one in yingjiang one in china he added the myanmar broker gives them to the china broker the china broker provides a place to stay and food and shows them to a chinese man and he looks and pays depending on how pretty one hundred thousand yuan or 70 thousand or 50 30 20 depending on how pretty it s like trading jade if jade is a good quality we make a call and trade from one broker to another same thing with a girl traded from one broker to another many women and girls were promised a job close to the border but told after reaching china that that job was no longer available and but another was further into china brokers usually say the job is in yingjiang an activist said a town that is just across the border they are moved from very close to the farthest area and then they disappear said a kwa worker some girls are told we have to move to somewhere that pays more money and they don t even realize drugging of victims eleven of the trafficking survivors interviewed said that they were drugged by traffickers at 14 nang nu tsawm one of eight children needed money to fund her studies a shan woman offered her work in a clothing store in myanmar near the border paying 50 000 kyat 38 per month nang nu tsawm and her cousin 19 went to work there after a week there i fainted i think maybe they gave me some medicine or something i don t remember what happened when i woke up i heard the train and recognized that i was on the train i don t know how many days i had fainted or how long i was on the train i saw only the chinese letters i could not read them there were no myanmar letters i started crying i saw a woman maybe she was a broker i never met whoever it was who brought me on the train she pinched my face she was a shan chinese woman she could speak burmese it was me my cousin and the woman nang nu tsawm s cousin had also fainted nang nu tsawm was sold and held in china about seven years several women and girls were drugged on the pretext of being given medicine for car sickness she offered me a pill for dizziness seng khawn said about the friend who trafficked her after that i do not remember what happened to me ja htoi tsawm woke up locked in a room her clothing was with her but her passport and money were gone the room was in the home of a family she had been sold to she escaped two years later others believed traffickers put drugs in their food or drink htoi nu ja then 36 was promised work in myitkyina she went there bringing her 2 year old son with two acquaintances we arrived in myitkyina bus station she said they asked me if i was hungry and i said yes we tried some noodles and coffee and then i don t remember what happened i fainted she was forcibly taken to china separated from her child and sold she eventually escaped and managed to reclaim her son paralyzed by the language barrier very few of the survivors interviewed could speak understand or read mandarin they described a complete loss of their ability to communicate the moment they crossed the border the language barrier often left trafficked women and girls feeling unable to escape even when in a public place or on public transport while held by chinese families women and girls struggled to communicate making it harder for them to gain empathy or negotiate for their safety or release pan pan tsawm trafficked at 15 was drugged by a friend and woke up in a locked room in a family s house i thought they were my boss because my friends promised to find me a job i thought i was going to work in their business she said i cannot speak chinese we communicated using sign language pan pan tsawm s new husband explained three days later in sign language that he had bought her and then he raped her many had no idea where in china they were even as years passed which meant even if they managed to contact family or friends they could not help would be rescuers find them women who sought help from strangers struggled to communicate those who made it to the police encountered officials who could not understand them and generally did not have access to interpreters you have been grabbed by this family victims realize they have been trafficked every trafficking survivor described a moment when the reality that their voyage to china had gone horribly wrong became undeniable for some it was as abrupt as being drugged and waking up in a locked room for others it was a creeping sense of unease some brokers used deception to hand over victims to buyers a trafficker told mai nu 18 that she had to stay with a family so they could register her with the government to make it legal for her to stay and that an employer would pick her up soon after several days mai nu became anxious the chinese family brought a myanmar woman to speak to her she said why are you not talking your mother in law is concerned that you are not talking mai nu asked who is mother in law i do not know who is that mother in law the interpreter said you have been brought in this family for marriage ou will not easily go home now you have been grabbed by this family you are to marry and you will be here and you will stay here mai nu called the friend who promised her work in a restaurant she said she was told she now had a different type of job with a family the friend then stopped answering mai nu s calls other traffickers used threats to stop trafficking victims from resisting nang nu tsawm said at 14 she and her cousin 19 were drugged and abducted they awoke on a train with a woman who took them to hunan province we stayed in a hotel nang nu tsawm said when we arrived the shan chinese woman locked the door from the outside and warned us not to run away she said if we try to run she will cut off our hands and legs after two or three days the woman found a buyer for nang nu tsawm who paid 80 000 yuan some traffickers used physical violence after an acquaintance offered seng ja ban work in a restaurant in china and travel expenses to get there she and a friend accepted the broker took them across the border and handed them off a second broker took them to kunming the capital city of yunnan province and left them in a train station there two chinese men grabbed them and forced them onto a train seng ja ban and her friend with no money and unable to communicate and not knowing what else to do stayed on the train for three days and three nights the men then took them off the train and drove some distance before splitting up me and my friend tried to stay together we held each other and tried to stay together but the chinese men got mad and dragged us apart i had to go with the chinese husband seng ja ban said she managed to escape after about five years her friend never made it back to myanmar some survivors described men or female relatives of a groom coming to see them in some cases potential buyers were asked whether they wanted to purchase the bride in other cases trafficked women and girls were told to choose from a selection of husbands but in circumstances where it was clear they were being forced to marry htoi nu ja was 36 married and a mother of two when she was drugged and trafficked along with her 2 year old son they were held in a locked room they fed us sometimes but not always after three days they brought the men to the compound there was a high fence so no one could see what was happening inside the compound outside the room they showed me to 10 men at that time is was morning 7 a m they separated me from my baby and showed me to the men the original broker had gone and a second broker came and showed me to the men and asked me which one i liked when i said i didn t like any of the men the broker slapped me this continued for a few days and i kept refusing then the broker raped me the broker got mad to calm himself down at night he raped me it was a violent rape when i did not take off my clothes he beat me htoi nu ja said this continued for a week they kept slapping me and told me to choose a guy you re not a beauty she said that after a week i chose a chinese man a 40 year old man he paid 30 000 yuan 4 800 htoi nu ja s son was taken from her then she did not know where he was until several weeks later when a woman she believes was related to the trafficker helped her escape and recover her son traffickers seemed to have a plentiful supply of potential buyers and networks spanning china a mother of five seng ja ngai was trafficked at age 35 in 2014 transported to henan province in eastern china she said hey showed a chinese man to me but i had told them i didn t want to get married my face said i was angry the man declined to buy her the trafficker then took her to hunan province two more men came to look and declined to buy her he old woman got mad at me she said it is taking too long this never happens then we went to fuzhou there i also did not find a man at that time my age was over 30 so the price for a bride from 18 to 25 is a good price they can ask for whatever they want from the chinese family but over 30 years old they couldn t get as good a price as they want so the chinese men were making her upset seng ja ngai said the trafficker received a call saying there were two little girls in yingjiang near the myanmar border for her to sell she rushed there leaving seng ja ngai with another trafficker several survivors said traffickers tried to get them to agree to marriage by offering them a dowry payment trying to find a man they liked promising the victim would be freed at a specific time or arguing they could have a good life as a wife in china but when interviewees refused to marry voluntarily they were forcibly sold all interviewees described in this report as survivors were clear cases of trafficking when women resisted arrangements made by traffickers for them to marry they were sometimes told they had no choice because the traffickers had spent so much money transporting and feeding them at age 20 ja tsin mai took a job as a nanny for a relative once in china the relative urged ja tsin mai to marry when she refused the relative said i can t feed you anymore you ve already cost us much money so you have to get married the relative chose a buyer took the money and handed over ja tsin mai who was held for about a year and subjected to escalating physical and sexual violence others were told they could pay to be released in some cases the amount traffickers demanded was presented as the expenses the trafficker had incurred in other cases traffickers demanded as ransom the full sale price they expected for the woman or girl none of the survivors interviewed were able to pay the amount demanded ja seng htoi at age 20 was trafficked by a relative she said different men came to the home every day and met with me the chinese man asked me if i liked any of the men i said no i dislike them i want to go back home then the said we already spent the transportation fee for you but if you can pay back the money then you can go back ja seng htoi unable to pay eventually gave in and chose a husband after four years in captivity she managed to escape but was forced to leave her baby behind while trafficked women and girls were experiencing violence in china their families in myanmar were often in agony over the realization that their daughter wife or mother had disappeared a week after nang shayi 18 left for china her grandmother began to worry because she had not been in touch she travelled to yingjiang on the china side of the border and found the woman who recruited nang shayi the woman told my grandmother oh your granddaughter is a difficult person that s why we sent her to a place quite far from here said nang shayi she had been sold to a family a four day bus ride from kunming and was held for four years some brokers visited families of trafficked women and girls for several months bringing payments purported to be the woman or girl s salary to stop them worrying that they had lost contact with the woman or girl often families don t know it s trafficking an activist explained the broker usually sends one or two lakh a month to the family so they still believe in the broker mostly the broker convinced the family your daughter is working in china they have no contact with their daughter but they believe that they are okay then after six months no one can find the broker anymore eventually reality hits as the mother of nang seng ja i have only one daughter the mother of a young woman trafficked by her cousins said she is the only one for me when i heard that my daughter was human trafficked the feeling is one i can t express my world was totally blowing up and destroyed knowing participation in trafficking by the families buying women many of the survivors interviewed for this report said the families that purchased women and girls were fully aware that they were there involuntarily families told some of the women and girls they had been purchased and would be held against their will the families knowledge of the trafficking was often evidenced by careful measures they took to stop the women and girls from escaping and that some families that purchased trafficked women later threatened or attempted to resell them most of the trafficking survivors interviewed for this report were initially kept in a locked room and remained under close watch for months or years with their movement out of the house and access to telephones money and other people restricted or sometimes denied entirely pan pan tsawm trafficked at 15 and held for three years said she remained locked in a room around the clock until she became pregnant six or seven months later when i had sex with him his parents would lock the door from the outside she explained pan pan tsawm escaped back to myanmar leaving her daughter behind there were a few cases where the chinese families appeared to have been under the impression that the bride had come willingly and that the money paid was not a fee to a trafficker but a dowry payment to her family an activist said that in some cases a trafficker pretends to be the mother of the trafficked woman or girl and negotiates with the chinese family for a dowry in two cases families seem to have allowed or even helped trafficked women and girls to escape but most families seemed fully aware that they were buying a trafficked bride and in the instances that families seemed surprised to learn they had participated in trafficking they sometimes said they would free the bride only if their money was returned something the bride had little power to compel life in captivity twenty two of the 37 survivors interviewed for this report were held for a year or longer 11 were held for three years or longer the longest time in captivity among the survivors we interviewed was nine years almost none of the survivors went through legal wedding ceremonies to their chinese husbands though they were often referred to as wives by the families that bought them said one trafficking survivor no wedding ceremony but he had sex with me that s how it was decided that we were married some said the families that purchased them held a marriage celebration at some point sometimes soon after the trafficked woman or girl s arrival or after she became pregnant or gave birth seven months after she was sold seng moon became pregnant after learning of the pregnancy the family held a celebration inviting relatives and serving food though no wedding ceremony took place i wore jeans and a red blouse they gave it to me to wear they tied me with a red ribbon seng moon said no one ever asked me if i wanted to be married in a few cases the family had a ceremony but none seemed to be a legal marriage nang shayi trafficked at 18 said the family had a ceremony a week after she was handed over to them it looked like a wedding reception there was an announcement delivering the new couple the villagers came and also his relatives no official person like here no documents because i was from myanmar and i didn t have an id card so there was no documentation for our marriage confinement some women and girls were held for weeks or months by traffickers before being sold while others were turned over to purchasers within days or hours of crossing the border either way many trafficked women and girls spent the first weeks or months after they were trafficked locked in a room traffickers carefully ensured that women and girls did not escape and brides were guarded equally closely by the families that purchased them my aunt told me ahead of time that i shouldn t talk about what happens to me said seng ing nu trafficked at age 17 or 18 by her aunt from the first night when we arrived in the chinese man s house i had to sleep with him she said at the beginning of the night he followed me around there were only two rooms after her aunt left the family locked her in one of the rooms i heard that they worried about me trying to run away in some cases harshness at the beginning seemed designed to break the trafficked bride s will seng moon was 16 when she was trafficked by her sister in law my sister in law left me at the home when i entered the home the family members talked to me but i didn t know what they were saying the family took me to a room in that room i was tied up again the man tied me up they locked the door for one or two months when it was time for meals they sent meals in i was crying each time when the chinese man brought me meals he raped me there was a window but the window was black so i didn t know whether it was day or night whenever he brought the meal he said have the meal i said when you leave the meal i will eat it but he usually raped me before i had the meal the windows were blacked out but seng moon tried to keep track of time by marking days on a calendar in the room after two months they dragged me out of the room she said the father of the chinese man said here is your husband now you are a married couple be nice to each other and build a happy family over time brides usually gained a bit more freedom women and girls were sometimes let out of a locked room once they became pregnant after captive brides gave birth families often became less vigilant about preventing their escape but they often remained confined in the family compound or if permitted out were allowed only to go to the market and back and were closely supervised khawng shawng was kept locked in a room for the first 10 days while the man who had bought her worked on the family s coffee plantation one day khawng shawng had no choice but to defecate on the floor after that the man let her out but kept her with him all day even if i wanted to go to the toilet my mother in law would wait said khawng ja trafficked at age 17 and sold for 80 000 yuan 12 700 in the early days of captivity most women and girls interviewed were denied access to phones or allowed to use a phone only while being watched a few managed to communicate with family or a friend by stealing a phone or getting someone else to contact family or friends on their behalf later as restrictions loosened a few found ways to reach out looking for help often via wechat a popular chinese messaging app many others remained incommunicado sometimes for years nang seng ja was trafficked by her three cousins who planned to split the money but nang seng ja said the youngest cousin felt that she had been given less than her share of the proceeds in revenge she gave nang seng ja s mother the phone number for the family who had purchased nang seng ja when her mother called the family let them speak on speaker phone in the family s presence then my mom and i talked in kachin and the family got mad then i told my mom if we can give them 88 000 yuan they will release me the chinese family cut off the phone call and nang seng ja s family went to the specialized myanmar anti trafficking police two of nang seng ja s cousins who were in myanmar were arrested the chinese family went into hiding and kept nang seng ja locked in a room again rape once they were handed over to purchasers the trafficked women and girls interviewed were almost without exception raped and subjected to continuing sexual slavery most of the women and girls said that they were raped the first night that they spent with the family that had purchased them and forced into sex regularly during their captivity a woman who was trafficked twice explained the first husband when i arrived in his home i had to have sex with the man that night i was sent into the room with the chinese man and his father locked the room from the outside seng moon mai was raped as soon as she arrived at the home where the man who bought her lived with his parents and younger sister he just kept saying i bought you you are my wife i bought you she said they knew i didn t have any willingness to stay that s why they locked me in a room she said her husband demanded sex so often the first time i didn t accept i tried to escape we were fighting each other in the room so many times but after two or three months i thought this is useless so i stopped fighting seng moon mai escaped after about a year and a half seng nu ja 17 managed to delay being raped for several weeks as the man holding her captive tried to convince her to consent to sex with him after one month he began to use force and was violent with me day and night she said trafficked women and girls were under pressure to become pregnant and had almost no ability to refuse sex to access and use contraceptive methods or to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections two women were sterilized while in china one without realizing what was happening to her and the other through coercion one interviewee tested positive for hiv after escaping and was certain her chinese husband infected her she said she unknowingly passed the virus on to the man she married after her escape she was waiting to learn if her newborn was also infected demands for children and forced pregnancy many of the trafficked women and girls interviewed said that the families who bought them really did not want a wife but rather a child or children they were often under enormous pressure to become pregnant quickly one woman was even forced to undergo a medical examination at the demand of a potential buyer i was locked in the room for one year said seng ja ban trafficked at age 30 before i had a baby the family members especially the mother in law treated me badly her face was furious sometimes they didn t feed me because i didn t get pregnant as soon as possible some trafficked women and girls said that they were raped nightly or several times a day as their husband tried urgently for a pregnancy nang nu tsawm was trafficked at age 14 married to a 15 year old boy and gave birth to two children she was forced to leave in china in the beginning they locked me in a room she said we were both still young in the beginning the chinese and i slept together but we never had sex because we did not know about it after two months his parents took us and checked in the hospital to see if i was pregnant or not they saw no pregnancy then the mom complained she talked to her son my husband and gave him some sex films to watch then after he watched some kinds of movies we started having sex the chinese man told me i would need to have a baby said ja seng htoi trafficked at 20 i said i don t want to have a baby he pushed back and asked me to have a baby normally after myanmar girls in china have a baby they go home maybe you re like this so i decided to have a baby with him the chinese man told me that after the kid was one year old then i could go back ja seng htoi had a baby her husband and his family initially refused to let her leave but then relented and let her go while they kept the child some trafficked women and girls feared not becoming pregnant because they were afraid of angering their captors one described concealing a miscarriage out of fear one family tried to resell the bride they had purchased when she did not become pregnant others tried to avoid pregnancy one woman managed to secretly obtain and ingest drugs to induce abortion several women were forced to undergo what they believed were forced fertility treatments seng ja ban was 30 married and mother of a 5 year old daughter when she was trafficked she was held for five years and became pregnant at the end of the first year they gave me many medicines i did not know what they were once a week i was injected sometimes i had a big drip every week they took me to the clinic i did not know what the medicine was or why i had to take it sometimes i had to try herbal medicine and they cooked it and boiled it and i had to drink it i assume it was to make me pregnant some of the medicines made me allergic sometimes i became itchy on my skin she also said that she was given more medicines after giving birth and an adverse reaction to one nearly killed her after we give birth no one cares about us anymore she said adding that the family would not permit her to breastfeed her child a significant number of trafficked women and girls understood or were told explicitly that once they provided a baby they could leave so long as they left the baby after seng moon gave birth to a boy she told her husband that she wanted to go home to myanmar he replied no one plans to stop you if you want to go back home you can but you can t take my baby some families seemed equally happy to have a boy or a girl but others preferred boys nang shayi was trafficked at age 18 and became pregnant after five months because the first child was a boy they treated us very well she said then she gave birth to a girl she said her in laws told her she could not stay in china after having two children and could not obtain documentation for her children unless she was sterilized she reluctantly underwent a sterilization procedure after doing the operation the chinese man s mother totally changed she often yelled at me they discriminated between the boy and the girl even giving snacks especially his mother sometimes she yelled at me you myanmar people are bullshit and son of a bitch because you are just sex workers and worthless persons she used all kinds of bad words but the worst was the discrimination between the children the husband was nice to me but the problem was his mother sometimes she would physically attack me i couldn t stand such conditions any longer taking her daughter with her nang shayi ran and made it to myanmar she never saw her son again nang shayi s

after a week they let me wander around said nang shayi trafficked at age 18 the problem was in the village they d told everyone if i tried to run away the villagers should call them they gave them the

her make it onto the bus and across the border along the way i was afraid that the chinese man would follow me and find me she said the whole time i was ducking my head help sometimes came from unexpected quarters when seng moon mai was not pregnant after eight months of frequent rape the chinese family brought a kachin speaking woman to tell her she needed to have a baby seng moon mai begged the woman to help her escape and the woman agreed the woman told the family that seng moon mai would not have a baby until two or three years had passed and she felt like a real member of the family the woman visited a few times and then about nine months after they first met came and said she was going near the border they made plans for seng moon mai to wait by the road in the middle of

to pay for her transportation we made a plan to both get out from our families the next day i pretended to have a toothache saying she needed a dentist mai mai tsawm was allowed out she stole the family s identification documents and met her friend they caught a train to kunming to get the train ticket we would have to show an id card that is why i stole the family documents i used them to get train tickets when they reached kunming the women were out of money but they met some kachin women there who gave them money to make it to myanmar two months later however financially desperate because her family was displaced by fighting during her absence mai mai tsawm went back to china to look for work and was trafficked again she is one of several interviewees who escaped only to be trafficked again children left behind and escapes with children ten interviewees gave birth in china to children fathered by their captors most were forced to leave the children behind when they escaped or to choose between freedom and their children i gave birth said ning ja khawn who became pregnant three months after she was sold after one year the chinese man gave me a choice of what to do it took a lot of negotiation but then i got permission to go back home but not with the baby the family members didn t allow me to take care of the baby only give birth and give the baby milk breastfeed the baby then the mother in law took the baby and cared for the baby they would not let me be the mother some women accepted that they could escape only if they left children behind in the beginning i did not miss my son because i thought he was not my baby only the chinese man s baby said seng ing nu trafficked at age 17 or 18 who left a one year old behind when she escaped but now i got married to another man and had another baby now i miss him often seng ing nu never saw her son again after escaping in 2013 several women returned or tried to return to china to be with their children nang nu tsawm was trafficked at age 14 and married to a 15 year old chinese boy she gave birth to a girl and a boy and had been in china over five years when police alerted to her presence when another trafficked bride in the village escaped and ran to the police came to the home and arrested her for being in the country illegally nang nu tsawm was held in jail for several weeks then deported her children remained with the family that bought her when i arrived home i missed my children so much nang nu tsawm said after a year she contacted her husband and asked to see her children she travelled to the chinese side of the border and he came to meet her but when she tried to go with him to his home she was stopped at a checkpoint for not having travel documents so i turned back she said since then i have never seen my children only three of the trafficked women and girls interviewed managed to escape with their children and of those three one escaped with one child while leaving the other behind marang seng trafficked at 18 and held for four years gave birth in captivity to a son and a daughter she said the family was very kind to her son but treated her daughter badly because the daughter was less guarded by the family than the son marang seng managed to escape with her her son stayed behind and she has never seen him again seng moon trafficked at 16 was determined to escape with her son and after over two years in captivity she saw a chance by now she was allowed to go to the market and there she met a kachin woman selling vegetables she begged the woman for money and the woman loaned her 1 000 yuan 160 she hired a car and made it to near the myanmar border before running out of money as she sat crying by the side of the road with her son a chinese woman stopped after she explained her situation the woman took them home and cared for them for a month then gave seng moon 200 yuan 30 and told her how to get home by bus when human rights watch interviewed seng moon she was back in the idp camp and recently married she had told no one aside from her family about her experience of being trafficked and had no plans to try to have the traffickers or the chinese family arrested i m afraid she said if the police hear my story they will try to find the chinese family and the chinese family will try to find me i m afraid they will find me rebuilding life back in myanmar the trafficking survivors interviewed for this report were almost without exception vulnerable to trafficking because of desperate poverty exacerbated by the armed conflict when they escaped back to myanmar the same poverty awaited them and some found their families had been harmed further in their absence by the conflict they also struggled with new burdens of trauma stigma desperation to be reunited with children they were forced to leave in china a need for legal assistance to pursue those who trafficked them and health concerns sitau kong nuey struggled to rebuild her life after the chinese police deported her abruptly five or six years after she was trafficked at age 14 she tried to return to the family that bought her because she missed her two children but was blocked because she did not have a visa she returned to china to work in a restaurant but fled when the owner tried to traffic her again she found work in banana fields in myanmar but said she had nearly died from poisoning from chemicals used in banana cultivation when human rights watch interviewed her she had married six months earlier but said her new husband was abusive and regularly beat her the two of them were working on a road paving job six days a week 10 hours a day but still unable to support their family which included nang nu tsawm s husband s five younger siblings those who returned to myanmar after being gone for years faced difficulties in trying to rebuild relationships with family members who had given them up for dead when i arrived back to my family the family members thought that i was human trafficked and that i was killed and they assumed i would never come back nang nu tsawm said trafficked at age 14 and gone five or six years holding this secret inside stigma and discrimination against trafficking survivors survivors of bride trafficking often face devastating stigma much of the stigma is related to the fact that victims have been raped and held in sexual slavery some escaped from china but do not dare to come back home because they are ashamed about the situation and what happened to them said moon moon mai who was trafficked at about age 46 discussing the 10 to 20 other survivors she said she knows in our kachin society we look down on people who live together with another person and don t get married or have sex with another person without being married we came back home and were looked down on by our community even though we got married with a kachin guy in the future his relatives and his family i m sure i will be condemned and looked down upon forever that s why even those who escape from china just get married to a chinese man in myanmar this stigma and the secrecy it prompts cuts survivors off from the few services that exist and reduces public awareness of the risk of trafficking in the communities most affected survivors often tried to conceal what had happened to them sometimes even from their families there are people who were trafficked but they have never told this to another person ja tsin mai trafficked in 2011 said they hide it as a secret we do not talk about it openly some survivors loved ones urged them to keep quiet after four months of being held in a locked room and repeatedly raped khawng shawng escaped back to myanmar and her husband he asked me how much money do you have i said don t ask me how much money ask me what happened to me in china he asked and i told him about my situation my husband was crying i was crying then my husband suggested don t tell this story to anyone else because people might look down on you because you were trafficked to china and that s why until today i didn t tell anyone survivors and experts said women and girls who have been trafficked are sometimes seen as being at least partly to blame for being trafficked this happened because you were foolish was the response htoi nu ja said she received when idp camp acquaintances heard about her experience of being trafficked sold and raped people might think that people trafficked to china have behaved in ways that are not good and that s why they were trafficked said seng moon mai trafficked and held for a year and a half in the community there are so many people who look down on women who have been trafficked in close knit idp camps or villages rumors travel quickly in the beginning i had so many difficulties said shayi trafficked at 17 in 2014 describing her return to the idp camp everyone was gossiping about me i felt doubt i was looked down on when i came back i didn t dare to go out i am quite ashamed to meet my friends whether they know or not about my story i feel i have to talk with them but i cannot share what happened the stigma is so strong that it drives some survivors not to come home when seng ja htoi escaped back to myanmar after being trafficked and held for two months she went to live with a relative instead of returning to her family in the idp camp i feel ashamed to stay in here and meet anyone from the camp so now i stay outside she said friends are gossiping about me because i was trafficked some survivors blamed themselves i feel shame because of what happened to me said pan pan tsawm trafficked at 15 she said she told only her family what had happened to her they say nothing they gave no comment shayi was trafficked at age 17 after seeking work to pay her and her sister s school fees she said i was full of worry that i would get pregnant but i kept praying for forgiveness poor people like us are greedy for money which is why this happened to me god may have been punishing me so i accepted it my life had already been ruined abo

1m for the year to 31 december 2018 an increase of 14 2m on the previous year group revenue of 275 8m has increased by 14 7m from the previous year primarily reflecting timing differences in respect of pso revenues excluding pso timing differences operating profit has increased by 3 6m year on year largely as a result of an increasing regulatory return due to the group s increasing asset base group operating costs of 166 7m are largely in line with operating costs of 166 2m in 2017 ffo interest cover the group considers the ratio of ffo funds from operations to interest paid to be one of

bonds are denominated in sterling and carry fixed interest rates of 2 500 and 6 375 respectively given that 100 of the group s total borrowings carry a fixed interest rate the group does not consider that it is significantly exposed to interest rate risk since december 2010 nie networks has held a 550m portfolio of rpi linked interest rate swaps the rpi swaps the rpi swaps were put in place by the viridian group the group s previous parent undertaking in 2006 to better match nie networks debt and related interest payments with its inflation linked regulated assets and associated revenue the swaps are considered to be economic hedges for nie networks regulated revenue and asset base as part of the acquisition of nie networks by esb in 2010 the swaps were novated to nie networks following a restructuring in 2014 the swaps have a mandatory break period in 2022 at the same time that the restructuring took effect and in order to achieve a back to back matching arrangement the company entered into rpi linked interest rate swaps with esbni limited esbni the immediate parent undertaking of the company which have identical matching terms to the restructured swaps the back to back

recycling rate 97 98 health safety ensuring the health safety and wellbeing of employees contractors and the general public continues to be the number one value at the core of all nie networks business operations the aim is to provide a zero harm working environment where risks to health and safety are assessed and controlled this is achieved by the promotion of a positive health and safety culture and adherence to legislation and recognised safety standards the approach to safety is based on the principles of leadership competence compliance and engagement the health and safety management system is accredited to iso 45001 standard and based on best practice guidance from the health and safety executive for northern ireland hseni and the institute of directors nie networks continues to engage with various organisations including the hseni the ni utilities safety group the ni roads authority and utility committees the ni environment agency and various energy networks association ena health and safety committees to share information and improve safety performance and learning the target for lost time incidents continues to be set at zero there were two incidents during the year 2017 one both of which occurred during non operational activities safety engineers are aligned with organisational structures on a business partner relationship which facilitates integration of skills and allows influence and support during 2018 the safety team continued to support all business units with particular focus on the following areas the reporting analysis and investigation of near miss events which is key to reducing harm the quality of reports continued to improve with an increase in reports detailing unsafe acts each report is analysed by a team of safety engineers to ensure consistency and accurate follow up enabling further improvements in equipment and operational procedures to be identified and addressed formal incident investigation procedures with monthly reporting to the health and safety management committee three external iso audits were completed with zero non conformances identified including transition to the new iso 45001 standard continued programme of formal safety training for employees and contractors including safety seminars delivered to all staff to increase risk awareness and perception the publication of a monthly safety newsletter and contractor management safety improvement plans implemented a further 18 employees attained certificates in construction health and safety from the national examination board in occupational safety and health nebosh bringing the total within the group to 90 employees over 4 000 site safety inspections completed the focus of which was to provide coaching and recognition and to encourage good site behaviours while ensuring compliance was achieved in line with the leadership and engagement principles these were completed by a range of staff including the managing director executive committee members business unit managers and front line managers continued focus on identifying the causes of road traffic incidents including post incident driver appraisals and training where required and a programme of health and wellbeing checks health screening and lifestyle advice was made available to all staff to coincide with european health safety week updates on safety performance are provided to each executive committee board and health and safety management committee meeting this provides a level of regular assurance against objectives agreed in the annual health safety and wellbeing business plan network performance and customer service the provision of a safe reliable and responsive electricity service which endeavours to meet the standards customers expect and to deal with customers professionally courteously and respecting their individual needs is a key priority for nie networks during 2018 nie networks continued to efficiently manage outages required for essential maintenance and development to minimise the occasions and length of time that customers are off supply performance of the distribution network is measured in its availability the number of minutes lost per customer cml cml due to planned outages is the average number of minutes lost per customer for the period through pre arranged shutdowns for maintenance and construction the number of planned cml for 2018 was 41 minutes 2017 62 minutes the average number of cml due to faults on the distribution network in 2018 was 53 minutes 2017 57 minutes both measures show an improvement on the previous year and are calculated excluding incidences where severe weather exemptions have been applied as agreed with the utility regulator the utility regulator sets overall and guaranteed standards of performance the majority apply to services provided for example the timely restoration of customers supplies following an interruption and prescribed times for responding to customers voltage complaints all of the overall standards were achieved in 2018 there were no defaults against guaranteed standards of performance for customer service activities delivered 2017 one during the year 94 2 2017 91 5 of electricity supplies were restored within three hours within the regulatory standard of 87 nie networks continues to test and confirm the robustness of its emergency response capabilities during severe weather events in order to effectively restore supply to all customers the significant commitment from staff across the business helps to ensure that nie networks manages effectively this very important aspect of the business with every employee having an escalation role in addition to their normal day to day role during the year there were four occasions wind and gales in early and mid january gales in june and storm ali in september where adverse weather caused damage to the network and affected thousands of customers supplies on each of these occasions on average 98 of affected customers were restored within 24 hours the focus on reducing the number of complaints from customers continued in 2018 with the number of complaints received being 7 lower than in the previous year individual complaints received are analysed and assessed based on the specific circumstances to determine whether or not the complaint was avoidable the continued strong focus on customer service limits the number of instances when customers are dissatisfied to the extent that they refer a complaint to the consumer council for northern ireland ccni for review stage 2 complaints during the year one stage 2 complaint was taken up by the ccni on behalf of customers 2017 two across nie networks there has been a focus on reviewing

customer engagement award at the 2018 contact centre awards in ni demonstrating the group s commitment to providing the best possible customer service connections nie networks connections business provides safe secure reliable and timely electricity connections within northern ireland typically connections work involves connecting new or additional load for housing farms and businesses altering the network or connecting generators to the distribution network more recently customers have expressed interest in connecting energy storage devices to the network the key areas of focus during 2018 were preparing for market opening in march 2018 in respect of new distribution connections less than 5mw and completing renewable generation connections in line with developers requirements to meet accreditation deadlines for the northern ireland renewables obligation niro scheme the market for greater than 5mw distribution connections has been open to competition since may 2016 on 28 march 2018 nie networks successfully facilitated market opening for all new connections including those less than 5mw in accordance with the framework and principles agreed with the utility regulator this required the completion of a very significant work programme involving substantial it development implementation of new processes and staff training to facilitate competition for contestable elements of connections customers can now choose whether to accept a quotation from nie networks or to engage an accredited icp to construct the connection there are a number of accredited icps registered to complete the contestable elements of connections in northern ireland icps must adhere to nie networks policies and technical specifications when completing the contestable works nie networks has introduced new processes to carry out design reviews inspections and asset adoption for any contestable elements of works carried out by icps further information in relation to competition in connections for customers and icps is available on nie networks website at a high level of renewable generation connections was also delivered during the year including as outlined above connections in line with developers requirements to meet accreditation deadlines for the niro scheme 179mw of large scale generation typically 5mw 40mw windfarms was connected during the year taking the total large scale generation connected to the network to 1 284mw 78 of total renewable generation capacity a significant proportion of large scale generation was connected through clusters including the construction during the year of a 90mw cluster at drumquin in co tyrone clusters are 110kv connection nodes established in the vicinity of a number of renewable generation projects to enable additional capacity to be connected in line with nie networks licence obligation to develop the network in an efficient and economic manner 24mw of small scale generation typically 20kw 5mw single wind turbines anaerobic digesters photovoltaic and hydro installations was connected during the year taking the total connected small scale generation to 284mw 17 of total renewable generation capacity total micro generation connections typically 4 12kw photovoltaic panels on domestic rooftops to the network increased to 83mw 5 of total renewable generation capacity including 1mw added

changes in equity for the year then ended and the notes to the financial statements which include a description of the significant accounting policies our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the audit risk committee basis for opinion we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing uk isas uk and applicable law our responsibilities under isas uk are further described in the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion independence we remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the uk which includes the frc s ethical standard as applicable to listed public interest entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements to the best of our knowledge and belief we declare that non audit services prohibited by the frc s ethical standard were not provided to the group or the parent company other than those disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements we have provided no non audit services to the group or the parent company in the period from 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2018 our audit approach overview materiality overall group materiality 3 307 500 2017 2 650 000 based on 5 of profit before tax overall parent company materiality 3 207 500 2017 2 550 000 based on 5 of profit before tax audit scope we performed full audit scope over financially significant components northern ireland electricity networks limited nie finance plc and nie networks services limited key audit matters accounting estimates unbilled debt group and parent accounting for connections group and parent the scope of our audit as part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements capability of the audit in detecting irregularities including fraud based on our understanding of the group and industry we identified that the principal risks of non compliance with laws and regulations related to the listing rules the requirements of the northern ireland authority for utility regulation and we considered the extent to which non compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements we also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the companies act 2006 we evaluated management s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements including the risk of override of controls and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce expenditure and management bias in accounting estimates the group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and or component auditors included discussions with management internal audit and the group s legal advisors including consideration of known or suspected instances of non compliance with laws and regulation and fraud we have audited key reconciliations obtained external confirmations and incorporated elements of unpredictability into our audit testing challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates in particular in relation to accounting for unbilled debt see related key audit matter below we have discussed and understood the nature of open matters between the company and the northern ireland authority for utility regulation and identifying and testing journal entries in particular any journal entries posted with an unusual description unusual nominal account combinations against revenue operating expenses and unbilled debt or entries made by unexpected persons there are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements the less likely we would become aware of it also the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by for example forgery or intentional misrepresentations or through collusion key audit matters key audit matters are those matters that in the auditors professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team these matters and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters this is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit key audit matter how our audit addressed the key audit matter accounting estimates unbilled debt unbilled revenue is based on an estimation in respect of consumption derived using historical data and detailed assumptions estimation uncertainty and the complexity of calculations give rise to heightened misstatement risk and are therefore a focus of our audit work group and parent we understood and tested the processes and internal controls which nie networks has in place for the estimation of unbilled revenue we performed testing over the systems that support unbilled revenue to include agreement of volume and pricing data between the billing system and the unbilled model the appropriateness of underlying assumptions and their consistency and consideration of the outcome of prior period estimates our specialist data team provided support in the assessment and testing of this model we concluded that unbilled revenue was appropriately stated accounting for connections for each connections job the group incurs direct and indirect costs as well as a margin that is capitalised on receipt of the customer payment a deferred income balance arises which is released to the income statement over time the application of ifrs 15 to this area and the interrelationship between the balances deferred income capitalisation and release to the income statement is complex and therefore a focus for our audit work group and parent we assessed that revenue recognition is in line with the revenue recognition requirements of ifrs15 revenue from contracts with customers we identified assessed and tested key controls that exist within the nie networks capitalisation process to ensure that they are designed implemented and operating effectively we examined if costs capitalised during the year were accounted for in accordance with the requirements of ias 16 property plant and equipment and the group policy we gained an understanding of and performed testing over the opening ifrs15 adjustment which resulted in an increase to the deferred income balance in relation to incomplete performance obligations we performed substantive testing over deferred income balances including transfers from payments on account as well as testing the associated capitalisation of costs and revenue releases how we tailored the audit scope we tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which they operate as part of our procedures to develop our audit strategy as well as meeting with management we attended some audit risk committee meetings during the year engaged with internal audit and performed interim review procedures the northern ireland electricity networks limited group comprises of northern ireland electricity networks limited nie finance plc and nie networks services limited all companies are financially significant to the group and therefore required an audit of their complete financial information as part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements in particular we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud materiality the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality we set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality these together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows group financial statements parent company financial statements overall materiality 3 307 500 2017 2 650 000 3 207 500 2017 2 550 000 how we determined it 5 of profit before tax 5 of profit before tax rationale for benchmark applied based on the benchmarks used in the annual report profit before tax is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the group and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark we believe that profit before tax is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the entity and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark for each component in the scope of our group audit we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality the range of materiality allocated across components was between 93 980 and 2 650 000 certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality we agreed with the audit risk committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 165 000 group audit 2017 132 500 and 132 500 parent company audit 2017 165 000 as well as misstatements below those amounts that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons conclusions relating to going concern isas uk require us to report to you when the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate or the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group s and parent company s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue we have nothing to report in respect of the above matters however because not all future events or conditions can be predicted this statement is not a guarantee as to the group s and parent company s ability to continue as a going concern for example the terms on which the united kingdom may withdraw from the european union which is currently due to occur on 29 march 2019 are not clear and it is difficult to evaluate all of the potential implications on the company s trade customers suppliers and the wider economy reporting on other information the other information comprises all of the information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon the directors are responsible for the other information our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express an audit opinion or except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report any form of assurance thereon in connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated if we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information if based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact we have nothing to report based on these responsibilities with respect to the group strategic report and group directors report we also considered whether the disclosures required by the uk companies act 2006 have been included based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit isas uk require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below group strategic report and group directors report in our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the group strategic report and group directors report for the year ended 31 december 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit we did not identify any material misstatements in the group strategic report and group directors report responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements as explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement set out on page 26 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view the directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error in preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the group s and the parent company s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas uk will always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the frc s website at

operations as well as other immaterial corrections we identified during our review roberto will give some more details but the changes to our preliminary 2019 guidance are not related to the issues we corrected for our performance in 2018 was guided by the strategic pillars we set years ago that serve as the guide for our business remain committed to building upon our best in class growth engine leading to superior technology delivering scale through superior execution and leveraging our culture to attract and retain the best employees executing against these pillars has allowed us to post another outstanding year underscored by record revenue new and innovative products and strategic m a that has expanded our penetration into the high growth and dynamic corporate payments in consumer directed healthcare market the progress made in 2018 is a testament to our ability to gain market share by deepening existing relationship building new partnerships and delivering high quality service and innovative technologies through our expanding customer base while executing on our acquisition strategy for long term growth we continue to have significant new segment wins and contract renewals in the fourth quarter in fleet solutions revenue grew 15 driven by higher volume growth increased late fees and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds including higher fuel prices our strong track record of new contract wins and partnership renewals gained momentum in 2018 for example we signed new fleet contracts with railcrew xpress and aeromar canada and also renewed significant contracts with element financial and enterprise rental in the over the road business we had one of our best implementation quarters in the history of the business including horizon transport and csi ph we also made significant progress on the implementation and integration of several large prior contract wins most notably shell and chevron portfolio those conversions are progressing and i m pleased to report that the new wex card have been issued to all customers of the two portfolios we re now in a transition period as customers convert to the new products and the accounts receivable balances pull over to us which we expect it to be complete in the next several months we remain well positioned to win new business and generate organic revenue growth our best in class marketing and sales teams are helping us to capture additional market share in addition to wins and renewals the service and support we provide our customers day in and day out truly differentiates us from our peers one example of this is our exxonmobil portfolio which has had one of its best years ever in terms of new account growth in the us in travel and corporate solutions we closed the year with an impressive 29 increase in revenue during q4 this was driven by strengthening our relationships with industry leading online travel agencies while penetrating further into the rapidly growing corporate payment space with 8 2 billion in purchase volume this quarter which is an increase of more than 800 million over last year approximately 45 of this increase came in our corporate payment business in addition to our own sales effort our partnership strategy has proven to be successful and strong revenue driver for us one of these partners is american express and we signed an agreement in q3 for the use of our technology platform we are still in the early stages of this relationship we re beginning to see increasing volumes as we get the program up and running we also had a handful of significant contract wins and renewals during the fourth quarter one that i m excited to announce is the signing of swedish based etraveli one of the largest of otas in europe in the top 15 globally travel and corporate payments remains an important area for our future growth given the size and the underlying growth dynamics in the market while we ve had more than 34 billion in purchase volume during 2018 there is still ample room for growth and we look forward to these opportunities in the coming year as i mentioned in the november investor day corporate payments will be a key area of focus for us in 2019 and beyond moving onto the health and employee benefit solutions our us healthcare business was robust and posted topline growth of more than 12 in the quarter and 14 for the full year in health we saw a successful open enrollment season with the volume of transactions up 18 year over year we closed 2018 with over 65 new or renewed partners the service we offer our partners sets us apart from our competition and we continue to see 50 growth in utilization of our mobile app in online partner portal these tools continue to enhance the partner experience and constant innovation exceeded the success in this market turning to new signings and renewals we re pleased to announce we have signed associated bank nova stanley benefits boyu financial in the fourth quarter in additions to renewing a number of meaningful contracts we now have more than 28 million consumers on the wex health cloud platform i d like to delve a little deeper in our second strategic pillar and the bedrock of our business wex s superior technology we spent a significant amount of time over the past year adopting a cloud first development process which we talked about at length in november during q4 we began migrating our fleet technology platform to the cloud this is the first of many conversions over the next couple of years we are making great progress with little disruption to our customers inaudible fleet segment we re making progress towards consolidating processing platforms and has eliminated one platform this year we plan to continue with this consolidation strategy we are also migrating the processing of our travel product one to an internal cloud based virtual card platform we call tag which was acquired as part of the 2017 aoc acquisition we re starting to move our us business onto tag and we have already processed over 1 5 billion of transactions on a run rate basis in q4 this too is completed with little to no disruption to our customers as we talked about in our investor day in november these moves to the cloud will allow us to improve performance of stability increase the pace of product development and eventually deliver significant cost savings which we are starting to see in our 2019 guidance since we last spoke we ve acquired discovery benefits one of the fastest growing benefits solution providers in the marketplace with operations in all 50 states we re particularly excited about this transaction as it expands our penetration into the attractive high growth consumer directed healthcare market aligns with our growth strategy including further diversifying the business away from fuel complements and enhances our value proposition in the marketplace and provide significant cost synergies with long term upside potential ultimately we believe this transaction strengthens wex s position as a leading provider of innovative healthcare technology solution with greater size scale and capability we plan to successfully leverage our core technologies to improve our competitiveness in the pbh market and are strong platform for future acquisitions before i wrap up my remarks i also wanted to provide an update on the noventis acquisition we closed in january as a reminder they are an electronic payment network and optimize the payment delivery process through their patented scalable technology it complements our current offerings with new payment delivery capabilities that enhance ap payments and provide seamless delivery of electronic payments this acquisition expands wex reach as a corporate payments supplier who provides more channels to billing aggregators and financial institutions we re on schedule to fully integrate noventis into the wex corporate payments platform by the end of this year we are very excited about the new opportunities that we expect to capture in years ahead as i look back at 2018 i m very pleased that we will be able to execute against all of our strategic pillars we ve had revenue and earnings per share growth in line with our long term target we again achieved recognition with great place to work it s rated by almost 90 of all wex employees who filled out the survey finally this year marked a year of significant technology milestone for wex we re excited to see what s next as we expand our capabilities we ve had huge wins in the marketplace like shell and chevron we had a very

poised for growth in 2019 and i look forward to another successful year for wex i d now like to turn the call over to our cfo roberto simon roberto roberto simon chief financial officer thank you and good afternoon everyone as melissa mentioned earlier i will like to provide you with an update on wex s internal financial statement review in addition the recently filed 10 k 10 k a and press release contain updates to the preliminary results issued on february 22 2019 during the company s 2018 year end close process wex identified immaterial errors in the financial statements of our brazilian subsidiary which began before 2015 and are primarily related to accounts receivable and accounts payable the financial statements have been corrected for these matters at the same time we revised the financial statements to correct other immaterial variances impacting prior years that were not previously recorded wex believes that the effects of the provision is not material to our previously issued consolidated financial statements we are actively engaged in the implementation of our remediation plan to ensure that controls are designed appropriately and will operate effectively changing gears to the 2018 results i want to pause for a moment to discuss the results for the full year in 2018 wex outperform again with revenue growth of 20 and adjusted net income growth of 56 when compared to 2017 we had significant organic revenue growth in the business supplement with the m a activity in the fleet segment revenue grew 18 10 of this relates to macro economic factors and revenue recognition in the travel and corporate solutions segment revenue grew 35 approximately half of this growth was due to m a and revenue recognition finally the us health business grew 14 now let s move to the q4 results we had a strong organic revenue and adjusted net income growth driven by robust results from fleet solutions and travel and corporate solutions segment the us healthcare business also performed better than expected with solid revenue growth from an earnings point of view we continue to benefit from these organic growth positive macroeconomic trends and a lower tax rate overall we are pleased with the fourth quarter performance on both top and bottom line results for the fourth quarter of 2018 our total revenue was 381 2 million 15 increase over the prior year non gaap adjusted net income was 91 8 million or 2 11 per diluted share up 34 from 1 57 in line with guidance i want to quickly point out that we are still benefiting from the new revenue recognition standards the total benefit was 10 9 million which is similar to prior quarters now on to the segment results the fleet solutions segment achieved 253 8 million in revenue an increase of 15 compared to prior year payment processing revenue increased 35 and finance fee revenue increased 10 the gains were led by the north america fleets business which grew 14 followed by the over the road which grew 22 both of these growth rates benefited from higher steel prices and the new revenue recognition standards we also saw a strong growth rate in asia at 59 and europe at 15 within the fleet segment we continue to see solid organic transaction growth of 6 5 driven by new sales at the same time we continue to maintain very low attrition rates and finally same store sales were marginally negative due in part to the government shutdown the net interchange rate in q4 was 138 basis points which was up 20 basis points over last year there are three items that had a positive impact on the rate year to date revenue reclassification higher steel ph spreads from the european operations and the revenue recognition changes finally in the segment the average domestic fuel price in q4 was 2 94 versus 2 68 in 2017 we have approximately 13 5 million of additional revenue versus prior year due to higher fuel prices including spread impact in europe turning to our travel and corporate solutions segment we finished the year with the same strong momentum that we had all year total revenue for the quarter increased 29 versus last year which was almost all organic total purchase volume issued by wex reached 8 2 billion this represents 11 organic growth and excludes aoc customers within the us the travel business remained steady with revenue growth of 13 and the corporate payment business was very strong with revenue growth exceeding 100 lastly the international business growth was led by europe brazil and australia the net interchange rate in the fourth quarter was 64 basis points which was 11 basis points higher compared to q4 2017 the increase was due to customer volume mix domestic and international spend mix and lower rebates moving on to health and employee benefit segment the us health business surpassed expectations again growing 12 year over year and continues to support vigorous growth momentum the average number of such accounts was up 17 and total purchase volume was up 12 the volume of transactions during open enrollment season was up 18 over the prior year and the pipeline remains strong in the long term we continue to expect high teens growth in this business as expected we continue to see significant low bound ph in the brazilian benefits business as a result revenue in the health and employee benefits solutions segment decreased 4 in the quarter let s now move to expenses for the quarter total cost of service expenses were 137 6 million up from 126 4 million in q4 last year total sg a depreciation and amortization expenses would have 149 8 million which is up 18 1 million breaking down the line items within these categories processing costs increased 7 7 million primarily due to aoc and the onboarding costs or shell on chevron service fees was down 1 7 million mainly due to the reclassification of network fees as part of the revenue recognition changes revenue loss during the quarter was 16 1 million up from 13 5 million a year ago we recorded 1 3 million expense related to the brazil benefit business in the fleet segment credit loss was at the low end of the guidance coming in at 12 2 basis points of the spend volume operating interest was 10 1 million this is in line with expectations and was mostly due to higher fuel prices and interest rates g a expenses were up 6 3 million for acquisition related costs and legal expenses finally sales and marketing expenses were up 18 5 million largely due to the new revenue recognition and the on boarding costs for shell and chevron now on onto discuss taxes on a gaap basis the effective tax rate this quarter was 44 3 on a non gaap basis ani tax rate was 25 compared to 36 a year ago the company continued to benefit from the tax reform i will now be discussing our balance sheet we ended the quarter with 541 million in cash up from 504 million at the end of last year our corporate cash balance at year end stands at 181 million after making the payment related to the acquisition of the chevron portfolio additionally we have approximately 666 million available on the revolving line of credit which give us access to more than 800 million in capital also at year end we had a total balance 2 1 billion on the revolving line of credit term loans and notes the leverage ratio at the timing of our credit agreement stands at approximately 3 1 times down from 3 7 times at the end of last year as a reminder we have been delevering as expected since the time of ess acquisition at the rate of half a turn to three quarters of a turn per year during january we announced that we can increase borrowing capacity and improved our financial covenants in order to fund acquisitions when we pro forma for the noventis and dbi transactions we expect the leverage ratio to be approximately four times we continue to see unrealized gains on the interest rate hedges we have in place as of quarter end the market value of those hedges was 18 million we have 250 million of hedges rolling off at the end of 2018 during march this year we had secured another 450 million of interest rate hedges locking in libor at approximately 240 basis points including the debt from the dbi and noventis deals we expect to have about 65 of our financing debt balance essentially at fixed interest rates finally let s look at our guidance note that these expectations reflect our views as of today and are made on a non gaap basis with respect to adjusted net income before we get into the numbers i want to give you some puts and takes that should be considered when modeling 2019 first and most important the guidance is within our long term targets of 10 to 15 growth in revenue and 15 to 20 growth in earnings these targets assume constant fuel prices and fx rates starting with the fleet segment our 2019 plan are notably higher then the long term targets provided at the investor day for three key factors first we look to maintain a strong transaction growth rates second we anticipate to fully benefit from the shell and chevron portfolios in the second half of the year and third we look forward to continued progress in the international businesses specific to the shell and chevron win i want to give you some details around the progression through the year as melisa said we have mailed out to all of the customers and we are beginning to see them transition on to our platform it will take several months for this transition to be complete meanwhile we are carrying significant costs as we did at the end of 2018 so we expect the two portfolios to be diluted towards first half of the year and move to normal profitability when fully compared in the second half of the year and beyond finally in this segment we anticipate that fuel prices will be lower than 2018 negatively impacting revenue by approximately 50 million moving into the travel and corporate solutions segment revenue is expected to grow in excess of 30 including approximately 35 million from the noventis acquisition excluding noventis we expect the revenue will be within our long term guidance range of 10 to 15 growth we also expect organic volume to grow in the mid to high teens turning to the net interchange rate for the full year we expect the rate to increase approximately 10 basis points versus the full year rate in 2018 the main reasons for the increase are the acquisition of noventis and the renegotiation of ots contract which will shape revenue from other revenue to payment processing revenue regarding the health and employee benefits segment we expect our us health business to grow revenue in the high teens in line with expectations said at investor day additionally we expect approximately 75 million in revenue as a result of the dbi acquisition which closed earlier this month as we said when we announced the deal we do not expect a material impact on earnings this year in the brazil benefits business we expect another challenging year moving on to the financing side we are assuming an increase in libor of approximately 40 basis points on average from 2018 this increase would impact approximately 900 million of floating rate debt which includes the debt for dbi and noventis in addition we have approximately 1 2 billion in deposits at our bank that will also be impacted by the higher interest rates now for our guidance numbers we have updated our revenue range by 50 million from our previously issued revenue guidance this includes an increase of approximately 75 million for dbi this is also includes at 25 million reduction from noventis after concluding how the new revenue recognition standards will place to these transaction for the full year we expect revenue to be in the range of 1 68 billion to 1 72 billion and adjusted net income in the range 385 million to 403 million on an eps basis we expect adjusted net income to be between 8 80 and 9 20 per diluted share for the first quarter we expect revenue to be in the range of 375 million to 380 million our adjusted net income to be in the range of 72 million to 74 million on an eps basis we expect adjusted net income to be between 1 64 and 1 70 per diluted share now let me inaudible exchange rates are based as of mid february 2019 we assume that domestic steel prices will average 2 60 in the first quarter and 2 63 for the full year these assumption for the us is based on the applicable nymex future price from the week of february 18 the fleet credit loss will be between 13 basis points and 18 basis points both for the first quarter of the full year the company expects its 2019 adjusted net income tax rate for the full year to be between 24 5 and 26 and finally we are assuming that there will be approximately 43 9 million shares outstanding for the year to conclude we are very confident about 2019 guidance and are looking forward to a great year and now we are opening the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ramsey el assal from barclays your line is open ramsey el assal barclays analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question can you give us a little more color on the brazil situation sort of what happened there exactly was it just an accounting error but there is no indication of any type of malfeasance or anything like that or willfulness statements as of past results this is just simply an error that you ve cleared up and now it is completely behind you if you could provide a little more color there would be appreciated roberto simon chief financial officer so this is roberto good afternoon the majority of issues we found in the brazil fleet was our fleet business the process is you know where highly manual and in the past two years we have been improving both processes overtime and the other thing i would say to you is that finally the volume on this particular segment has climbed significantly in the past two years so this is why you know as we look into 2019 we feel comfortable on where we are melissa smith president and chief executive officer it is melissa i make sure that we respond to your second question one of the things we did as part of the process was we engaged one of the big four firms to perform work for us and we did not find any evidence of fraud or intended ph errors by that process so things are absolutely clear ramsey el assal barclays analyst okay that s super helpful thanks so much i wanted to ask also about your corporate payments growth rate which was extraordinary can you give us a little more color in terms of what industry verticals there are driving that or solutions you have that are driving that and also just bolted onto that it looks like your credit loss expectations for 2019 or little higher than your full year 2018 outlook and i was just curious as to what the what is causing that to be elevated a little bit is it increases is it on the credit side rather in fraud side or any color there could help as well and then i ll hop back in the queue melissa smith president and chief executive officer yes sure roberto actually gave some pretty good color of the corporate payment side we actually if you look across the portfolio we saw great growth but we saw over sized growth in some of the areas like the corporate payments inaudible and more we think of the business we re segmenting it between travel and corporate payment government payments it is a bigger market it s the higher growth rates and we ve been putting an increasing amount of capital and efforts towards that space so that s a piece of it we are going of relatively small base which helps but that piece of it also growth outside of united states as the business continue to globalize we ve added and really strengthened up our european office and you re seeing the benefit that i talked about one is that we just had in that space in europe but i think there is a direct correlation between we present product that inaudible office and making sure that we have really high talent that s focused on globalizing development ramsey el assal barclays analyst great just on the credit roberto simon chief financial officer yes this is roberto let me take the credit loss question for you i mean this is the way we see so we closed 2018 with 12 5 basis points of the spend volume on the fleet credit loss and i ve guided 13 basis points to 18 basis points we don t expect any change from the 18 results with just one exception that is related to the shell and chevron portfolios and here there are two pieces number one this accounts have a small businesses which as you know come with higher credit loss than the average north american fleet business and the second thing is specifically to shell that is our another portfolio that also come with a higher credit loss than the average of the business we have today operator our next question comes from the line of darrin peller from wolfe research your line is open darrin peller wolfe research analyst thanks guys you you continuously show mid single digit growth in your transaction levels in the fleet segment which i guess just give us a little more update on what you re seeing that s driving that level versus what we see industry at some of your competitors is it and then just maybe expand on sustainability to that as we get more organic going forward melissa smith president and chief executive officer yes when we think about growth in that part of the business there s a lot of blocking tackling as we continue to roll our products we had sales people that are selling against both our partner portfolios and then directly over time as we ve added partners it might be counterintuitive but it actually help builds the ability to grow in the marketplace because you have customers who have many different options and there is something unique about each brand and we market to make sure that we re really be thoughtful about what people are attracted to about that brand and maybe try to accept them maybe something around brand loyalty that you noted a whole host of reasons that people pick a particular product but that s an area of expertise of ours is to really understand what is going to drive somebody to that product to make sure that we are marketing to that and at the same time we have a lot of offering which gets inaudible if that s something that they re interested in alternatively and if you look across our partner portfolios we had really great growth year this year on behalf of our partners working in conjunction with them and then the universal business has done well on the over the road business and talked about having one of the biggest implementations in the history of the overall business i think this reached for the good momentum behind the fact that the technology was always good but we really added on to that with new products and features that s resonating in the marketplace darrin peller wolfe research analyst all right thanks melissa you ve mentioned i think 800 million gallons expected to roll on associated with chevron and shell for the year first of all is that still on target and then just quick update on the trend on the overall integration and bringing those clients on how is it going melissa smith president and chief executive officer that is still that is still actually the target for us and we have rolled out the card but what will happen with the customer they now have two cards in hand they had over periods where we re starting to migrate those customers onto our platforms they have to go through a process if they re interested in being on using our online tools which a lot of people are then they have to go through an activation process but also process of getting online and so we re in the thick of that right now but we re seeing that migration happen we talked before about having those tranches executed by the first half of this year and we re still on target to do that so very much on target but we re going to point out this new concept of dilution in the first half of the year we tried to talk about that at the end of last year as ideas that we ve got costs that are going to come in advance of when we see revenue and that s very normal process we go through private label implementation it s a little bit abnormal to have two stack up of this size and inaudible accentuated than it normally would be but the costs are there the sales people are out selling these new products the customers have cards and the tranches are converting over we re seeing some volume coming through now and so we feel very much on track to what we said on our call darrin peller wolfe research analyst okay right guys thanks operator our next question comes from the line of bob napoli from william blair your line is open bob napoli william blair analyst thank you and good afternoon first on the healthcare business with the acquisition of discovery benefits wex has well stated over the years has increased its investment in healthcare now this is a the discovery benefits i think that business was growing at a high rate if you can but it does bring up some questions of whether there is some conflict channel conflict between discovery benefits and your other partners but if you could just talk a little bit about the investment in discovery benefits and healthcare business and the high teens growth that you re are you seeing more of that from a product basis hsa fsa so it s kind of a broad question there conflict of interest and just the overall healthcare business sorry melissa smith president and chief executive officer actually i d like to know that s great i d like it actually inaudible after that last question when we think about most channels there is something that we do in every part of our business and we re very conscious about how we go into a marketplace and how we make sure that we re transparent i mean when it comes down to going into a marketplace with partners and directly a lot of it s around creating rules of engagement and being transparent with people around what you re going to do and making sure you follow through that and we have a very rich and deep history of making sure that we are supporting our partners well at the same time having direct products and as we think about this space a part of what we were interested in with dbi you also had a growth rate and that s certainly part of what it interesting to us as they are growing at a rate higher than core healthcare business shortly and at the same time it adds product extension we can sell some of the products that they have to our existing partners that they have an ability to use that to the marketplace we can share best practices with some of what they re doing that we think that s unique with our partners into the marketplace and then we have an ability to have an offering that is integrated into the marketplace and we like that we like that as a setup in the background that we need to be able to show our partners in the marketplace that we can do that so from a cost perspective that s something we intend to continue to work through with our partners and the way that we have in every other part of the business and in terms of our interest in growth in this marketplace it is got some great tailwinds behind it we d like just the market dynamics we like the size of the market we think that it is a market that healthcare in general is being as complicated it s a place that we think that we can help and you asked about growth it s kind of coming all over the place and people think of hsa account as not growing but they actually do they just grow at a lower rate and then you see over sized growth on hsa side of the market pricing and it comes from adding new partners spend volume going up and the partners that we have continue to grow combination of all those things bob napoli william blair analyst thank you my follow up question would be just on the economy i mean you saw fedex report some weaker news the federal reserve today said they re not going to raise rates anymore so there are signs of global softness but it doesn t sound like i mean you certainly didn t call out i guess same store sales were little weaker but what are you seeing as far as the what s your view on the economy melissa smith president and chief executive officer same store sales were negative 0 4 i d say it really didn t see a significant change and that was in period we had the government shutdown the primary latency is just letting through as volume trends so from our perspective there isn t really been remains much of a change and what we re seeing for activity in the market and we think that our fleet business is pretty good pretty good deal if we do the business inaudible bob napoli william blair analyst okay so you re not seeing any slowdown in the economy nothing that s worrying you and just if i could just sneak in the first quarter guidance and i know you talked about the dilution but is that shell chevron can you quantify the eps dilution in the first quarter roberto simon chief financial officer so bob this is roberto obviously i m not going to get a specific on how much is shell and chevron for the quarter but if you position what we have been saying in the past few calls i mean those portfolios as melisa said they are big portfolios they are going to bring a significant amount of revenue and to get them up to speed the boarding cost of this is significant so i wouldn t quantify how much is the amount related to those portfolios but its a significant amount obviously what i think is importance what i would say bob what is important is the confidence on the guidance that we have for the full year which is we have a growth within our long term targets and that s where we want to reinforce that and we are working towards that bob napoli william blair analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jim schneider from goldman sachs your line is open jim schneider goldman sachs analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my question i was wondering if can maybe talk a little bit more about the macro environment you re seeing maybe by geography it sounds like things are still pretty strong in europe but i guess maybe talk about either the difference between the us and europe and specifically your expectations for new sales in europe outside of the new portfolio you ve already talked about the us melissa smith president and chief executive officer yes when we are looking at any of our sales pipeline we break down our year as we go into executing the year we look at what retention rates needs to be by products and by geo and then what we need from new sales coming in and as a i said about that across the world i guess that your question is us marketplace we are right now envisioning its current economic perspective being similar to last year we know that we have these two major implementations that we re executing on so that s a little bit unusual in the backdrop but that doesn t really impact that s not effecting my view of the overall macro and then in europe and asia i d say similarly we ve had really significant growth in those marketplaces during 20018 albeit off basis but we don t envision that change in when we look at how much we re going to bring in 2019 there is a little bit more lumpiness as you bring in one large account i talked about that can cause a little bit more lumpiness just because of the size of the business but in terms of new wins and what we re seeing in the pipeline we feel pretty good across any of these markets and we said that brazil is being the one standout and the fact that we are expecting to have headwinds there this year which is something we talked about the last two or three calls we envisioned that happen through at least the first half of 19 we would say that again we still think it s going to happen for at least first half of 19 jim schneider goldman sachs analyst that s helpful thank you and then maybe turning to the corporate payments space for a minute clearly continued strength in results there but one of the things that we ve seen from some of your competitors is the acquisition outright of our portfolios for the accounts payable and accounts receivable type management software where you have chosen to rely exclusively on partner strategy can you maybe talk about your appetite for potential additional m a specifically to have your own software solution in the future melissa smith president and chief executive officer so we have if you look at our software now we bought aoc the combination of aoc and what we had prior to that and then inaudible we actually feel pretty good about the underlying product capability and we like the fact that we ve built it using micro services cloud based and we just keep adding to the stack that we have and so when we think about acquisitions i think about in two different ways i think about them in that space technology plays and for us that becomes bills versus buy analysis and we look at that to say are there certain things we need to do in order to build out the product but we like the ability to build on what we ve got and then on the more vertical side of that that s something we will continue to play in the marketplace we ll be interested if someone has a piece of the product or a piece of what they re doing i think it is unique that s comes with a book of business and we will continue to be interested in that as well so we look at both of those things and pretty we also feel pretty good about what we can build upon based on what we ve already acquired and put together so far jim schneider goldman sachs analyst great and then maybe just one clarification if i could clearly there is some dilution on both the new portfolios as well as the acquisitions in the beginning of year as you exit q4 of 2019 will you expect operating margins to be to be up flat or down on a year over year basis roberto simon chief financial officer so let me tell you i mean specifically to those portfolio so obviously when you look at 2019 as we said we expect to be dilutive on the first half and then on the second half we are going to be we expect to be like a fully ramp so what you should expect for 2020 is obviously the full year portfolio is fully combated and obviously when you look 19 to 2020 your margin should be better than 19 because you will have the two fuller halves with the revenue and the cost base alone jim schneider goldman sachs analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani from kbw your line is open analyst analyst inaudible for sanjay thanks for taking my question i guess first i had a quick question on the travel business it seem like you guys announced some good wins there including the etraveli portfolio how should we think about the potential opportunity there and when does that start to ramp in melissa smith president and chief executive officer sure it s starting to ramp now and so it will ramp throughout the year and you you talked about broadly about what we expect to see in the corporate payments business i would restate roberto said we expect it to be in line with our 10 to 15 guidance range our long term guidance range in the course of this year the acquisitions are going to push it down on top of that the organic growth rate and is expected to be between 10 to 15 and then when you aggregate that with acquisitions it would be over 30 analyst analyst thanks for that and i guess a quick clarification on the shell and chevron portfolios we ve had quite a bit of discussion on that already but i guess once you re past the upfront expenses how should we think about the profitability of these portfolios versus the rest of the fleet business roberto simon chief financial officer i will answer to the question for you i mean this is once we have those fully portfolio ramped on a run rate basis the profitability of those two portfolios is going to be very similar to any of the other oil companies that we operate you know that we think the fleet business we have the over the road on the trucking industry side and then when you get more on the fleet north america side you have more fleet you ve larger fleet and when you compare those portfolios within the oil companies the profitability is going to be very similar to the other oil companies that we run analyst analyst got it and if i can squeeze in a last one on discovery benefits i know it s not contributing to earnings this year but i guess going forward how should we think about the accretion expectation on an earnings basis melissa smith president and chief executive officer so what we ve said about dbi we talked about it being immaterial from eps perspective this year we obviously think it is going to continue to grow we talked about it that combined with healthcare we think it will continue to be high teens grower and it will continue to scale we also talked about the fact that we expect to see 20 million worth of synergies that we re going to get over time so if you keep in mind those things we do expect it to look more like a margin profile of their versus healthcare business analyst analyst got it thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of oscar turner from suntrust your line is open oscar turner suntrust analyst yes guys good afternoon first question just on fleet i was wondering did you guys provide the expected revenue contribution from shell and chevron this year apologies if i missed that and just to clarify it sounds like we shouldn t expect to see material revenue contribution until the second half of 19 roberto simon chief financial officer you know we don t disclose revenue or profitability by cost to portfolio but and melissa has just mention a while ago we direction on the number of gallons that those two portfolios will add to our business and if you take these gallons and you translate them into revenue you will have approx 60 million to 70 million in revenue on a full a full year basis so this will give you an idea obviously on whether we should be in 2021 now those two portfolios are fully ramped and obviously you considering the fuel prices that we have today oscar turner suntrust analyst okay thanks then operator our next question comes from the line of matt o neill from autonomous research your line is open matt o neill autonomous research analyst yes hi thanks guys for taking my question actually most of them have been basically asked and answered but i guess if i try to ask on the sort of travel and corporate momentum we saw in the fourth quarter in another way maybe what would you characterize if anything is not being necessarily repeatable if you know we want to think about that kind of levels going forward versus maybe not melissa smith president and chief executive officer i don t think that roberto talked about in his section was around the idea we had the rates were elevated there some of our discount rates and interchange is a little bit higher in the fourth quarter so and he talked about review running outs so that s something that it s something we do expect will repeat throughout the course of this year in terms of spend volume we some of what we will experience depends on what s going happen overall in the travel marketplace because that s still a significant part of the portfolio so we continue to bring on new business how our existing partners perform as pretty big impact and that happens to the overall spend volume roberto talked about expecting that to be mid teens to high teens and of course that 2019 that kind of give an indicator so the raise we expect to be a little bit different than you have seen in q4 but customers spend more and prospectively ph we expect to continue to see volume coming through that will be driven based on existing customers and the performance of those portfolios but also adding in new portfolio if you are looking at growth rates year over year just keep in mind that we get the benefit of bad track in 2018 compared to 2017 so it s a little bit of in terms of revenue matt o neill autonomous research analyst got it thank you for that and then i guess just sort of follow on that and specific to the interchange in that segment trying to think what kind of the overall bias going forward sort of higher or lower i think i m going to guess that it s probably complex or maybe the organic business or the business prior to noventis maybe stable but then with noventis it will wait the average hires volume gets internalized am i thinking about that conceptually correctly roberto simon chief financial officer yes let me let me put this in context for you so as i said that on during the call we expect for 2019 approximately 10 basis points on the net interchange higher than the average of 2018 and there are a couple of reasons number one obviously the acquisition of noventis is going to add a few points to our interchange rates the second thing as i said with one of our ota s we amended the contract there is no impact to total revenue we are doing you will see during the year our reclassification from other revenue into payment processing revenue and the way we calculate the net interchange is based on the processing revenue so that s another reason why you re going to see the rate to go up and then the final thing that you always see more difficult how to manage both the customer spend mix as well as from where the spend comes between domestic and international matt o neill autonomous research analyst okay got it thank you very much for the clarification i appreciated it operator there are no more questions over the phone presenters you may continue steve elder senior vice president global investor relations sorry i couldn t hear you operator but i think that s all the time we have for tonight and we ll look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter thank you

the strike by chicago symphony orchestra cso musicians is now in its second week with management cancelling performances through march 25 little progress in negotiations has been reported and musicians conjecture online that the strike may go on for weeks or months in 1982 the chicago musicians conducted a 21 day strike and a 15 day strike in 1991 the board of the cso which is chaired by helen zell the wife of real estate tycoon and billionaire sam zell has demanded that musicians move from a defined benefit pensions plan to a defined contribution plan which would tie the fate of their retirements to the stock market management has also proposed a wage increase of a mere five percent over a three year contract amounting to a pay cut when adjusted for inflation while the musicians are fighting against concessions by management on their pay and pensions the democratic party and the trade unions feign support for the strike despite their empty words there has been a bipartisan assault on arts culture and education funding by both democrats and republicans for more than two decades in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis massive pay cuts and concessions were imposed at symphony orchestras in phoenix houston cincinnati seattle indianapolis milwaukee detroit baltimore atlanta virginia north carolina and utah among other cities and states the financial elite and corporations have drastically reduced their funding for arts and cultural organizations making access to culture increasingly expensive for broad sections of the population on tuesday the chicago federation of musicians local 10 208 which bargains for the cso musicians held an arts community rally the rally was attended by approximately 100 people and featured speeches by officials from various unions including those covering artists musicians and actors bob reiter the president of the chicago federation of labor which includes 300 unions and 500 000 members in the chicago metropolitan area referred to himself as the embodiment of the chicago labor movement reiter stated if you want to come after them come after all of us this is empty demagogy in fact reiter and the various trade unions have no interest in mobilizing the working class to defend the cso musicians or anyone else for that matter later the same day various democratic party politicians appeared at the picket for a photo op including jan schakowsky robin kelly jesus chuy garcia and danny davis they read a letter of support from speaker of the house nancy pelosi pelosi wrote it is critical that you and all american workers have a chance to build a stable future for yourselves and your children democrats are committed to ensuring that every worker has the freedom to fight for higher wages better working conditions quality health care benefits and the dignity of a good retirement that you have earned pelosi a multimillionaire has helped oversee more than three decades of cuts to arts and education funding under the leadership of the democratic party while trillions have been given to bail out wall street and to fund criminal wars of aggression across the globe despite the phony claims of support from the unions and the democratic party there exists widespread and genuine support among workers students and young people in chicago and around the world for the fight of the renowned cso musicians sam a young worker chose to attend the rally when he heard about the attack on the musicians pensions he told wsws reporters that his father had worked at a paper company but after the company changed owners the pension fund dried up i fully support the musicians sam said the rich survive and the poor don t a pair of cso musicians who wished to be anonymous for fear of retaliation by management also spoke about their reasons for going on strike we don t see a lack of interest in classical music said one musician when people come to our concerts we see a very diverse crowd yes we see a lot of gray hair but we also see a lot of young people on dates it s very diverse because it s a universal language that speaks to humankind art is what makes us human another musician added the cso is one of the top orchestras in the whole world and i think this is about maintaining standards for musicians arts and culture in the country and globally a wsws reporter pointed out that the 2019 federal funding to the national endowment for the arts nea is 155m roughly the cost of one f 35 fighter to which one orchestra member replied it s a pretty sad statement about the priorities of the country we live in top tier orchestra musicians often spend tens of thousands of dollars on their instruments as well as on training and advanced degrees in a time honored ploy cso management along with the right wing chicago tribune owned previously by billionaire zell have attempted to use the fact that musicians earn more than other sections of workers to turn the public against them late last week the cso released an online statement slandering the musicians for being overcompensated compared to other large american city orchestras any argument that the musicians are overpaid should be rejected with contempt while there are differences between workers who make poverty wages in chicago and the musicians who make more than six figures the real issue is the war waged by the financial aristocracy on education and culture at large and against every section of the working population in a teleconference with reporters stacie frank the orchestra s chief financial officer and vice president of the cso board tacitly admitted the organization wishes to pass off the volatility of the stock market onto the shoulders of musicians by freezing their traditional pension and moving them to a direct contribution plan this would create a second tier of musicians that only has the direct contribution plan a tactic that has been used in other union contracts as a bargaining chip to divide workers in future negotiations in a video statement posted on the cso website helen zell spoke like an aristocrat surveying her property we all feel terrible that we can t go to concerts that we are deprived of this pleasure i don t think people realize how important it is today to have a fiscal house that is well managed historically people never asked those questions today they ask them all the time so in order to keep our world class orchestra and our world class city we are going to have to make sure that our fiscal house is in order this lecture on fiscal responsibility is from the wife of asset stripper sam zell sam earned the nickname grave dancer for his history of buying distressed or undervalued businesses in 2007 he purchased the tribune company using debt along with an employee stock ownership plan while only contributing 315 million of his own money the company s discretionary matching contributions to the 401 k retirement plan for nonunionized tribune employees were diverted into an ownership stake less than a year later the tribune saddled with 13 8 billion in debt filed for bankruptcy on the teleconference helen zell once again reiterated that it would be irresponsible for the board to continue to authorize a pension program that jeopardizes the orchestra s and the musicians future there is no proof that the musicians pensions are in any way jeopardizing the future of the world renowned and otherwise financially stable orchestra the real threat to the orchestra and similar cultural institutions across the globe is the dependence on the financial oligarchy for funding the cso confrontation expresses a stark reality the survival and progress of art is incompatible with the corporate stranglehold over every major aspect of life the wealth exists in abundance to fund arts education in the us and provide artists and musicians with economic security but that wealth is hoarded by a handful of modern day financial aristocrats three of whom have more wealth than the bottom half of the country the chicago symphony orchestra strike is not simply a trade union conflict but a political and cultural struggle with enormous implications there is wide support and sympathy for the musicians among workers teachers students and youth the only genuine answer to the attacks on the orchestra musicians lies in conscious opposition to the attacks of the corporate elite and by mobilizing the working class in the fight to defend art culture and every social right

operations as well as other immaterial corrections we identified during our review roberto will give some more details but the changes to our preliminary 2019 guidance are not related to the issues we corrected for our performance in 2018 was guided by the strategic pillars we set years ago that serve as the guide for our business remain committed to building upon our best in class growth engine leading to superior technology delivering scale through superior execution and leveraging our culture to attract and retain the best employees executing against these pillars has allowed us to post another outstanding year underscored by record revenue new and innovative products and strategic m a that has expanded our penetration into the high growth and dynamic corporate payments in consumer directed healthcare market the progress made in 2018 is a testament to our ability to gain market share by deepening existing relationship building new partnerships and delivering high quality service and innovative technologies through our expanding customer base while executing on our acquisition strategy for long term growth we continue to have significant new segment wins and contract renewals in the fourth quarter in fleet solutions revenue grew 15 driven by higher volume growth increased late fees and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds including higher fuel prices our strong track record of new contract wins and partnership renewals gained momentum in 2018 for example we signed new fleet contracts with railcrew xpress and aeromar canada and also renewed significant contracts with element financial and enterprise rental in the over the road business we had one of our best implementation quarters in the history of the business including horizon transport and csi ph we also made significant progress on the implementation and integration of several large prior contract wins most notably shell and chevron portfolio those conversions are progressing and i m pleased to report that the new wex card have been issued to all customers of the two portfolios we re now in a transition period as customers convert to the new products and the accounts receivable balances pull over to us which we expect it to be complete in the next several months we remain well positioned to win new business and generate organic revenue growth our best in class marketing and sales teams are helping us to capture additional market share in addition to wins and renewals the service and support we provide our customers day in and day out truly differentiates us from our peers one example of this is our exxonmobil portfolio which has had one of its best years ever in terms of new account growth in the us in travel and corporate solutions we closed the year with an impressive 29 increase in revenue during q4 this was driven by strengthening our relationships with industry leading online travel agencies while penetrating further into the rapidly growing corporate payment space with 8 2 billion in purchase volume this quarter which is an increase of more than 800 million over last year approximately 45 of this increase came in our corporate payment business in addition to our own sales effort our partnership strategy has proven to be successful and strong revenue driver for us one of these partners is american express and we signed an agreement in q3 for the use of our technology platform we are still in the early stages of this relationship we re beginning to see increasing volumes as we get the program up and running we also had a handful of significant contract wins and renewals during the fourth quarter one that i m excited to announce is the signing of swedish based etraveli one of the largest of otas in europe in the top 15 globally travel and corporate payments remains an important area for our future growth given the size and the underlying growth dynamics in the market while we ve had more than 34 billion in purchase volume during 2018 there is still ample room for growth and we look forward to these opportunities in the coming year as i mentioned in the november investor day corporate payments will be a key area of focus for us in 2019 and beyond moving onto the health and employee benefit solutions our us healthcare business was robust and posted topline growth of more than 12 in the quarter and 14 for the full year in health we saw a successful open enrollment season with the volume of transactions up 18 year over year we closed 2018 with over 65 new or renewed partners the service we offer our partners sets us apart from our competition and we continue to see 50 growth in utilization of our mobile app in online partner portal these tools continue to enhance the partner experience and constant innovation exceeded the success in this market turning to new signings and renewals we re pleased to announce we have signed associated bank nova stanley benefits boyu financial in the fourth quarter in additions to renewing a number of meaningful contracts we now have more than 28 million consumers on the wex health cloud platform i d like to delve a little deeper in our second strategic pillar and the bedrock of our business wex s superior technology we spent a significant amount of time over the past year adopting a cloud first development process which we talked about at length in november during q4 we began migrating our fleet technology platform to the cloud this is the first of many conversions over the next couple of years we are making great progress with little disruption to our customers inaudible fleet segment we re making progress towards consolidating processing platforms and has eliminated one platform this year we plan to continue with this consolidation strategy we are also migrating the processing of our travel product one to an internal cloud based virtual card platform we call tag which was acquired as part of the 2017 aoc acquisition we re starting to move our us business onto tag and we have already processed over 1 5 billion of transactions on a run rate basis in q4 this too is completed with little to no disruption to our customers as we talked about in our investor day in november these moves to the cloud will allow us to improve performance of stability increase the pace of product development and eventually deliver significant cost savings which we are starting to see in our 2019 guidance since we last spoke we ve acquired discovery benefits one of the fastest growing benefits solution providers in the marketplace with operations in all 50 states we re particularly excited about this transaction as it expands our penetration into the attractive high growth consumer directed healthcare market aligns with our growth strategy including further diversifying the business away from fuel complements and enhances our value proposition in the marketplace and provide significant cost synergies with long term upside potential ultimately we believe this transaction strengthens wex s position as a leading provider of innovative healthcare technology solution with greater size scale and capability we plan to successfully leverage our core technologies to improve our competitiveness in the pbh market and are strong platform for future acquisitions before i wrap up my remarks i also wanted to provide an update on the noventis acquisition we closed in january as a reminder they are an electronic payment network and optimize the payment delivery process through their patented scalable technology it complements our current offerings with new payment delivery capabilities that enhance ap payments and provide seamless delivery of electronic payments this acquisition expands wex reach as a corporate payments supplier who provides more channels to billing aggregators and financial institutions we re on schedule to fully integrate noventis into the wex corporate payments platform by the end of this year we are very excited about the new opportunities that we expect to capture in years ahead as i look back at 2018 i m very pleased that we will be able to execute against all of our strategic pillars we ve had revenue and earnings per share growth in line with our long term target we again achieved recognition with great place to work it s rated by almost 90 of all wex employees who filled out the survey finally this year marked a year of significant technology milestone for wex we re excited to see what s next as we expand our capabilities we ve had huge wins in the marketplace like shell and chevron we had a very successful execution of the aoc integration which surpassed our initial expectations we ve undertaken and made significant progress on digital transformation of our business all while maintaining a corporate culture that force our competitive advantage in summary i m very pleased with our performance in 2018 i m proud of the foundation we ve built for our investments over the past few years that will support long term growth and value creation most of all i m thankful to all of our employees who are successfully executing on our strategic pillars and are the backbone of our company we remain poised for growth in 2019 and i look forward to another successful year for wex i d now like to turn the call over to our cfo roberto simon roberto roberto simon chief financial officer thank you and good afternoon everyone as melissa mentioned earlier i will like to provide you with an update on wex s internal financial statement review in addition the recently filed 10 k 10 k a and press release contain updates to the preliminary results issued on february 22 2019 during the company s 2018 year end close process wex identified immaterial errors in the financial statements of our brazilian subsidiary which began before 2015 and are primarily related to accounts receivable and accounts payable the financial statements have been corrected for these matters at the same time we revised the financial statements to correct other immaterial variances impacting prior years that were not previously recorded wex believes that the effects of the provision is not material to our previously issued consolidated financial statements we are actively engaged in the implementation of our remediation plan to ensure that controls are designed appropriately and will operate effectively changing gears to the 2018 results i want to pause for a moment to discuss the results for the full year in 2018 wex outperform again with revenue growth of 20 and adjusted net income growth of 56 when compared to 2017 we had significant organic revenue growth in the business supplement with the m a activity in the fleet segment revenue grew 18 10 of this relates to macro economic factors and revenue recognition in the travel and corporate solutions segment revenue grew 35 approximately half of this growth was due to m a and revenue recognition finally the us health business grew 14 now let s move to the q4 results we had a strong organic revenue and adjusted net income growth driven by robust results from fleet solutions and travel and corporate solutions segment the us healthcare business also performed better than expected with solid revenue growth from an earnings point of view we continue to benefit from these organic growth positive macroeconomic trends and a lower tax rate overall we are pleased with the fourth quarter performance on both top and bottom line results for the fourth quarter of 2018 our total revenue was 381 2 million 15 increase over the prior year non gaap adjusted net income was 91 8 million or 2 11 per diluted share up 34 from 1 57 in line with guidance i want to quickly point out that we are still benefiting from the new revenue recognition standards the total benefit was 10 9 million which is similar to prior quarters now on to the segment results the fleet solutions segment achieved 253 8 million in revenue an increase of 15 compared to prior year payment processing revenue increased 35 and finance fee revenue increased 10 the gains were led by the north america fleets business which grew 14 followed by the over the road which grew 22 both of these growth rates benefited from higher steel prices and the new revenue recognition standards we also saw a strong growth rate in asia at 59 and europe at 15 within the fleet segment we continue to see solid organic transaction growth of 6 5 driven by new sales at the same time we continue to maintain very low attrition rates and finally same store sales were marginally negative due in part to the government shutdown the net interchange rate in q4 was 138 basis points which was up 20 basis points over last year there are three items that had a positive impact on the rate year to date revenue reclassification higher steel ph spreads from the european operations and the revenue recognition changes finally in the segment the average domestic fuel price in q4 was 2 94 versus 2 68 in 2017 we have approximately 13 5 million of additional revenue versus prior year due to higher fuel prices including spread impact in europe turning to our travel and corporate solutions segment we finished the year with the same strong momentum that we had all year total revenue for the quarter increased 29 versus last year which was almost all organic total purchase volume issued by wex reached 8 2 billion this represents 11 organic growth and excludes aoc customers within the us the travel business remained steady with revenue growth of 13 and the corporate payment business was very strong with revenue growth exceeding 100 lastly the international business growth was led by europe brazil and australia the net interchange rate in the fourth quarter was 64 basis points which was 11 basis points higher compared to q4 2017 the increase was due to customer volume mix domestic and international spend mix and lower rebates moving on to health and employee benefit segment the us health business surpassed expectations again growing 12 year over year and continues to support vigorous growth momentum the average number of such accounts was up 17 and total purchase volume was up 12 the volume of transactions during open enrollment season was up 18 over the prior year and the pipeline remains strong in the long term we continue to expect high teens growth in this business as expected we continue to see significant low bound ph in the brazilian benefits business as a result revenue in the health and employee benefits solutions segment decreased 4 in the quarter let s now move to expenses for the quarter total cost of service expenses were 137 6 million up from 126 4 million in q4 last year total sg a depreciation and amortization expenses would have 149 8 million which is up 18 1 million breaking down the line items within these categories processing costs increased 7 7 million primarily due to aoc and the onboarding costs or shell on chevron service fees was down 1 7 million mainly due to the reclassification of network fees as part of the revenue recognition changes revenue loss during the quarter was 16 1 million up from 13 5 million a year ago we recorded 1 3 million expense related to the brazil benefit business in the fleet segment credit loss was at the low end of the guidance coming in at 12 2 basis points of the spend volume operating interest was 10 1 million this is in line with expectations and was mostly due to higher fuel prices and interest rates g a expenses were up 6 3 million for acquisition related costs and legal expenses finally sales and marketing expenses were up 18 5 million largely due to the new revenue recognition and the on boarding costs for shell and chevron now on onto discuss taxes on a gaap basis the effective tax rate this quarter was 44 3 on a non gaap basis ani tax rate was 25 compared to 36 a year ago the company continued to benefit from the tax reform i will now be discussing our balance sheet we ended the quarter with 541 million in cash up from 504 million at the end of last year our corporate cash balance at year end stands at 181 million after making the payment related to the acquisition of the chevron portfolio additionally we have approximately 666 million available on the revolving line of credit which give us access to more than 800 million in capital also at year end we had a total balance 2 1 billion on the revolving line of credit term loans and notes the leverage ratio at the timing of our credit agreement stands at approximately 3 1 times down from 3 7 times at the end of last year as a reminder we have been delevering as expected since the time of ess acquisition at the rate of half a turn to three quarters of a turn per year during january we announced that we can increase borrowing capacity and improved our financial covenants in order to fund acquisitions when we pro forma for the noventis and dbi transactions we expect the leverage ratio to be approximately four times we continue to see unrealized gains on the interest rate hedges we have in place as of quarter end the market value of those hedges was 18 million we have 250 million of hedges rolling off at the end of 2018 during march this year we had secured another 450 million of interest rate hedges locking in libor at approximately 240 basis points including the debt from the dbi and noventis deals we expect to have about 65 of our financing debt balance essentially at fixed interest rates finally let s look at our guidance note that these expectations reflect our views as of today and are made on a non gaap basis with respect to adjusted net income before we get into the numbers i want to give you some puts and takes that should be considered when modeling 2019 first and most important the guidance is within our long term targets of 10 to 15 growth in revenue and 15 to 20 growth in earnings these targets assume constant fuel prices and fx rates starting with the fleet segment our 2019 plan are notably higher then the long term targets provided at the investor day for three key factors first we look to maintain a strong transaction growth rates second we anticipate to fully benefit from the shell and chevron portfolios in the second half of the year and third we look forward to continued progress in the international businesses specific to the shell and chevron win i want to give you some details around the progression through the year as melisa said we have mailed out to all of the customers and we are beginning to see them transition on to our platform it will take several months for this transition to be complete meanwhile we are carrying significant costs as we did at the end of 2018 so we expect the two portfolios to be diluted towards first half of the year and move to normal profitability when fully compared in the second half of the year and beyond finally in this segment we anticipate that fuel prices will be lower than 2018 negatively impacting revenue by approximately 50 million moving into the travel and corporate solutions segment revenue is expected to grow in excess of 30 including approximately 35 million from the noventis acquisition excluding noventis we expect the revenue will be within our long term guidance range of 10 to 15 growth we also expect organic volume to grow in the mid to high teens turning to the net interchange rate for the full year we expect the rate to increase approximately 10 basis points versus the full year rate in 2018 the main reasons for the increase are the acquisition of noventis and the renegotiation of ots contract which will shape revenue from other revenue to payment processing revenue regarding the health and employee benefits segment we expect our us health business to grow revenue in the high teens in line with expectations said at investor day additionally we expect approximately 75 million in revenue as a result of the dbi acquisition which closed earlier this month as we said when we announced the deal we do not expect a material impact on earnings this year in the brazil benefits business we expect another challenging year moving on to the financing side we are assuming an increase in libor of approximately 40 basis points on average from 2018 this increase would impact approximately 900 million of floating rate debt which includes the debt for dbi and noventis in addition we have approximately 1 2 billion in deposits at our bank that will also be impacted by the higher interest rates now for our guidance numbers we have updated our revenue range by 50 million from our previously issued revenue guidance this includes an increase of approximately 75 million for dbi this is also includes at 25 million reduction from noventis after concluding how the new revenue recognition standards will place to these transaction for the full year we expect revenue to be in the range of 1 68 billion to 1 72 billion and adjusted net income in the range 385 million to 403 million on an eps basis we expect adjusted net income to be between 8 80 and 9 20 per diluted share for the first quarter we expect revenue to be in the range of 375 million to 380 million our adjusted net income to be in the range of 72 million to 74 million on an eps basis we expect adjusted net income to be between 1 64 and 1 70 per diluted share now let me inaudible exchange rates are based as of mid february 2019 we assume that domestic steel prices will average 2 60 in the first quarter and 2 63 for the full year these assumption for the us is based on the applicable nymex future price from the week of february 18 the fleet credit loss will be between 13 basis points and 18 basis points both for the first quarter of the full year the company expects its 2019 adjusted net income tax rate for the full year to be between 24 5 and 26 and finally we are assuming that there will be approximately 43 9 million shares outstanding for the year to conclude we are very confident about 2019 guidance and are looking forward to a great year and now we are opening the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ramsey el assal from barclays your line is open ramsey el assal barclays analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question can you give us a little more color on the brazil situation sort of what happened there exactly was it just an accounting error but there is no indication of any type of malfeasance or anything like that or willfulness statements as of past results this is just simply an error that you ve cleared up and now it is completely behind you if you could provide a little more color there would be appreciated roberto simon chief financial officer so this is roberto good afternoon the majority of issues we found in the brazil fleet was our fleet business the process is you know where highly manual and in the past two years we have been improving both processes overtime and the other thing i would say to you is that finally the volume on this particular segment has climbed significantly in the past two years so this is why you know as we look into 2019 we feel comfortable on where we are melissa smith president and chief executive officer it is melissa i make sure that we respond to your second question one of the things we did as part of the process was we engaged one of the big four firms to perform work for us and we did not find any evidence of fraud or intended ph errors by that process so things are absolutely clear ramsey el assal barclays analyst okay that s super helpful thanks so much i wanted to ask also about your corporate payments growth rate which was extraordinary can you give us a little more color in terms of what industry verticals there are driving that or solutions you have that are driving that and also just bolted onto that it looks like your credit loss expectations for 2019 or little higher than your full year 2018 outlook and i was just curious as to what the what is causing that to be elevated a little bit is it increases is it on the credit side rather in fraud side or any color there could help as well and then i ll hop back in the queue melissa smith president and chief executive officer yes sure roberto actually gave some pretty good color of the corporate payment side we actually if you look across the portfolio we saw great growth but we saw over sized growth in some of the areas like the corporate payments inaudible and more we think of the business we re segmenting it between travel and corporate payment government payments it is a bigger market it s the higher growth rates and we ve been putting an increasing amount of capital and efforts towards that space so that s a piece of it we are going of relatively small base which helps but that piece of it also growth outside of united states as the business continue to globalize we ve added and really strengthened up our european office and you re seeing the benefit that i talked about one is that we just had in that space in europe but i think there is a direct correlation between we present product that inaudible office and making sure that we have really high talent that s focused on globalizing development ramsey el assal barclays analyst great just on the credit roberto simon chief financial officer yes this is roberto let me take the credit loss question for you i mean this is the way we see so we closed 2018 with 12 5 basis points of the spend volume on the fleet credit loss and i ve guided 13 basis points to 18 basis points we don t expect any change from the 18 results with just one exception that is related to the shell and chevron portfolios and here there are two pieces number one this accounts have a small businesses which as you know come with higher credit loss than the average north american fleet business and the second thing is specifically to shell that is our another portfolio that also come with a higher credit loss than the average of the business we have today operator our next question comes from the line of darrin peller from wolfe research your line is open darrin peller wolfe research analyst thanks guys you you continuously show mid single digit growth in your transaction levels in the fleet segment which i guess just give us a little more update on what you re seeing that s driving that level versus what we see industry at some of your competitors is it and then just maybe expand on sustainability to that as we get more organic going forward melissa smith president and chief executive officer yes when we think about growth in that part of the business there s a lot of blocking tackling as we continue to roll our products we had sales people that are selling against both our partner portfolios and then directly over time as we ve added partners it might be counterintuitive but it actually help builds the ability to grow in the marketplace because you have customers who have many different options and there is something unique about each brand and we market to make sure that we re really be thoughtful about what people are attracted to about that brand and maybe try to accept them maybe something around brand loyalty that you noted a whole host of reasons that people pick a particular product but that s an area of expertise of ours is to really understand what is going to drive somebody to that product to make sure that we are marketing to that and at the same time we have a lot of offering which gets inaudible if that s something that they re interested in alternatively and if you look across our partner portfolios we had really great growth year this year on behalf of our partners working in conjunction with them and then the universal business has done well on the over the road business and talked about having one of the biggest implementations in the history of the overall business i think this reached for the good momentum behind the fact that the technology was always good but we really added on to that with new products and features that s resonating in the marketplace darrin peller wolfe research analyst all right thanks melissa you ve mentioned i think 800 million gallons expected to roll on associated with chevron and shell for the year first of all is that still on target and then just quick update on the trend on the overall integration and bringing those clients on how is it going melissa smith president and chief executive officer that is still that is still actually the target for us and we have rolled out the card but what will happen with the customer they now have two cards in hand they had over periods where we re starting to migrate those customers onto our platforms they have to go through a process if they re interested in being on using our online tools which a lot of people are then they have to go through an activation process but also process of getting online and so we re in the thick of that right now but we re seeing that migration happen we talked before about having those tranches executed by the first half of this year and we re still on target to do that so very much on target but we re going to point out this new concept of dilution in the first half of the year we tried to talk about that at the end of last year as ideas that we ve got costs that are going to come in advance of when we see revenue and that s very normal process we go through private label implementation it s a little bit abnormal to have two stack up of this size and inaudible accentuated than it normally would be but the costs are there the sales people are out selling these new products the customers have cards and the tranches are converting over we re seeing some volume coming through now and so we feel very much on track to what we said on our call darrin peller wolfe research analyst okay right guys thanks operator our next question comes from the line of bob napoli from william blair your line is open bob napoli william blair analyst thank you and good afternoon first on the healthcare business with the acquisition of discovery benefits wex has well stated over the years has increased its investment in healthcare now this is a the discovery benefits i think that business was growing at a high rate if you can but it does bring up some questions of whether there is some conflict channel conflict between discovery benefits and your other partners but if you could just talk a little bit about the investment in discovery benefits and healthcare business and the high teens growth that you re are you seeing more of that from a product basis hsa fsa so it s kind of a broad question there conflict of interest and just the overall healthcare business sorry melissa smith president and chief executive officer actually i d like to know that s great i d like it actually inaudible after that last question when we think about most channels there is something that we do in every part of our business and we re very conscious about how we go into a marketplace and how we make sure that we re transparent i mean when it comes down to going into a marketplace with partners and directly a lot of it s around creating rules of engagement and being transparent with people around what you re going to do and making sure you follow through that and we have a very rich and deep history of making sure that we are supporting our partners well at the same time having direct products and as we think about this space a part of what we were interested in with dbi you also had a growth rate and that s certainly part of what it interesting to us as they are growing at a rate higher than core healthcare business shortly and at the same time it adds product extension we can sell some of the products that they have to our existing partners that they have an ability to use that to the marketplace we can share best practices with some of what they re doing that we think that s unique with our partners into the marketplace and then we have an ability to have an offering that is integrated into the marketplace and we like that we like that as a setup in the background that we need to be able to show our partners in the marketplace that we can do that so from a cost perspective that s something we intend to continue to work through with our partners and the way that we have in every other part of the business and in terms of our interest in growth in this marketplace it is got some great tailwinds behind it we d like just the market dynamics we like the size of the market we think that it is a market that healthcare in general is being as complicated it s a place that we think that we can help and you asked about growth it s kind of coming all over the place and people think of hsa account as not growing but they actually do they just grow at a lower rate and then you see over sized growth on hsa side of the market pricing and it comes from adding new partners spend volume going up and the partners that we have continue to grow combination of all those things bob napoli william blair analyst thank you my follow up question would be just on the economy i mean you saw fedex report some weaker news the federal reserve today said they re not going to raise rates anymore so there are signs of global softness but it doesn t sound like i mean you certainly didn t call out i guess same store sales were little weaker but what are you seeing as far as the what s your view on the economy melissa smith president and chief executive officer same store sales were negative 0 4 i d say it really didn t see a significant change and that was in period we had the government shutdown the primary latency is just letting through as volume trends so from our perspective there isn t really been remains much of a change and what we re seeing for activity in the market and we think that our fleet business is pretty good pretty good deal if we do the business inaudible bob napoli william blair analyst okay so you re not seeing any slowdown in the economy nothing that s worrying you and just if i could just sneak in the first quarter guidance and i know you talked about the dilution but is that shell chevron can you quantify the eps dilution in the first quarter roberto simon chief financial officer so bob this is roberto obviously i m not going to get a specific on how much is shell and chevron for the quarter but if you position what we have been saying in the past few calls i mean those portfolios as melisa said they are big portfolios they are going to bring a significant amount of revenue and to get them up to speed the boarding cost of this is significant so i wouldn t quantify how much is the amount related to those portfolios but its a significant amount obviously what i think is importance what i would say bob what is important is the confidence on the guidance that we have for the full year which is we have a growth within our long term targets and that s where we want to reinforce that and we are working towards that bob napoli william blair analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jim schneider from goldman sachs your line is open jim schneider goldman sachs analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my question i was wondering if can maybe talk a little bit more about the macro environment you re seeing maybe by geography it sounds like things are still pretty strong in europe but i guess maybe talk about either the difference between the us and europe and specifically your expectations for new sales in europe outside of the new portfolio you ve already talked about the us melissa smith president and chief executive officer yes when we are looking at any of our sales pipeline we break down our year as we go into executing the year we look at what retention rates needs to be by products and by geo and then what we need from new sales coming in and as a i said about that across the world i guess that your question is us marketplace we are right now envisioning its current economic perspective being similar to last year we know that we have these two major implementations that we re executing on so that s a little bit unusual in the backdrop but that doesn t really impact that s not effecting my view of the overall macro and then in europe and asia i d say similarly we ve had really significant growth in those marketplaces during 20018 albeit off basis but we don t envision that change in when we look at how much we re going to bring in 2019 there is a little bit more lumpiness as you bring in one large account i talked about that can cause a little bit more lumpiness just because of the size of the business but in terms of new wins and what we re seeing in the pipeline we feel pretty good across any of these markets and we said that brazil is being the one standout and the fact that we are expecting to have headwinds there this year which is something we talked about the last two or three calls we envisioned that happen through at least the first half of 19 we would say that again we still think it s going to happen for at least first half of 19 jim schneider goldman sachs analyst that s helpful thank you and then maybe turning to the corporate payments space for a minute clearly continued strength in results there but one of the things that we ve seen from some of your competitors is the acquisition outright of our portfolios for the accounts payable and accounts receivable type management software where you have chosen to rely exclusively on partner strategy can you maybe talk about your appetite for potential additional m a specifically to have your own software solution in the future melissa smith president and chief executive officer so we have if you look at our software now we bought aoc the combination of aoc and what we had prior to that and then inaudible we actually feel pretty good about the underlying product capability and we like the fact that we ve built it using micro services cloud based and we just keep adding to the stack that we have and so when we think about acquisitions i think about in two different ways i think about them in that space technology plays and for us that becomes bills versus buy analysis and we look at that to say are there certain things we need to do in order to build out the product but we like the ability to build on what we ve got and then on the more vertical side of that that s something we will continue to play in the marketplace we ll be interested if someone has a piece of the product or a piece of what they re doing i think it is unique that s comes with a book of business and we will continue to be interested in that as well so we look at both of those things and pretty we also feel pretty good about what we can build upon based on what we ve already acquired and put together so far jim schneider goldman sachs analyst great and then maybe just one clarification if i could clearly there is some dilution on both the new portfolios as well as the acquisitions in the beginning of year as you exit q4 of 2019 will you expect operating margins to be to be up flat or down on a year over year basis roberto simon chief financial officer so let me tell you i mean specifically to those portfolio so obviously when you look at 2019 as we said we expect to be dilutive on the first half and then on the second half we are going to be we expect to be like a fully ramp so what you should expect for 2020 is obviously the full year portfolio is fully combated and obviously when you look 19 to 2020 your margin should be better than 19 because you will have the two fuller halves with the revenue and the cost base alone jim schneider goldman sachs analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani from kbw your line is open analyst analyst inaudible for sanjay thanks for taking my question i guess first i had a quick question on the travel business it seem like you guys announced some good wins there including the etraveli portfolio how should we think about the potential opportunity there and when does that start to ramp in melissa smith president and chief executive officer sure it s starting to ramp now and so it will ramp throughout the year and you you talked about broadly about what we expect to see in the corporate payments business i would restate roberto said we expect it to be in line with our 10 to 15 guidance range our long term guidance range in the course of this year the acquisitions are going to push it down on top of that the organic growth rate and is expected to be between 10 to 15 and then when you aggregate that with acquisitions it would be over 30 analyst analyst thanks for that and i guess a quick clarification on the shell and chevron portfolios we ve had quite a bit of discussion on that already but i guess once you re past the upfront expenses how should we think about the profitability of these portfolios versus the rest of the fleet business roberto simon chief financial officer i will answer to the question for you i mean this is once we have those fully portfolio ramped on a run rate basis the profitability of those two portfolios is going to be very similar to any of the other oil companies that we operate you know that we think the fleet business we have the over the road on the trucking industry side and then when you get more on the fleet north america side you have more fleet you ve larger fleet and when you compare those portfolios within the oil companies the profitability is going to be very similar to the other oil companies that we run analyst analyst got it and if i can squeeze in a last one on discovery benefits i know it s not contributing to earnings this year but i guess going forward how should we think about the accretion expectation on an earnings basis melissa smith president and chief executive officer so what we ve said about dbi we talked about it being immaterial from eps perspective this year we obviously think it is going to continue to grow we talked about it that combined with healthcare we think it will continue to be high teens grower and it will continue to scale we also talked about the fact that we expect to see 20 million worth of synergies that we re going to get over time so if you keep in mind those things we do expect it to look more like a margin profile of their versus healthcare business analyst analyst got it thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of oscar turner from suntrust your line is open oscar turner suntrust analyst yes guys good afternoon first question just on fleet i was wondering did you guys provide the expected revenue contribution from shell and chevron this year apologies if i missed that and just to clarify it sounds like we shouldn t expect to see material revenue contribution until the second half of 19 roberto simon chief financial officer you know we don t disclose revenue or profitability by cost to portfolio but and melissa has just mention a while ago we direction on the number of gallons that those two portfolios will add to our business and if you take these gallons and you translate them into revenue you will have approx 60 million to 70 million in revenue on a full a full year basis so this will give you an idea obviously on whether we should be in 2021 now those two portfolios are fully ramped and obviously you considering the fuel prices that we have today oscar turner suntrust analyst okay thanks then operator our next question comes from the line of matt o neill from autonomous research your line is open matt o neill autonomous research analyst yes hi thanks guys for taking my question actually most of them have been basically asked and answered but i guess if i try to ask on the sort of travel and corporate momentum we saw in the fourth quarter in another way maybe what would you characterize if anything is not being necessarily repeatable if you know we want to think about that kind of levels going forward versus maybe not melissa smith president and chief executive officer i don t think that roberto talked about in his section was around the idea we had the rates were elevated there some of our discount rates and interchange is a little bit higher in the fourth quarter so and he talked about review running outs so that s something that it s something we do expect will repeat throughout the course of this year in terms of spend volume we some of what we will experience depends on what s going happen overall in the travel marketplace because that s still a significant part of the portfolio so we continue to bring on new business how our existing partners perform as pretty big impact and that happens to the overall spend volume roberto talked about expecting that to be mid teens to high teens and of course that 2019 that kind of give an indicator so the raise we expect to be a little bit different than you have seen in q4 but customers spend more and prospectively ph we expect to continue to see volume coming through that will be driven based on existing customers and the performance of those portfolios but also adding in new portfolio if you are looking at growth rates year over year just keep in mind that we get the benefit of bad track in 2018 compared to 2017 so it s a little bit of in terms of revenue matt o neill autonomous research analyst got it thank you for that and then i guess just sort of follow on that and specific to the interchange in that segment trying to think what kind of the overall bias going forward sort of higher or lower i think i m going to guess that it s probably complex or maybe the organic business or the business prior to noventis maybe stable but then with noventis it will wait the average hires volume gets internalized am i thinking about that conceptually correctly roberto simon chief financial officer yes let me let me put this in context for you so as i said that on during the call we expect for 2019 approximately 10 basis points on the net interchange higher than the average of 2018 and there are a couple of reasons number one obviously the acquisition of noventis is going to add a few points to our interchange rates the second thing as i said with one of our ota s we amended the contract there is no impact to total revenue we are doing you will see during the year our reclassification from other revenue into payment processing revenue and the way we calculate the net interchange is based on the processing revenue so that s another reason why you re going to see the rate to go up and then the final thing that you always see more difficult how to manage both the customer spend mix as well as from where the spend comes between domestic and international matt o neill autonomous research analyst okay got it thank you very much for the clarification i appreciated it operator there are no more questions over the phone presenters you may continue steve elder senior vice president global investor relations sorry i couldn t hear you operator but i think that s all the time we have for tonight and we ll look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter thank you

the decision to go on hold mr powell said economic data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another in my view is likely to put downward pressure on the us currency limiting the ability of other central banks to tighten policy for instance in the face of falling unemployment at the same time emerging markets such as india turkey and brazil can claim a small win from the fed pivot as the policy stall reduces incentives for investors to shift capital into us assets in turn that eases downward pressure on their economies and curbs imported goods inflation allowing their central banks to reverse some of the bruising rate hikes of recent years for the reserve bank of australia which is itself drifting away from a tightening bias even as unemployment falls the fed decision means martin place now has even less scope to increase borrowing costs without risking a stronger australian dollar the magnitude of the change was stunning omair sharif socgen mr powell is not alone in becoming more cautious the european central bank sprung its own surprise earlier this month when it curbed its forecasts and revived a crisis era lending program for banks advertisement olli rhen who heads finland s central bank and is seen as a strong contender to succeed ecb president mario draghi said last week that the central bank should review its policy options and practices because of a worrisome failure to hit the inflation target meanwhile the bank of england will on thursday keep its key rate on hold at 0 75 per cent not least because of uncertainty about britain s departure from the european union china too has been easing policy in the face of domestic weakness and the broader global slowdown welcome to the club said omair sharif a societe generale economist of the fed s shift the magnitude of the change was stunning as nine individuals who had been looking for either one or two hikes in december dropped to zero hikes mr sharif said in just six months the fed has gone from a view towards needing to be in restrictive territory to being slightly accommodative after two days of meetings fed policy makers also lowered their forecast for us gross domestic product growth in 2019 to 2 1 per cent from 2 3 per cent and announced they would in september halt the process of running down the balance sheet built up through post crisis quantitative easing advertisement having closed down the fed s double barrelled tightening strategy of 2018 which culminated in december with the ninth hike in three years mr powell said he would remain patient about the likely path of policy futures markets have moved to price in a rate cut later this year the yield on the us 10 year treasury note plunged 9 basis points to 2 52 per cent in late new york trade while insisting the us economy is in a good place mr powell listed a litany of global risks including brexit weaker growth and concern about consumer spending compared with last year when he anticipated gross domestic product growth of 2 5 per cent in 2019 data arriving from september suggests growth is slowing somewhat more than expected he told reporters in washington the atlanta fed s gdpnow model puts the pace of growth in the current quarter at 0 4 per cent advertisement cementing a rapid shift in perspective in recent months the fed now also expects to raise borrowing costs only once more until 2021 and no longer anticipates the need to guard against inflation with restrictive monetary policy the price of the us 10 year note spiked after the fed policy statement and updated projections bloomberg the fed s outlook for rates economic projections and balance sheet policy are all more dovish than expectations said td securities economist michael hanson the fed detailed its long awaited pledge to slow the monthly reduction of its holdings of treasury bonds from up to us30 billion 42 billion to no more than us15 billion beginning in may it said it would end its balance sheet runoff in september provided the economy and money market conditions evolved as expected redemptions of mortgage backed securities would at that point be reinvested in treasuries up to as much as us20 billion per month moving the fed generally towards a treasuries only approach to its assets advertisement critics warned the fed s decision to effectively give up on its policy normalisation strategy could leave policy makers with less scope to stimulate the us economy if fears of a recession are realised we don t have much ammunition in the fed holster right now said former dallas fed president richard fisher he also criticised the fed s decision to signal no more rate hikes in 2019 something he would have cautioned against were he still sitting at the table that was a pretty radical statement and i m not sure that was a wise thing to do said mr fisher fed policymakers interest rate projections fomc updated quarterly economic projections released by the fed showed weakening on all fronts compared with forecasts from december with unemployment expected to be slightly higher this year inflation edging down and economic growth lower as well advertisement growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter the fed said recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter overall inflation has declined inflation for the year is now seen at 1 8 per cent compared with the fed s forecast in december of 1 9 per cent

adjusted ebitdare ebitdare and ebitda to net income both on a pro forma and historical basis and a reconciliation of ffo and adjusted ffo to net income both on a pro forma and historical basis we believe this financial information provides meaningful supplemental information because it reflects the portion of the la quinta business that was conveyed to corepoint and the ongoing effects of the other spin off related transactions this represents how management views the business and reviews our operating performance it is also used by management when publicly providing the business outlook see the definitions of ebitda ebitdare adjusted ebitdare comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare ffo and adjusted ffo including pro forma adjusted amounts for a further explanation of the use of these measures ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure in many reit and non reit related industries the company believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance because it provides an indication of our ability to incur and service debt to satisfy general operating expenses and to make capital expenditures we calculate ebitda excluding discontinued operations ebitdare the company presents ebitdare in accordance with guidelines established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit nareit defines ebitdare as net income or loss excluding interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization gains or losses on the disposition of property impairments and adjustments to reflect the entity s share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates the company believes ebitdare is a useful performance measure to help investors evaluate and compare the results of the company s operations from period to period ebitdare is intended to be a supplemental non gaap financial measure that is independent of a company s capital structure adjusted ebitdare the company adjusts ebitdare when evaluating its performance because the company believes that the adjustment for certain items such as restructuring and separation transaction expenses acquisition and disposition transaction expenses stock based compensation expense discontinued operations and other items not indicative of ongoing operating performance provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our ongoing operating performance the company believes that ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare provide useful information to investors about it and its financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are among the measures used by the company s management to evaluate its operating performance and make day to day operating decisions and ii ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are frequently used by securities analysts investors lenders and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in and apart from the company s industry sector ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are not recognized terms under gaap have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing the company s results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are that these measures do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the company s working capital needs do not reflect the company s interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on its indebtedness do not reflect the company s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay its taxes do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments do not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that the company considers not to be indicative of our future operations including but not limited to discontinued operations impairment acquisition and disposition activities and restructuring expenses although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated amortized or impaired will often have to be replaced upgraded or repositioned in the future and ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and upgraded or repositioned in the future and ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in the company s industry may calculate ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare differently potentially limiting their usefulness as comparative measures because of these limitations ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare should not be considered as discretionary cash available to the company to reinvest in the growth of its business or as measures of cash that will be available to the company to meet its obligations comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare measures property level results at the company s comparable hotels before corporate level expenses and is a key measure of the hotel s profitability the company presents pro forma hotel adjusted ebitdare to help the company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the company s properties comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare margin represents the ratio of pro forma comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare to pro forma total revenues funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo we present nareit ffo attributable to stockholders and nareit ffo per diluted share defined as set forth below as non gaap measures of our performance we calculate funds from operations ffo attributable to stockholders for a given operating period in accordance with standards established by nareit as net income or loss attributable to stockholders calculated in accordance with gaap excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate gains or losses on sales of certain real estate assets impairment write downs of real estate assets discontinued operations income taxes related to sales of certain real estate assets and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles plus adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance we believe nareit ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits our presentation may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the terms in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during a given operating period we also present adjusted ffo attributable to stockholders and adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance and in our annual budget process we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo attributable to stockholders for the following items and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo attributable to stockholders transaction expense associated with the potential disposition of or acquisition of real estate or businesses severance expense share based compensation expense litigation gains and losses outside the ordinary course of business amortization of deferred financing costs reorganization costs and separation transaction expenses loss on extinguishment of debt straight line ground lease expense casualty losses deferred tax expense and other items that we believe are not representative of our current or future operating performance nareit ffo attributable to stockholders and adjusted ffo attributable to stockholders are not recognized terms under gaap have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under gaap nareit ffo is not an indication of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to fund dividends nareit ffo is also not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining nareit ffo investors are cautioned that we may not recover any impairment charges in the future accordingly nareit ffo should be reviewed in connection with gaap measurements we believe our presentation of nareit ffo is in accordance with the nareit definition however our nareit ffo may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other reits pro forma adjusted ebitdare non gaap reconciliation unaudited in millions three months ended december 31 2018 three

presentation will differ from our gaap diluted shares for the anti dilutive effects when we report a net gaap loss certain defined terms average daily rate adr represents hotel room revenues divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period adr measures the average room price attained by a hotel or group of hotels and adr trends provide useful information concerning pricing policies and the nature of the guest base of a hotel or group of hotels changes in room rates have an impact on overall revenues and profitability occupancy represents the total number of rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases revenue per available room revpar is defined as the product of the adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved revpar does not include other ancillary non room revenues such as food and beverage revenues or parking telephone or other guest service revenues generated by a hotel which are not significant for corepoint revpar changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental hotel operating profit than changes driven predominately by adr for example increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues as well as incremental operating costs including but not limited to housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher adr however would generally not result in additional operating costs with the exception of those charged or incurred as a percentage of revenue such as credit card fees and commissions as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in adr generally have a greater effect on operating profitability than changes in revpar driven by occupancy levels due to seasonality in our business we review revpar by comparing current periods to budget and period over period revpar index measures a hotel s fair market share of its competitive set s revenue per available room comparable hotels are defined as hotels that were active and operating in our portfolio for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the applicable reporting period and were active and operating as of january 1st of the previous year except for i hotels that sustained substantial property damage or other business interruption ii hotels that become subject to a purchase and sale agreement or iii hotels in which comparable results are otherwise not available management uses comparable hotels as the basis upon which to evaluate adr occupancy and revpar between periods for the set of comparable hotels existing at the reporting date versus the results of the same set of hotels in the prior period of the 315 hotels in our portfolio as of december 31 2018 304 have been classified as comparable hotels for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 one hotel located in panama city florida was removed from comparable results following substantial property damage sustained from hurricane michael in october 2018
fed reduces economic and rate projections for 2019 and 2020 dollar drops equities recover then fall interest rates decline powell lauds economy while fed rate policy pauses fomc policy and projections the federal reserve downgraded its view of us growth this year and next officially moved to a neutral rate policy yet kept its optimism about the general state of the american economy which chairman jerome powell referred to several times as in a good place in its closely followed projection materials which the central bank issues four times a year in march june september and december economic growth in 2019 dropped to 2 1 from 2 3 core pce inflation slipped to 1 8 from 1 9 and the estimated fed funds rate at year end fell to 2 4 from 2 9 in the six months since the september release of the same information the fed s estimate for gdp has fallen 0 4 from 2 5 core inflation 0 3 from 2 1 and the fed funds rate has decreased 0 7 to 2 4 from a policy prospective the drop in the fed funds estimate brought the bank s three year old rate hike campaign to a halt in december s materials the 2 9 forecast for 2019 coupled with the 0 25 increase at that meeting meant two more hikes would be needed this year to 3 0 to cover the 2 9 goal the new projections with 2 4 this december which would strictly require one 0 25 reduction from the current 2 5 and 2 6 by december 2020 which would need one or two hikes depending on the action this year imply some possibility for rate flexibility in practice it is a formula for the fed to be inactive through the end of next year the fed also clarified its intentions on the disposition of its balance sheet acquired in the years after the financial crisis of 2008 and recession since 2017 we have been allowing our assets to decline we intend to slow the runoff of assets in may and stop in december said chairman powell in the press conference following the policy announcement market reaction markets reacted swiftly to the change in fed policy the dollar fell sharply losing a figure against the euro to 1 1448 and a figure versus the yen to 110 53 though it regained some of its losses against both currencies into the close equities were whipsawed with the dow initially running higher on the dovish rate news but slipping into the finish closing off 141 71 points 0 55 at 25745 67 the s p 500 lost 8 34 points 0 29 to 2824 23 dow dow cnbc treasury prices moved higher and rates lower with the 10 year yield losing 9 points to 2 53 almost at the bottom of its 52 week range of 2 52 to 3 26 the 2 year lost 7 points of yield to 2 40 its lowest return in almost a year 10 year treasury yield chairman powell in his lengthy news conference stressed the good condition of the us economy the fomc statement said the committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes the closing sentence of that paragraph was unchanged from january in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes is it possible that the international risks cited by the chairman powell brexit the us china trade dispute and slowing global growth resolve themselves by the end of the second quarter and the fed s discretion and patience is rewarded with revived prospects for the us economy chairman powell would probably answer yes but that is not the data we have now
the canadian dollar soared following the more dovish than expected u s federal open market committee fomc policy meeting yesterday the fomc didn t surprise anyone when it left u s interest rates unchanged at 2 ¼ 2 ½ the surprise was that it forecast no rate hikes for 2019 the december dot plot estimates predicted two rate hikes for this year after a series of dovish speeches by fed chair jerome powell and the january 30 fomc statement analysts and economists were predicting that rate hike projections would be reduced from two to one in addition powell didn t come across as decisive but rather unsure he said that the economic data wasn t providing any signals that would suggest a rate move in either direction up or down instead it showed a need for patience he said that the outlook was favourable and predicted economic growth of 2 with inflation hovering around its target level initially fx traders were not impressed they sold u s dollars across the board and they sold aggressively eur usd soared from 1 1346 to 1 1446 immediately following the statement and usd jpy plunged to 110 54 from 111 50 usd cad dropped to 1 3258 after touching 1 3342 mid morning however the euphoria following the fomc faded in asia and european trading the u s recouped a sizable portion of its losses compared to its closing level as traders re evaluated their u s dollar outlook the greenback is still the best of a bad lot as the american economy continues to outperform the european british canadian and japanese economies canadian dollar selling was evident in asia and europe and it continued in early toronto trading traders ignored a steep spike in oil prices west texas intermediate soared from 58 35 to 60 30 u s barrel yesterday due to a combination of a weak u s dollar and a steep drop in weekly crude inventories the energy information administration eia said that weekly crude stocks fell 9 5 million barrels sanctions against venezuela and iran the extension of production cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and fears that demand will outstrip supply in the second half of the year fueled the rally prices retreated from their peak which undermined the canadian dollar in the process the canadian dollar is exposed to risk aversion selling which could become more prominent in the coming days u k prime minister theresa may s request for a three month extension to article 50 may be denied by the european union according to rumours the e u is only willing to delay until may 22 because of the european union member elections that take place the next day today s u s data is only second tier whereas canadian data focuses on employment insurance and wholesale trade rahim madhavji is the president of knightsbridgefx com a canadian currency exchange that provides better rates than the banks to canadians
the region s growth potential may not be as notable as emerging markets in asia but fiona rintoul asks if being overlooked under researched and undervalued make cee markets attractive last year poland was upgraded to developed market status by ftse russell it was the first promotion from advanced emerging to developed market within ftse russell s country classification scheme for nearly a decade so not to be taken lightly but do such endorsements combined with european union eu membership for a whole swathe of central and eastern european cee markets take some of the excitement out of investing in these markets it certainly feels like the cee markets don t get the breathless attention they did ten or 15 years ago have they perhaps been eclipsed by the great juggernaut economies of asia and the resource rich latin american markets and if so is their position in the shade justified for daniel ganev chief executive of karoll capital management in sofia bulgaria the cee markets have not so much been eclipsed or forgotten as never truly discovered he cites research undertaken by his firm in cooperation with a canadian partner into investment in cee by canadian institutional investors out of the top 100 only a couple had any exposure at all to cee the region is overlooked under researched and undervalued he says part of the problem is that poland s elevation by ftse russell notwithstanding fund managers and their clients tend to view cee through an emerging markets lens many global emerging markets funds stick quite closely to benchmark indices and the cee region is very small in those indices less than 2 in the equity sector according to maarten jan bakkum senior markets strategist at nn investment partners global em managers might prefer to spend their time on the bigger markets in asia or latin america or in general on markets with higher potential growth or higher interest rate levels he says another issue is defining the cee universe does it include continent straddling russia and turkey what about the commonwealth of independent states cis as an example karoll capital management s emerging europe opportunities strategy includes the core former ostbloc countries plus others including russia turkey austria and greece numbers to dream of it is karoll capital management s mission to convince investors that they should be allocating more than 2 of what could already be quite a small gem or global emerging markets allocation to cee markets thirty years after the fall of the berlin wall there still remain neglected opportunities says ganev we want to give global investors access to these opportunities in our region certainly the headline numbers in cee markets look good in the first half of 2018 gdp growth in the five core countries of poland the czech republic slovakia hungary and romania was 4 2 according to cee investment report 2018 unemployment was below 5 in all five countries in most cases well below and so was inflation these are numbers western european markets can only dream of and in the report dan bucsa cee chief economist at unicredit highlights four further strengths in the region first it is still cheaper and draws large foreign direct investment flows second it is a major recipient of eu funds third its labour force is much better quality than in other emerging markets fourth it has moved up the global value chains to mid range manufacturing of course there are issues in these markets too a further shift to populism and conservatism after future elections could dampen prospects political change away from the conservative populist revanchist movement towards a more constructive approach promoting open liberal societies would likely help investments and innovation says bakkum then there are the rather different markets of russia and turkey both have lots of problems with sanctions being perhaps the most obvious one in russia and lots of promise in some ways these two large markets are negatives of each other russia has relatively low gdp growth but is stable in terms of macro factors whereas in turkey it s the opposite an unstable economy and gdp growth of over 7 i would argue that russia could be the market to perform in 2019 says jacob grapengiesser head of eastern europe at east capital i m not saying it s going to happen but little by little investors are starting to notice he points to relatively low valuations in russia with sberbank for example trading at 4 6 times earnings the problem is for the market to flourish there needs to be lower volatility on global markets and less political noise as it is the universe in russia has become narrower the spreads between companies have increased says grapengiesser in food retail for example you might have had five different companies growing at 20 30 you still have them but two or three of them are really struggling some will look at these dynamics and wonder about the case for cee it s a heterogenous region and investing there requires informed selectivity not just when it comes to stocks but also markets the cee markets share common drivers such as sensitivity to european demand growth and moves in the euro says bakkum but at the same time the countries have their own political and interest rate cycles if investors want to allocate time to these markets it can pay off to look at them individually and while the cee markets growth numbers generally look good when viewed from london or frankfurt they perhaps don t sparkle quite so brilliantly for viewers in beijing and dehli they are not so exciting from a growth perspective says bakkum long term growth is relatively low due to demographics and the current level of development at the same time the biggest recent trend in non european emerging markets such as china and india the shift away from export led growth to growth based on domestic consumption is propelling the cee markets too driven by higher disposable income this creates a new kind of opportunity the pattern of macro development is shifting says nadia nedelcheva chief investment officer at karoll capital management essentially it all comes down to human capital low labour and overall costs have attracted new companies to the region but in cee a low cost workforce doesn t mean a low quality workforce labour costs in cee are around 50 cheaper than in developed europe but the workforce is equally if not better qualified right now the region finds itself in that happy place where it is cheap but not too cheap labour costs are growing across the whole region but we still have a competitive advantage says nedelcheva knowledge growth the quality of the workforce also means the region has somewhere to go when that competitive advantage diminishes as the cee investment report 2018 notes cee is in the midst of a very important business transition from economic growth which is based on wage competitiveness to growth which is based on knowledge there are perhaps some gaps but they are being filled something that is not happening on a large scale yet is creation of technology although we do see this in some places for example car manufacturers have developed a few r d centres in romania hungary and the czech republic says bucsa so we can hope that those will create spill overs for those who are convinced by the cee proposition there is a universe of 3 000 listed companies to choose from with a combined market capitalisation of 1 trillion in ganev s view they offer a unique combination of high growth and excellent dividend yield furthermore penetration is low and the universe is growing poland has the largest stock market capitalisation to gdp ratio in the region at 55 but this is well below normal developed market levels of over 100 as financial literacy improves more cee companies are coming to understand the benefits of raising capital on the stock market just as households begin to see stock market investment perhaps through funds as an alternative to bank deposits local and international investors wishing to navigate this changing universe may find a way in through specialist regional managers such as karoll capital management trigon asset management in estonia raiffeisen in austria or stockholm based east capital they will of course argue that cee markets are inefficient and therefore a gift to active managers and that local knowledge is essential for success but there is something else too these markets are difficult to access by other means there are a couple of etfs covering russia but if you want exposure to the region you can t do it really easily says nedelcheva karoll capital management is taking its cee proposition to the uk germany north america and asia and about half of its investors are international in some ways traction is easier to achieve in asia where says ganev they ve been down this road investors considering these markets but perhaps lured away by the prospect of even higher growth elsewhere may also want to consider the diversification benefits they or at least some of them can provide in a gem context in the current environment in which emerging markets are highly sensitive to the possible scenarios regarding the us chinese trade conflict the cee markets are relatively immune says bakkum so if one were to think that the us and china will not strike a deal cee would possibly be a good place to hide 2019 funds europe

asymmetric trade deal sinks fed rally the federal reserve continued to release more doves overnight with the fomc erasing more dots from its plot and removing any hikes in 2019 moving to just one in 2020 chairman powell cited a weakening global economy us china trade and nervousness about the domestic economy for sitting on their hands somewhat confusingly he then said that the us economy remains strong with wage growth and inflation where they should be what is clear is that the federal reserve is now in a wait and see mode and will play what ends up in front of it bond yields fell across the us curve with the two year 10 year spread now almost flat bond markets have been telling the world for some time that they are much more circumspect about the global economic outlook than the irrational exuberance the equity markets continue to show a us yield curve approaching a negative inversion should speak volumes about how long term money sees the world in 2019 the falling yields holed the us dollar below the waterline as short term money piled into emerging market currencies and gold even as the fed and bond markets were yelling nervous patience the hot money in equities took a circumspect fed as a reason to buy with us stocks rallying why the street continues to buy stocks when central banks globally are screaming recession escapes these wizened old eyes my fall back position in these circumstances is the old saying markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent president trump was having none of that though nipping the post fed rally in the bud by saying the us wants an asymmetric trade deal the us wants to keep tariffs in place with china after a signed agreement to ensure they comply with the terms many would say this is a fair point but for china it clearly is not and likely explains the drawn out nature of the negotiations us equities quickly gave back all their gains with the manufacturing and bank heavy dow jones index falling 0 55 and the s p falling 0 29 with only the tech heavy nasdaq remaining in the green by a paltry 0 07 brexit also got murkier overnight if that was even possible as the eu told the uk that a short extension is not possible unless the british parliament passes a deal any sort of deal will do the eu has clearly lost patience with britain and with theresa may unable to control the uk speaker her cabinet her party or parliament the eu appear to be taking matters into their own hands addressing parliament directly with a stark choice sign off on the deal tout suite or risk being kicked out on 29 march or take a multi year extension hopefully with a new referendum and or government the harsh lesson in the one sided nature of votes when engaged in bilateral negotiations will probably not go unnoticed as the pound gbp fell 0 47 to 1 3200 even as the dollar fell across the board asia will be in for an interesting session as it needs to decide whether to follow a dovish federal reserve or sweat over potential trade deal delays today s data calendar highlights are australian unemployment at 0830 singapore time and the bank of indonesia rate decision at 1530 the former is a volatile number but with elections looming in the lucky country a poor print could see traders take flight and talk of reserve bank of australia rba rate cuts increase again taking the smart option indonesia is expected to hold steady waiting to see how things play out amongst the big boys first fx the us dollar was pummelled after the fomc with the dollar index falling 0 53 only the gbp slid against the greenback amongst the majors emerging markets currencies performed well with the brazilian real rising 0 8 and the mexican peso rising 1 versus the dollar this likely means asia will ignore the jittery bond market and trade talks with regional currencies possibly posting decent gains this morning the australian dollar aud will as always be a bit of a turkey shoot over employment data but may struggle to hold onto a 0 71 handle if the print is bad gbp has carved out some small gains in early session trading regaining 1 3200 the rally is modest though and it s possible the currency markets have yet to reprice the now much higher chance of a hard brexit preferring to focus on the likelihood of a long extension instead and assuming this will be bullish equities the author is torn this morning on regional equities will they follow the initial fed induced rally overnight or concentrate on the ominous trade talk remarks by president trump one suspects a combination of both with a possible small rally on regional bourses as bond rates fall tempered by trade talk tensions gold gold loves uncertainty and we saw plenty of that overnight falling bond yields and trade talk wobbles are the nectar of the gods to the yellow metal which staged a sparkling rally in new york rising usd12 from its 1 300 00 an ounce lows to 1 312 00 asia has seized the mantle in early trade rising

by nicholas larsen international banker when it comes to reporting on global financial markets it s the developed and emerging markets that tend to garner most of the attention but there s also a third group known as frontier markets that is proving increasingly appealing to fund managers thanks to the high growth opportunities currently being presented by its constituents currently a standard definition of what constitutes a frontier market remains open to interpretation the ftse financial times stock exchange for example uses its own assessment to categorise markets into either developed emerging or frontier according to how they score on its quality of markets assessment matrix for a country to be classified as a frontier market the matrix requires they have a formal stock market regulatory authority no significant restrictions on repatriation of capital a rare occurrence of failed trades t 5 or better clearing and settlement a timely trade reporting process in more general terms it is widely accepted that frontier markets are perceived to be capital markets that are normally found in the developing world but are less advanced than those classed as emerging markets this lack of development tends to mean that frontier markets are often characterised as being less liquid and more volatile than developed and emerging markets sometimes they are referred to by the investment community as emerging emerging markets and these constraints often prove pivotal in investors decisions of whether or not to gain exposure to frontier markets although they can potentially achieve lucrative returns from investing in such markets they must also be prepared to accept the higher risk profiles that accompany them the performance of the msci frontier markets index aptly illustrates the pronounced volatility experienced by frontier markets arguably the most renowned benchmark for capturing frontier market exposure the index lost 16 2 percent of its value in 2018 but in 2017 it gained a hefty 32 3 percent with bloomberg analysis in february 2018 showing that frontier markets outperformed developed and emerging markets in terms of volatility adjusted returns the index comprises both large and mid cap representation from 29 countries totalling 114 constituents and covering around 85 percent of the free float adjusted market capitalization in each country the 29 countries recognised by the msci are argentina bahrain bangladesh burkina faso benin croatia estonia guinea bissau ivory coast jordan kenya kuwait lebanon lithuania kazakhstan mauritius mali morocco niger nigeria oman romania serbia senegal slovenia sri lanka togo tunisia and vietnam many of these countries represent a segment of global stock markets that remain largely ignored by investors one reason they may be put off is due to the relative illiquidity of such markets especially when compared to emerging and developed markets as sam vecht co manager of the blackrock frontiers investment trust recently acknowledged understanding the economic and business cycles of the underlying countries is a crucial part of the stock selection process and is especially important given the low levels of liquidity in frontier markets which can fall further when the economy worsens that said however the illiquidity and resultant pricing inefficiencies means that profitable opportunities often surface for frontier market investors speaking recently to investors chronicle ross teverson manager of jupiter emerging frontier income trust jefi acknowledged that while emerging market valuations are currently looking attractive both relative to developed markets and their own history the companies we hold in frontier markets are trading on even more compelling valuations the relative opacity in such markets gives rise to significant disparities between the value of a frontier market company and its share price ultimately therefore frontier markets offer a treasure trove of hidden gems for the savvy investor frontier markets tend to experience higher economic growth rates on average than their emerging and developed counterparts moreover which is partly indicative of the spare capacity such economies have at their disposal to accommodate significant development this untapped potential in itself can encourage investors to get involved in frontier markets which according to perth tolle founder of life liberty indexes and emerging markets expert are like deep value investing as they re coming from an often abysmally low base they have the greatest potential for growth vietnam for example is being touted by the world bank to be among asia s fastest growing economies in 2019 with a 6 6 percent gdp gross domestic product growth rate forecast and as kevin snowball who co founded vietnam focused investment firm pxp vietnam asset management recently acknowledged vietnam s economy is similar to china s of 15 to 20 years ago it s opened up to foreign capital with the two main drivers being fdi and exports as the population becomes less poor domestic demand becomes a big feature that s the story in china and it will be a similar one here indeed the outlook for vietnam is so positive that the country is in danger of being promoted to emerging market status although it failed to be added to the msci watchlist for such a promotion last june recent reports suggest it is progressing ever closer to meeting the msci s requirements for the upgrade elsewhere within the frontier market realm investment managers are now eyeing several opportunities speaking recently to citywire the lead portfolio manager at netherlands asset management company nn investment partners marco ruijer recently identified four core frontier markets that he expects will outperform over the long term firstly zambia s public finances are expected to improve and the country may avoid default as an agreement with the international monetary fund imf for securing financial aid before the end of the year seems increasingly likely ivory coast is also singled out for its attractively valued euro denominated bonds the third country is pakistan which according to ruijer has significant support from gcc countries and could still establish an imf program and finally argentina is expected to also have strong backing from the imf meaning that it could recover in 2019 as long as the outcome of the presidential election is positive such promise means that from an investor s perspective the appetite for frontier markets is now starting to become greater albeit still slightly lagging that of developed and emerging markets according to the 2018 a t kearney foreign direct investment fdi confidence index 39 percent of investors surveyed wanted to increase their investments in frontier markets as compared to 40 percent in developed markets and 44 percent in emerging markets and investing in frontier markets has also become easier and more accessible in recent years especially through the creation of more exchange traded funds etfs with exposure to such markets indeed there are now no less than eight actively traded frontier market etfs in the united states that collectively total more than 1 billion of assets under management and because frontier markets tend to be weakly correlated to developed markets and even emerging markets they are now being viewed more favourably as effective ways for investment portfolios to achieve diversification over almost a six year period the ishares msci frontier 100 etf fm for instance was found to have only a 0 54 correlation to common us stocks and emerging market etfs it is clear that frontier markets offer a multitude of benefits to investors looking for both high growth opportunities and the possibility of diversifying their portfolios nevertheless a number of risks persistently arise in such markets including political unrest which is preventing countries such as myanmar from even being included in the frontier market category inadequate market infrastructure transparency and or liquidity volatility often due to currency fluctuations and an insufficiently diversified economy that relies on just one or two sectors such as oil and other commodities lax financial market regulation and poor standards of financial reporting ultimately therefore such factors may end up preventing promising frontier market stocks from performing as well as they would if they were to be found in a developed or emerging market it is the existence of such risks that means that frontier markets may only ever end up representing a small portion of an investment portfolio

appreciate each of you taking the time to join our call today we ll start this morning with an overview of our fourth quarter results and andrew will then cover our financials i ll provide an update on more recent market conditions and company focus and then andrew will conclude with our outlook we ll begin with a review of 2018 which was a significant year for covia including several key accomplishments first on a pro forma basis we sold 35 2 million tons and generated more than 2 3 billion in sales we expanded our canoitas facility in northern mexico to meet the growing needs of our mexican glass customers we also commissioned three plants to provide 8 million tons of nameplate local in basin production capacity to serve the energy markets in support of these local plants we ve achieved our targeted levels of contracting more than 70 of that capacity with key strategic customers who are industry leaders and our most significant accomplishment was bringing together two industry leading companies to form covia all of which was made possible by the hard work of our dedicated team members and the committed support of our board of directors i m proud to say that we ve made tremendous progress in integrating our business covia team members have concurrently achieved several important accomplishments that lay the foundation for current and future value creation some of these accomplishments include the complete integration of our sales operations and supply chain teams and their associated technology systems and through today we ve integrated approximately 90 of our business by revenue into our consolidated erp platform while there were many benefits from the combination one of the primary drivers was to create a unique flexible and low cost business model with balance and diversity both between our two segments and within each of our segments themselves as proppant supply began to rapidly outpace demand in mid 2018 we underscored this flexibility when we quickly idled nearly 7 million tons of capacity within our energy segment and consolidated production into our most efficient and competitive assets as overall market prices and volumes declined we leveraged that network of assets to strengthen our competitive position and to grow market share for 2018 our diverse and sizable industrial segment posted solid overall revenues and generated very attractive cash flow throughout the year however despite this top line growth gross margins for our industrial business were below our expectations due to a few key factors first our mexican business posted solid growth in overall revenues but was adversely impacted by above average general cost inflation and in particular in utilities a devaluation of the peso and high interim costs prior to the full commercial expansion of our canoitas facility in the u s we saw higher operating costs at many of our hybrid plants that serve both our industrial and our energy customers particularly in the third and fourth quarter as energy volumes fell quickly additionally certain industrial sites had higher than normal stripping and contractor costs throughout the year our operations teams have made several adjustments to better align our capacity to overall market demand and to recalibrate those production sites that were impacted by higher costs in 2018 thus improving our cost position as we will move through 2019 turning to our energy segment we estimate overall market volumes to have declined nearly 20 sequentially in the fourth quarter exiting at an annualized run rate in the high 60 million ton range despite this sharp market decline our volumes were down modestly with 4 4 million energy tons sold during the quarter representing what we believe to be a meaningful increase in market share for covia several factors both positively and negatively impacted these results first our kermit and seiling facilities had slower than expected ramp up which impacted both our volume growth and our overall cost during the quarter at kermit operational challenges associated with ramping the plant limited our production and our fixed cost leverage including an elevated cost of powering the plant with generators before connecting to the utility grid in november at seiling freezing weather delayed the plant completion and the scaling of production resulting in lower sales volumes and higher costs these issues have also persisted throughout most of the first quarter however we ve achieved significant improvement in march and we expect to reach our full production capacity by the end of the second quarter for all three of our local sand plants and importantly we expect our costs to come in line with our long term expectations concurrent with this volume ramp notwithstanding these challenges our local sand facilities did continue to ramp up throughout the fourth quarter and sold over 700 000 tons during the quarter which is an increase of over 500 000 tons compared to the third quarter these volumes help to offset decreased volumes from our voca plants which we began to idle during the fourth quarter as well as lower volumes from our northern white facilities in addition to the incremental local capacity our northern white plants performed well in the fourth quarter relative to the overall market and contributed to our solid results we continue to sell northern white sand into every major basin including those that have excess to local sand and with our low cost facilities balanced rail exposure unit train capabilities and expansive logistics network we re well positioned to serve our customer base at a competitive overall price gain share and generate sustainable margins on our northern white sand finally our cross functional teams did an excellent job of understanding our customer needs and leveraging covia s strengths in order to deliver the proper solutions to address those needs we credit them for a solid fourth quarter performance particularly in light of the more challenging market conditions within the energy segment i m happy to now turn the call over to andrew to cover the financial results andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jenniffer good morning everyone for the total company fourth quarter revenue totaled 441 3 million compared to 523 4 million in the third quarter this sequential decline was due primarily to lower proppant pricing while the typical seasonal slowdown in our industrial business also had a more modest impact quarter gross profit totaled 81 8 million in the fourth quarter which was a decrease from the third quarter of 117 8 million the fourth quarter figure includes 8 1 million in losses related to the ramping of production at our seiling and kermit facilities and 3 6 million in non cash purchase accounting adjustments the rest of the sequential decline was driven primarily by lower proppant pricing and fixed cost leverage at our northern white facilities moving to segment performance and beginning first with industrial fourth quarter 2018 revenues were 185 7 million an increase of 3 7 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 aided primarily by higher average selling prices compared to 2017 industrial gross profit was 50 5 million and includes 1 1 million in non cash inventory charges related to purchase accounting this compares to 53 9 million in gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to the purchase accounting charges and as jenniffer also mentioned costs at our hybrid facilities also increased due to lower energy volumes which led to lower fixed cost utilization in our energy segment revenues totaled 255 6 million in the fourth quarter a decrease of 69 million sequentially this decrease was due to a mix shift toward sales at the mine which carry a lower average selling price as well as reduced northern white pricing we believe market pricing for northern white reached a bottom in early 2019 energy gross profit was 31 3 million during the quarter or approximately 7 20 per ton these figures include 2 5 million in purchase accounting charges or nearly 0 60 per ton the decline in profitability was driven primarily by lower northern white pricing primarily resulting from having the full quarter impact of pricing concessions which were made in the third quarter which was offset somewhat by the idling of higher cost facilities additionally our results were negatively impacted by the 8 1 million in negative margins at our seiling and kermit facilities as they started and scaled production during the quarter sg a for the quarter was 45 8 million which included 2 4 million of non cash stock compensation and 1 9 million of integration expenses adjusted ebitda totaled 43 9 million for the fourth quarter this figure includes 8 1 million in negative margins at kermit and seiling as i previously mentioned as well as 3 6 million in purchase accounting charges these items were partially offset by the positive impact of the 5 million valuation adjustment of the contingent liability in the fourth quarter we had a tax expense of 4 5 million at the end of december we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately 300 million that can be utilized to offset future taxable income in the u s which will result in minimal cash taxes paid in future periods additionally we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately 18 million in 2019 due to revised tax liabilities from prior years this refund will be largely offset by expected international tax payments during the year operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was 57 1 million turning to the balance sheet capital expenditures was 75 6 million in the fourth quarter primarily for the completion of our local sand facilities the capex figure was above our previous guidance of 50 55 million due to the acceleration of planned 2019 spending into 2018 as well as unforeseen spending associated with the ramping of our in basin plants these items have resulted in our 2019 forecast for capex to range between 80 100 million versus the previously provided 90 110 million we ended the quarter with 322 million in liquidity including 134 million of cash and 188 million in availability on our revolver as you may have noticed from the 8 k we filed this morning we recently amended the terms of our revolving credit agreement to raise the net debt to adjusted ebitda covenants to 6 6x in 2019 5 5x in 2020 versus the 4x under the original agreement importantly we have maintained the full 200 million facility with no change to the interest rate spread providing us with substantial liquidity and flexibility if needed our term loan had a balance of 1 63 billion at the end of the year and as a reminder the term loan matures in 2025 and does not have any covenants now i ll turn the call over to jenniffer who will provide an update on our markets and on key strategic initiatives jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president thanks andrew i ll begin with our industrial segment where 2019 volumes have been relatively flat to prior year thus far stronger overall volumes in our combined glass markets have been offset by a bit softer volumes on a few other end markets including our ceramics and sports and recreation markets to start the year one particular market in which we see continued strength is containerized glass in our mexico markets in addition to completed 2018 expansion project at our canoitas facility which i mentioned earlier we ve also recently commenced an additional expansion project to meet further customer demand for our products in this region canoitas is a prime example of how our long history of commitment and partnership with our industrial customers both within and across cyclical periods are of great mutual benefit for both parties over the long term moving to our energy segment the demand softness that we saw at the end of 2018 continued through january and february as operators were slow to get back to work from lower commodity prices at the end of 2018 additionally exceptionally cold temperatures throughout much of the u s hampered completion activities for customers in several basins this weather also impacted operations at our plants in the north while we were successful in moving volumes our costs were negatively impacted by these events as well as by annual freight rate increases throughout march we ve seen volumes pick up noticeably and are expecting double digit sequential volume growth in the second quarter for our energy segment overall we believe market demand for proppant in the first quarter will be at an average run rate in the low 70 million ton range only modestly above the high 60s we saw in the fourth quarter however we believe the market is exiting the first quarter at an annualized run rate in the low 80 million ton per year range and as weather conditions improve we expect proppant demand in the second quarter will continue to accelerate into the mid 90 million annualized ton range turning to supply we believe the unsustainably low market pricing in the fourth quarter resulted in additional higher cost supply exiting the market either through the idling of plants or derating of capacity we estimate between 20 25 million tons of supply have come offline since june of last year and this figure is likely conservative as additional facilities have likely derated capacity which is more difficult to precisely track also we believe that some higher cost supply has remained in the market as winter stockpiles are drawn down and which may move to additional supply reductions as these stockpiles are exhausted and investments must be reconsidered with this contraction of supply and with demand improving we ve seen early signs of market stabilization for northern white toward the end of the first quarter we instituted a modest price increase on northern white sand while relatively small the price increase is a positive step and furthers our belief that we ve seen a bottom in northern white sand pricing and that customers also value the complete solutions that we can provide as we enter the second quarter we expected additional price increases these operational advances for covia combined with strong market dynamics and a strengthening price environment should provide positive overall tailwinds into the second quarter for local sand there continues to be additional supply entering the market although the pace of these additions has begun to slow and the ultimate effective utilization of nameplate capacities remains yet to be seen we believe the oversupply of local sand in the permian will likely persist throughout 2019 in order to navigate this environment we ve contracted more than 70 of our nameplate capacity under long term agreements with customers who value covia s complete product portfolio and ability to consistently deliver solutions as we discussed in our last call we believe that the long term demand mix between northern white and local sands has yet to settle out third party lab results have indicated that the shape and polycrystalline structure inherent in local sand results in a lower crush strength and greater fines generation compared to northern white these factors may lead to conductivity issues in certain well environments particularly in areas with higher closure stress such as in the delaware basin while many customers have converted to regional sand there are also customers who continue to see the value in pumping northern white sand either in total or in wells where local sands are less fit for purpose for these customers they expect that the use of northern white sand particularly for higher pressure wells will result in a higher return for wells and we have continued to sign new contracts for northern white sand during the first quarter as such we continue to believe that demand in basins with local sand availability will continue to be served by a mix of both local sand and northern white sand further enhancing our customer value proposition is our ability to now offer last mile solutions where needed we placed our first last mile system this quarter and through an asset light model we will continue to offer leading options to those customers who prefer that the last mile solution be provided by the sand supplier lastly our balanced product solution consisting of local sand in two basins low cost northern white supply value added products low cost unit train capabilities on five different class 1 railroads and mine to well capability strongly position us to meet the needs of our customers wherever and whatever they may be and as i previously mentioned we re exiting the first quarter in a stronger position from where we began the year regarding the ramp of our local sand capacities which will set the foundation for both higher volumes and improved costs as we enter the second quarter as we think about our overall priorities for 2019 our focus is on execution of our base business including the leveraging of our recent investments in both industrial and energy capacities and on overall cash generation and net debt reduction we further anticipate that the completion of our erp platform consolidation will drive added cost savings through advancing our remaining organizational integration enabling greater spend analysis and margin optimization and improving our working capital management we also expect to significantly reduce our 2019 capital spending these measures underscore our commitment to reducing net debt in 2019 and coupled with our well positioned energy assets and our large and predictable industrial business we re confident that we have a pathway to accomplish this goal with that i d like to turn the call back over to andrew to provide our more specific outlook andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jenniffer starting with industrial we anticipate the first quarter 2019 volumes will be approximately 3 5 million tons relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2018 the second quarter we expect industrial volumes to be 3 8 million tons or relatively similar to the prior year period at the beginning of 2019 we instituted a low single digit percentage price increase on average across our portfolio in line with prior years for energy we expect volumes in the first quarter to be approximately 4 4 million tons or similar to the fourth quarter march volumes are expected to be significantly stronger than january or february we anticipate margins in the first quarter to be down approximately 3 00 3 50 per ton driven by slight declines in pricing and higher overall costs these cost increases will be partially offset by improving operating performance of our local facilities which are rapidly increasing production as we look forward into the second quarter we expect energy volumes to range between 5 5 3 million tons which represents double digit percentage sequential growth in both northern white and local sand we also anticipate the improving volumes will allow us to further increase prices for our northern white sand particularly for those locations where we saw freight rate increases at the beginning of the year we also expect the higher monthly northern white volumes better weather conditions and the ramp up of our new local facilities to largely reverse the cost headwinds we experienced in the first quarter for the full year we anticipate sg a will total 160 170 million which includes approximately 10 million in non cash stock compensation this represents a reduction of 18 28 million from the 2018 sg a levels excluding integration costs finally and as i mentioned earlier capital expenditures are expected to be 80 100 million for the full year 2019 a reduction from our previous guidance as some of this spending occurred in 2018 back to you jenniffer jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president thanks andrew i ll conclude our prepared remarks today by saying that our industrial markets remain strong and while the energy market remains dynamic we re encouraged that recent trends and momentum bode well for the coming quarters and the outlook for covia our diversified business model combined with our firm commitment to maximizing cash generation and deleveraging our balance sheet will continue to position covia for success before we take questions i d like to again thank our covia team members many of whom are continuing to do double duty of integrating the company while also ensuring that we re meeting and exceeding our customers needs in order to remain a leader in our industry with that leandra could you please open the line for questions questions and answers operator at this time if you would like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad we ll pause for just a moment to compile the q a roster and our first question comes from the line of kurt hallead with rbc your line is open kurt hallead rbc capital markets managing director hey good morning thank you for that detailed update you gave great color regarding the progression as you head out into the first half of the year i was really curious about the dynamics around your commentary on northern white pricing what do you think the primary drivers of that pricing dynamic are is it just simply the fact that you ve had idle capacity or is it the fact that you ve seen also growing demand i guess i m just trying to gauge whether it s more supply or whether it s a combination of increasing demand along with a lower supply jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president for the first quarter well i think it s a combination of both kurt and i think most recently it s the increase in demand because we saw that capacity come out across the last six months and i think it s also outlook and i would also say an important factor is the position of our assets because whether that s through the actual price that we pass on to the customer or the leverage and cost reduction that they get on their end from using our assets i think that it s those three things we do believe that the total market is going to be up as i mentioned in both the first and second quarter kurt hallead rbc capital markets managing director great thank you i appreciate that and then maybe a quick follow up for andrew you mentioned contribution margins per ton being down 3 00 3 50 sequentially in the first quarter i just want to be sure were you referencing energy specific on that andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s correct energy specifically kurt hallead rbc capital markets managing director okay great that s it for me thank you guys andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of harry pollans with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions just to clarify on the energy contribution margin per ton guidance is that off the clean contribution margin per ton for 4q excluding the start up costs and the non cash inventory charges andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so what i would say there harry is i would that s off of the purchase accounting adjusted figures so what we would expect over the course of q1 is we saw some higher costs in our northern white facilities because of the weather related challenges that jenniffer mentioned particularly in january and february we also experience freight rate increases down our railed lanes and then that will be offset in part by our expansion of volumes in west texas which are improving our unit costs there as well as in oklahoma with our seiling facility but all in all the gross margin per ton is across all of the tons and it s on the clean number after the purchase accounting adjustment harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay so we should be adding back the start up costs in 4q to go off that andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer no you shouldn t you should not be adding that back harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it and then just one more on the northern white pricing increases is that mesh specific could you clarify the magnitude of those price increases or is that across all of your mesh size jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president the price increase is across generally all of the product categories clearly it was a modest price increase as we mentioned and we certainly can t quantify yet the first quarter because we re actively in those discussions what i would say is that we understand the complexity of the many moving parts here which is why we ve tried to quantify it from a margin perspective for you because we recognize there s many moving parts here and that includes so the margin includes both our price and cost expectations harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful and then if i could sneak in one more how much start up cost do you expect in 1q do you expect it to be up or down andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer no we would expect that to come down quite a bit that s been built into the guidance that we ve provided so we do expect that to come down as our volumes ramp up quickly at least in the first quarter harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks so much guys i ll hop back in the queue andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks harry jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president thanks harry operator as a reminder if you would like to ask a question you can press 1 on your telephone keypad and your next question comes from the line of mike urban with seaport global your line is open michael urban seaport global managing director thanks good morning andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning mike jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president good morning michael urban seaport global managing director i wonder if you could talk just a little bit about your contracting strategy in the past you guys have shied away from especially take or pay contracts just given the tendency for them to go away whenever it s not beneficial for the customers it sounds like you are contracting more volumes are those take or pay or are those essentially volume agreements with some price variability if you could just give us a little bit a sense of what those contain and your thoughts here going forward on the contracts jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president we actually maintain a similar position in that the majority of our contracts are a function of market price we do have a degree call it 20 25 probably in fixed cost and or indexed but we continue to believe that those contracts even while fixed or indexed you need to help your customers to be competitive and so we believe that market based contracts provide the most flexibility and align ourselves with the customers the best michael urban seaport global managing director got it and then on the last mile you said you deployed your first last mile solution how many more do you expect to deploy here over the course of the quarter or the year jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president that s a great question it s certainly a moving target our strategy is to provide those solutions where the customer really is desiring that to be provided integrated with the sand business we believe that s a small percentage of the market and so we don t expect this to become a big growth driver although it will generate some margins for us our strategy is to make sure that we ve maximized our addressable market for sand michael urban seaport global managing director okay i think you just addressed it there but so you are capturing some margin there given that you have the asset light model presumably you re going to have to pay a third party for some of these assets and they ll capture some margin so you do think you re capturing some of that margin there and it s not necessarily just a volume driver so in other words they prefer to have sand from covia and as long as you provide the last mile you ll do that but you re able to capture some margin on top of that andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer our primary goal with the asset light last mile solution is to offer multiple solutions to the customer base to provide them with the flexibility we re not doing it as a major margin contributor to our business now having said that we will earn some margin but we don t anticipate it being a huge growth driver for our business in 2019 michael urban seaport global managing director okay that s all for me thank you jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris voie with wells fargo your line is open christopher voie wells fargo analyst good morning jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president good morning chris christopher voie wells fargo analyst just curious within the guidance getting to 5 5 3 million tons in 2q can you give a sense of what s baked into that in terms of in basin versus northern white does that assume that all the growth comes from in basin or potentially even a further decline for northern white volumes in there just given the industry shift or maybe a little more color on that andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so i would say that we re expecting in q2 double digit percentage increases in both northern white and local sand so you will see from a percentage basis you re going to see a higher percentage of local sand growth that s because we re ramping up the facilities but we are expecting a meaningful uptick in northern white sand as well and so that s really driven by the overall growth we re seeing in the market christopher voie wells fargo analyst okay that s helpful and then within the in basin market can you give a sense of what kind of specific pricing trends you re seeing not just for yourself but a sense of where the spot market is for in basin in terms of on the pricing level how that has declined quarter over quarter and maybe if you see any kind of premium for your contracts versus where the market is currently andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer sure it s a good question so i d make a few comments here one is that we re more than 70 contracted in our local sand markets that we re selling into i d also say that over the last six months or so we ve seen pricing for our customer base declining roughly 10 00 12 00 including q1 and that s also been factored into our guidance as well unlike northern white sand we don t anticipate pricing opportunities in these markets given the supply situation and the meaningful capacity that keeps coming on but offsetting that to some extent are going to be some of these start up challenges that have been rampant across the industry so it s a bit hard to gauge the overall effective capacity that s going to be selling into these local markets but i would say that we really don t anticipate pricing improvement in 19 unlike northern white where we think that market is a bit more stabilized christopher voie wells fargo analyst got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of harry pollans with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys just one more talk a bit about permian pricing in basin and the delta between the spot and the contracted pricing trends right now jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president sure harry good morning as andrew mentioned and as i mentioned in our comments all of our the predominance of our products are going to our contracted customers and so we really are not participating in the spot market and so it s probably difficult for us to comment other than that we ve seen the 10 00 12 00 decline over the last six month period andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer and i think that spot market pricing is very misleading because a lot of spot market pricing is driven by the fire selling of production if your silo is getting nearly full and you need to offload inventory you ll see spot pricing drop can drop significantly relative to what you might sell larger more consistent volumes at so i think it s a bit misleading to look to that as an indicator of where overall pricing is going to go harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it makes sense and then for seiling you guys said you had 70 contracted across all your in basin lines is that on average or are you guys having trouble locking up any capacity at seiling as in basin mines start ramping up there jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president that is on average but all of our plants including seiling are at or above our targeted 70 harry pollans bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that s all i ve got thanks guys andrew eich executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president thanks harry operator we have no further questions at this time i ll turn the call back to jenniffer deckard for closing remarks jenniffer deckard chief executive officer and vice president okay thanks leandra and thanks to all of you for listening and participating today and we look forward to meeting with many of you over the next coming weeks so have a great day everyone and thanks very much operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect duration 38 minutes call participants matthew schlarb director investor

amlo risks a fall as he tries to pull pemex back from the brink mexico city bloomberg pemex is personal for andres manuel lopez obrador who grew up in mexico s oil heartland at a time when the state company was a source of national pride now that he s president the leftist leader has made it a priority to pull pemex out of a two decade slump investors are worried that the opposite could happen with the company dragging lopez obrador down instead and the economy with him petroleos mexicanos the company s full name is already the world s most indebted oil major owing about 108 billion amlo needs to cut that debt while boosting investment and output his solution slashing taxes on the company that has been a cash cow for the state for decades the market concern is that he will fail to restore pemex to profitability it s been in the red since 2012 while opening a black hole in the government budget serious trouble at pemex can be truly toxic for sentiment and the broader economy and would contaminate the sovereign balance sheet said alberto ramos the chief latin america economist at goldman sachs group in new york lopez obrador s predecessor tried to turn it around by opening the door to private and foreign investment the plan failed to halt a 14 year decline in output which reached a record low of 1 62 mmbpd in january lopez obrador has since halted the project truly toxic pemex could threaten mexico s hard won reputation for sound finances and pass on higher borrowing costs to its global businesses like cement maker cemex or billionaire carlos slim s phone carrier america movil the central bank for one is worried pemex was barely mentioned at interest rate meetings last year but that changed after the company s credit score at fitch ratings was lowered by two notches in january taking it to the brink of junk status at the latest meeting in february a majority of policy makers warned of the wider risks posed by pemex s financial fragility they said another downgrade could hurt the federal government s ability to borrow mexico is already expected to lose its investment grade sovereign rating in upcoming years according to almost 70 of respondents in a bank of america survey built in a day there s a common perception among investors that the oil company s bonds are backstopped by the federal government its sole owner in the absence of default the premise has never been tested even as pemex piled up debt it routinely ranks among the biggest emerging market bond issuers and has 5 3 billion of payments due by the end of may the company says it expects output to pick up in 2020 after another decline this year it s working to control spending and trim leverage chief financial officer alberto velazquez told investors last month rome wasn t built in a day he said jaime reusche at moody s investors service says lopez obrador is taking a fiscal risk by committing to prop up the company at the same time as embarking on ambitious social and infrastructure plans he won election by a landslide last year by vowing to end decades of below par economic growth that left half the population stuck in poverty he s promised higher pensions and student allowances and new railways all without significant tax hikes viable plan pemex is getting its share last month lopez obrador announced a package including an extra 24 billion pesos 1 3 billion in tax breaks over six years the peso weakened in response on concern that the measures might be a step in the right direction but fell short of a viable business plan lopez obrador favors boosting investment in onshore and shallow water production which has quicker but smaller returns than the deep water and non conventional exploration favored by his predecessor he has also embarked on a crusade against fuel theft which costs pemex some 3 5 billion a year and other forms of corruption he plans to build a new refinery that almost all analysts see as an expensive white elephant the direct economic impact of whatever transpires at pemex may be limited oil and gas contributed just 3 4 of gdp last year less than half the level of 25 years ago a reflection of the company s decline as well as the growth of other industries like autos still it s the country s second largest employer after wal mart with almost 130 000 employees and it s a big contributor to the budget over the past two decades 95 of pemex s profits went to the government a bigger share even than venezuela s state oil company according to capital economics last year it contributed one fifth of the tax take there s a case for easing that burden as amlo is doing according to shamaila khan director of emerging market debt at alliancebernstein in new york but the move could backfire mexico has to give some support to pemex and take less money said khan the problem is that adds up to more fiscal pressure on the country
banks led u s stocks mostly lower wednesday after a brief rally sparked by the federal reserve s latest policy update faded the real action centred in the bond market where prices rose sharply pulling treasury yields down to the lowest levels they ve seen in more than a year the central bank said it has ruled out interest rate increases this year and issued a dimmer outlook on the u s economy that triggered one of the biggest slides for treasury yields in months knocking the 10 year treasury yield as low as 2 53 per cent down from 2 61 per cent late tuesday and from 3 20 per cent late last year

bank projected two rate hikes in 2019 the move comes as fed officials project that the u s economy will grow more slowly this year and in 2020 a change from the panel s projections just three months ago the central bank also said it will stop shrinking its bond portfolio in september a step that would help hold down long term interest rates the fed s announcement was clearly positive for the market said quincy krosby chief market strategist at prudential financial powell s suggestion that the fed is on hold this year is important she said the question for the market remains whether or not

the decision to go on hold mr powell said economic data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another in my view is likely to put downward pressure on the us currency limiting the ability of other central banks to tighten policy for instance in the face of falling unemployment at the same time emerging markets such as india turkey and brazil can claim a small win from the fed pivot as the policy stall reduces incentives for investors to shift capital into us assets in turn that eases downward pressure on their economies and curbs imported goods inflation allowing their central banks to reverse some of the bruising rate hikes of recent years for the reserve bank of australia which is itself drifting away from a tightening bias even as unemployment falls the fed decision means martin place now has even less scope to increase borrowing costs without risking a stronger australian dollar the magnitude of the change was stunning omair sharif socgen mr powell is not alone in becoming more cautious the european central bank sprung its own surprise earlier this month when it curbed its forecasts and revived a crisis era lending program for banks advertisement olli rhen who heads finland s central bank and is seen as a strong contender to succeed ecb president mario draghi said last week that the central bank should review its policy options and practices because of a worrisome failure to hit the inflation target meanwhile the bank of england will on thursday keep its key rate on hold at 0 75 per cent not least because of uncertainty about britain s departure from the european union china too has been easing policy in the face of domestic weakness and the broader global slowdown welcome to the club said omair sharif a societe generale economist of the fed s shift the magnitude of the change was stunning as nine individuals who had been looking for either one or two hikes in december dropped to zero hikes mr sharif said in just six months the fed has gone from a view towards needing to be in restrictive territory to being slightly accommodative after two days of meetings fed policy makers also lowered their forecast for us gross domestic product growth in 2019 to 2 1 per cent from 2 3 per cent and announced they would in september halt the process of running down the balance sheet built up through post crisis quantitative easing advertisement having closed down the fed s double barrelled tightening strategy of 2018 which culminated in december with the ninth hike in three years mr powell said he would remain patient about the likely path of policy futures markets have moved to price in a rate cut later this year the yield on the us 10 year treasury note plunged 9 basis points to 2 52 per cent in late new york trade while insisting the us economy is in a good place mr powell listed a litany of global risks including brexit weaker growth and concern about consumer spending compared with last year when he anticipated gross domestic product growth of 2 5 per cent in 2019 data arriving from september suggests growth is slowing somewhat more than expected he told reporters in washington the atlanta fed s gdpnow model puts the pace of growth in the current quarter at 0 4 per cent advertisement cementing a rapid shift in perspective in recent months the fed now also expects to raise borrowing costs only once more until 2021 and no longer anticipates the need to guard against inflation with restrictive monetary policy the price of the us 10 year note spiked after the fed policy statement and updated projections bloomberg the fed s outlook for rates economic projections and balance sheet policy are all more dovish than expectations said td securities economist michael hanson the fed detailed its long awaited pledge to slow the monthly reduction of its holdings of treasury bonds from up to us30 billion 42 billion to no more than us15 billion beginning in may it said it would end its balance sheet runoff in september provided the economy and money market conditions evolved as expected redemptions of mortgage backed securities would at that point be reinvested in treasuries up to as much as us20 billion per month moving the fed generally towards a treasuries only approach to its assets advertisement critics warned the fed s decision to effectively give up on its policy normalisation strategy could leave policy makers with less scope to stimulate the us economy if fears of a recession are realised we don t have much ammunition in the fed holster right now said former dallas fed president richard fisher he also criticised the fed s decision to signal no more rate hikes in 2019 something he would have cautioned against were he still sitting at the table that was a pretty radical statement and i m not sure that was a wise thing to do said mr fisher fed policymakers interest rate projections fomc updated quarterly economic projections released by the fed showed weakening on all fronts compared with forecasts from december with unemployment expected to be slightly higher this year inflation edging down and economic growth lower as well advertisement growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter the fed said recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter overall inflation has declined inflation for the year is now seen at 1 8 per cent compared with the fed s forecast in december of 1 9 per cent

globe newswire mechel pao moex mtlr nyse mtl a leading russian mining and steel group announces financial results for the fy 2018 mechel pao s chief executive officer oleg korzhov commented the group finished the year 2018 with a year on year 5 increase in revenue and 9 increase in profit attributable to equity shareholders of mechel pao ebitda went down by 7 year on year the revenue growth was due to positive price dynamics in steel and steelmaking commodity markets ebitda went down year on year because of a decline in the mining division s product sale volumes due to railcar shortages in the second half of 2018 and the corresponding shift in the division s focus to overcome the underrun of resource preparation for future mining this decision enabled us to decrease accumulated product stocks and increase stripping works which will have positive effect in the future the negative impact of the decline in shipment volumes was partly made up by the favorable market situation which enabled us to sell metallurgical coal at average prices exceeding levels of 2017 i would like to note another important event by early 2019 we successfully refinanced our one billion dollar syndicated loan which yielded extra finance income to the group also in 2018 our lenders wrote off 17 5 billion rubles in fines and penalties which reduced our debt and had a positive impact on our profit for this period which grew year on year even as we take into account the major negative effect from the ruble s depreciation consolidated results for the full year 2018 mln rubles fy 2018 fy 2017 4q 18 3q

billion rubles which is 7 less than in 2017 profit attributable to equity shareholders of mechel pao grew by 9 year on year due to increase in revenue as well as finance income from the write off of fines and penalties which resulted from our fulfilling the conditions of our debt s restructuring by russian state owned banks and which totaled 17 5 billion rubles as well as 13 billion rubles from restructuring the pre export syndicated loan our finance expenses went down by 5 6 billion rubles or 12 year on year due to decrease of the bank of russia key interest rate as well as the group s efforts to restructure debt and decrease debt costs in 2018 our operating cash flow went up by 4 8 billion rubles to reach 68 1 billion which is sufficient to ensure the group s key operational needs and fulfilling our loan obligations in full in mining segment revenue from sales to third parties in 2018 amounted to 96 9 billion rubles which is 3 less than in 2017 100 1 billion rubles this effect is due to the decrease in coal product sale volumes that was partially made up for by the growth of both global and domestic prices the division s operating profit s decline by 32 and ebitda s 26 decrease year on year was largely due to the slump in sales volume while production costs went up as we significantly increased stripping volumes necessary to restore and step up production the favorable global trend of growing prices for our steel segment s products continued its positive impact on the division s results this trend led to a 9 increase in revenue from third party sales in this reporting period in 2018 the segment profit attributable to equity shareholders of mechel pao amounted to 693 million rubles as compared to 2017 recorded loss of 4 5 billion rubles mining segment mechel mining management ooo s chief executive officer pavel shtark noted in the past year the division focused on overcome the underrun of resource preparation for mining in order to restore our production and sales volumes stripping works on all the group s coal mining assets went up by 25 year on year and more than by one and a half at korshunov mining plant we achieved this due to the technical upgrade program as well as bringing in contractors several of the division s assets corrected their plans and decreased mining in late 2018 and early 2019 due to massive accumulated undistributed stock as a consequence of limitations in railcars supply on one hand it led to a decline in mining but on the other enabled us to unload storages and optimize production and equipment repair costs which are traditionally high in winter due to extremely low temperatures this year the division s assets will continue to renew their mining fleet the contractors we have brought in to work at our assets also increase the number of machines involved in mining works considering the major work we have done last year to prepare reserves for mining we expect our output to grow this year the persistently high prices on the mining division s products will also help us improve our financial results mln rubles fy 2018 fy 2017 4q 18 3q 18 revenue from contracts with external customers 96

editor s note figure 3 of this report was updated on april 15 2019 to correct a mislabeling of the bars in the graphic representing philadelphia and those representing the median of the comparison cities overview cities exist within a competitive world and to prosper they must provide public services and amenities at a reasonable cost to taxpayers philadelphia is widely seen as having high taxes which some civic leaders and analysts view as detrimental to the city s economic prospects in this report the pew charitable trusts examines philadelphia s tax burden and assesses the spending and other elements that drive it to make these assessments the research looked at taxes and expenditures in 30 of the nation s most populous cities it found that philadelphia ranked in the top 10 in both taxes and spending per capita when taking into account every unit of local government that serves these locales in philadelphia s case these units included city government the school district and independent agencies such as the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa the research found that philadelphia s status as both a city and county played a significant role in its rankings among the 30 cities most of which are not also counties this is due in part to philadelphia s relatively high spending in several areas including courts health welfare and corrections that are typically handled throughout the nation at the county level in fact philadelphia s per capita spending on what are generally considered county functions was more than twice as high as the 30 city median most of the 30 cities with which philadelphia is compared are part of larger counties that perform these functions and receive revenue from suburban areas where the tax bases tend to be healthier in spending on services typically handled by cities such as policing fire protection and sanitation philadelphia was near the 30 city median although it was higher in several specific areas the analysis of the 30 cities based on fiscal year 2015 data the most recent at the time that this research was performed relies on the fiscally standardized cities fisc database created by the lincoln institute of land policy located in cambridge massachusetts the database which uses numbers collected by the u s census bureau s annual survey of state and local government finances includes all the funds raised and spent by all local governments serving each city including the municipal government school district and special purpose districts for such functions as transit and parks and where applicable the county that surrounds and includes the city some of the other key findings include in 2015 the local government bodies serving philadelphia collected 3 004 per capita in local taxes the fifth highest total among the 30 cities this figure includes taxes on income sales property and businesses on residents and nonresidents the city of philadelphia imposes a broader range of taxes than most other municipalities the local governments serving philadelphia received 6 303 per capita in revenue from all sources including state and federal aid as well as local taxes the seventh highest total the overall per capita expenditures for all local governments in philadelphia was 6 209 per capita the eighth highest total relative to the other cities philadelphia s spending on police and trash collection was high while its spending on highways and parks and recreation was low all of these are classified as municipal functions in this analysis overall expenditures for public education in philadelphia were 1 689 per capita 9 percent higher than the median in addition the research showed that two other key factors influence the revenue and expenditure patterns in philadelphia one is that the city faces a high demand for services due to relatively high crime and poverty rates the other is that the city s tax base is low well below the 30 city medians for property value personal income and retail sales this makes generating funds to pay for local services seem more onerous by necessitating steeper tax rates than would be required in a jurisdiction with higher incomes and real estate values these factors as well as philadelphia s status as both a city and county are the underlying institutional fiscal and demographic realities that are essential to understanding philadelphia s tax burden as well as the level of revenue and expenditures that produce it introduction this report examines revenue and expenditures as well as some other factors that explain why philadelphia s tax burden is relatively high among major u s cities it considers how the per capita spending of all the local governments serving philadelphia in total and for individual program categories compares with the median of 30 of the 31 most populous u s cities washington was excluded because of its unique governmental status performing the functions of a city a county and a state to illuminate the drivers of taxation in cities it also compares for each major category the amount of spending per capita that is supported by local tax dollars the comparisons consider the revenue and expenditures of all local governmental entities that serve city residents the information is drawn from the fisc database which aggregates for each city the financial activity of all those entities such a perspective is needed for comparative analysis because of the wide variation in how local governments are organized some cities are served by separate city and county governments while others such as philadelphia are both a city and a county public education may be provided by a school district city government or county cities also vary in the types of special districts that provide services to their community the fisc data aggregates spending and revenue by all these types of government allowing for meaningful comparisons most important the fisc concept replicates the experience of city residents who pay taxes to and receive services from multiple local government entities 1 in philadelphia the fisc data represent spending and revenue by the city government the school district of philadelphia and special districts such as septa the philadelphia housing authority and the delaware river port authority because the comparisons are based on revenue and expenditures in 2015 the most recent year available when the research began this is a one year snapshot and the results for any other year might look somewhat different glossary of terms throughout this report the following terms are used to describe governmental organizations and finances consolidated city county local governments that serve simultaneously as municipal and county governments among the 30 comparison cities nine are consolidated city counties including philadelphia the others are baltimore denver indianapolis jacksonville florida louisville kentucky nashville tennessee new york city and san francisco new york city consists of five counties county functions functions that are generally the responsibility of county government including courts corrections welfare and public health revenue provided by one level of government to another such as from the federal or state government to a city or county intergovernmental revenue revenue provided by one level of government to another such as from the federal or state government to a city or county fiscally standardized city fisc a unit of analysis created by the lincoln institute of land policy it includes revenue and expenditures of all local governments that provide services within a city s boundaries in addition to the city government these entities may include a county one or more school districts and multiple special districts in cases where these governments also serve areas beyond the city boundaries their revenue and expenditures are allocated to the fiscally standardized city based on the share of their population that resides within the city local government all units of government that provide services to city residents including cities counties school districts and special districts special districts can include any unit of government that provides a specific public service such as transit housing or health care municipal functions functions that are generally the responsibility of city government such as police fire and trash collection other functions functions that do not qualify as county functions municipal functions or education and that are tracked by the census bureau and analyzed in this report per capita for each person in this report per capita calculations are made by dividing spending or revenue by the population of a city or county tax base the economic activity or wealth available to be taxed by local government in this report tax base is measured as real property value personal income or retail sales per capita tax burden this term can have several definitions in this report it is the overall tax revenue raised within a jurisdiction divided by the total population user charges revenue from charges that are paid by users of a local government service such as trash collection fees highway tolls or transit fares taxes and revenue total revenue for local government entities in philadelphia from all sources including taxes intergovernmental grants and user charges came to 6 303 per capita in fiscal 2015 30 percent higher than the 30 city median and seventh highest among the cities see figure 1 philadelphia s local tax revenue totaled 3 004 per capita in 2015 fifth highest among the 30 comparison cities and 39 percent higher than the median see figure 2 the tax number for philadelphia includes all taxes levied by the city including those dedicated to the school district of philadelphia 2 only new york city san francisco boston and denver collected more three of those four like philadelphia are city counties for philadelphia the largest component of local governmental revenue other than local taxes was state aid the city s local governmental entities received 2 223 per capita in state aid in 2015 65 percent higher than the median see figure 3 because of the census bureau s methodology for reporting state aid this amount includes both state and federal funds that pass through the state government to local jurisdictions other major categories of local revenue in philadelphia were direct federal aid user charges and miscellaneous revenue direct federal aid was 442 per capita 66 percent above the 30 city median user charge revenue was 382 per capita 33 percent below the median miscellaneous revenue including interest earnings fines and revenue from special assessments and asset sales was 252 per capita in philadelphia 13 percent below the median taxes compared with the other cities philadelphia has an unusual tax portfolio although all the comparison fiscs have property taxes and some form of a sales tax only seven have an individual income tax and just four have a corporate income tax philadelphia new york city and louisville kentucky are the only places where local governments receive revenue from all four major tax categories property sales individual income and corporate income philadelphia s local governments are also unusual in terms of how much revenue they receive from these sources thirty five percent of tax revenue is generated by the individual income tax and 10 percent by the corporate income tax local governments in only two of the other 29 cities columbus ohio and louisville kentucky receive a higher percentage of tax revenue from individual income taxes and only new york city collects a greater percentage of tax revenue from corporate taxes and philadelphia s dependence on the property tax is low twenty five percent of tax revenue is generated by the property tax the lowest proportion of any of the cities the median is 65 percent in philadelphia s case several of these taxes are not paid exclusively by city residents taxes imposed by the city on earned income the wage earnings and net profits taxes also apply to nonresidents who work in the city their contributions reduce the tax burden on residents the city s business income and receipts tax applies to all businesses operating within the city intergovernmental aid philadelphia s local governmental entities receive a relatively high level of aid from the federal and state governments 2 665 per capita 52 percent higher than the 30 city median the greatest component of intergovernmental aid is assistance for education 1 189 per capita which exceeds the median by 47 percent overall the pattern of federal and state aid to local government in philadelphia reflects the city s pattern of expenditures high levels of spending in relation to other fiscs for education health and hospitals public welfare housing and community development and mass transit and a lower level for highways these expenditure patterns are described later in the report user charges another source of local revenue is user charges which people pay directly for services they use total user charge revenue in philadelphia was 382 per capita which was 33 percent below the 30 city median philadelphia s user charge revenue was relatively high in transportation related categories fares to use septa s bus and rail services and tolls to cross bridges operated by the delaware river port authority but user charges were low or virtually nonexistent in solid waste management parks and recreation education and housing and community development in many other cities local governments receive higher fee revenue in those areas in addition philadelphia was one of the relatively few cities that do not operate a public hospital hospital charges represent a significant revenue source in some cities see table 2 in the appendix for more detail on revenue sources by city expenditures total expenditures for the local governmental entities serving philadelphia in 2015 were 6 209 per capita 25 percent above the median and eighth highest among the 30 cities these expenditures included spending for most services that are provided by local governments across the comparison cities certain functions that are financed primarily by user fees were excluded from the analysis see the methodology section for more information on the excluded functions expenditures by program the census bureau s statistics on government finances provide information on expenditures across multiple functional categories representing the full range of activity this analysis focuses only on local government functions and divides them into four broad categories municipal county education and other defined as follows municipal police fire solid waste management inspection and regulation parking highways parks and recreation and libraries these are functions generally performed by city or city county governments police fire solid waste management inspection and regulation parking highways parks and recreation and libraries these are functions generally performed by city or city county governments county public welfare health hospitals corrections and judicial and legal all of which are usually the responsibility of county or city county governments public welfare health hospitals corrections and judicial and legal all of which are usually the responsibility of county or city county governments education elementary secondary and higher education elementary secondary and higher education other public transit housing and community development natural resources financial administration multi function public buildings other government administration interest on general debt and other and unallocable expenses 3 the basis of classifying functions into each of these four categories is described in more detail in the methodology as shown in figure 4 philadelphia s county program spending was 1 681 per capita more than twice the median its municipal program spending on the other hand was 1 204 per capita only slightly higher than the median for education and other programs philadelphia s spending was greater than the median but the gap was not as large as in the case of the county programs see table 1 in the appendix for more detail on each city s spending by program category to assess how much each program category contributed to local tax burdens in philadelphia and the other cities pew calculated the level of spending financed by local tax revenues by subtracting user charges as well as federal and state aid from total expenditures 4 in philadelphia local tax supported expenditures are below the median for municipal and education programs and above the median for county and other functions the largest difference between philadelphia and the median is in the county category where philadelphia s total in 2015 was more than twice the median see figure 5 it is important to note that these expenditures do not represent the amount of tax support received from residents only because local taxes may be paid by businesses residents and nonresidents 5 in the sections that follow expenditures within each program category are discussed in more detail municipal programs in philadelphia total spending on municipal programs in 2015 as shown in figure 4 was 1 204 per capita marginally above the median within the municipal category philadelphia s total expenditures for police and solid waste management were relatively high while expenditures for highways and parks and recreation were low expenditures for fire protection and libraries were close to the median see figure 6 data for municipal expenditures in each city are provided in appendix table 3 police philadelphia s expenditures in this category were 517 per capita 27 percent higher than the median the category includes the work of the police department and the medical examiner s office in fiscal 2019 the police department s general fund operating budget was 709 million 6 fire protection in 2015 philadelphia spent 215 per capita for fire protection which is essentially at the median this category includes fire suppression and prevention activites as well as emergency medical services provided by the fire department and the costs of facilities that are exclusively dedicated to fire protection solid waste management this is another category in which philadelphia s costs were relatively high the city s spending of 105 per capita was 41 percent above the median solid waste management includes collection of solid waste and recyclables operation of landfills and incinerators and street cleaning in philadelphia these services are provided by the streets department highways philadelphia spent 120 per capita 42 percent below the median the category includes operation maintenance design and construction of streets highways bridges tunnels and related infrastructure as well as snow removal in philadelphia these functions are performed by the streets department and the delaware river port authority philadelphia s low ranking was due in part to the relatively low expenditures on capital investments local highway capital expenditures were 28 per capita 66 percent below the median in fiscal 2017 the last year for which detailed data were available the streets department s operating expenditures were 56 million for highway programs including road maintenance and repair traffic management street lighting and engineering and design the department s capital spending totaled 32 million for streets highways street lighting and bridge projects 7 parks and recreation philadelphia s expenditure amounted to 69 per capita in 2015 60 percent below the median only louisville and houston spent less in philadelphia this category includes the work of philadelphia parks recreation the office of arts and culture and the creative economy and the city s financial support for the philadelphia museum of art and the pennsylvania convention center libraries philadelphia s public library spending in fiscal 2015 was 53 per capita 6 percent above the median for philadelphia this category covers programs provided by the free library of philadelphia county programs spending for county programs in philadelphia public welfare health courts and corrections was comparatively high variations in spending among cities reflect differences in the need for these services and how much responsibility county governments have in administering and financing these programs in philadelphia high levels of need for human services and criminal justice programs as well as the relatively large role in paying for them that pennsylvania assigns its counties contribute to high county program spending total expenditures for county programs were 1 681 per capita in philadelphia the sixth highest among the 30 cities behind san francisco charlotte north carolina new york city san jose california and denver and more than twice the median amount of 793 per capita for the nine cities in the comparison group that are consolidated city counties the per capita expenditure for county functions is simply the expenditure of the city county government divided by population for the 21 cities that are not city counties the fisc database allocates a portion of county expenditures to the city based on the percentage of county residents who live in the city the total allocated expenditures for each county function are divided by the city s population to determine the per capita spending for that function whether individual programs are run by the counties varies by state as does the amount and distribution of funding provided to pay for them both types of decisions administrative and financial affect the level of tax revenues required to support a program consolidated city counties most american cities are inside a separate county chicago is part of cook county pittsburgh is part of allegheny county residents of these cities pay taxes to both their city and county governments and receive services from both nine of the 30 cities in this report including philadelphia are not part of separate counties they are consolidated city counties which means they must perform all the functions typically handled at the county level such as courts corrections and public health as well as the traditional municipal functions that include police fire and sanitation and they must do so without any financial assistance from county taxes paid by residents and businesses in the surrounding suburbs among the nine city counties in this report five have maintained this status for 100 years or more and are highly urbanized they are baltimore denver new york city which is made up of five counties also known as boroughs philadelphia and san francisco 8 the other four indianapolis jacksonville florida louisville kentucky and nashville tennessee became city counties more recently as a result of mergers between their core cities and the surrounding areas in these cases a few small local jurisdictions remain separate philadelphia s expenditures were high in each of the four categories of county programs expenditures per capita were more than twice the median in public welfare health and hospitals and corrections and 87 percent above the median for judicial and legal programs 9 see figure 7 data for per capita county expenditures in each city are provided in appendix table 4 health and hospitals philadelphia s total expenditures in this category were 932 per capita approximately twice the median this category includes public health substance abuse and behavioral health services community health clinics health related regulation the cost of operating a government s own hospitals and support provided to other public or private hospitals in philadelphia these programs are operated primarily by two departments public health and behavioral health and intellectual disability services philadelphia s relatively high spending in this category reflects its role in administering the behavioral health portion of the medicaid program a role that is unusual among the comparison cities as of july 2015 pennsylvania was one of 13 states that opted to provide behavioral health services under the medicaid program on a carved out basis meaning that services were provided and financed separately from other medical services 10 further the state provides county governments the opportunity to directly administer these services since 1997 philadelphia has administered medicaid behavioral health services through community behavioral health a nonprofit corporation contracted by the city government in fiscal 2015 the city s expenditures for this program exceeded 800 million 11 philadelphia also incurs expenditures for substance abuse and behavioral health services provided outside the medicaid program all pennsylvania counties provide these services which are funded through federal and state grants and local revenues in philadelphia local government s role in providing primary health care is different than in some other jurisdictions twenty of the comparison cities make some expenditures related to public hospitals philadelphia is among the 10 that make no such expenditures it has not operated a public hospital since 1977 when philadelphia general hospital closed 12 it does operate community health centers that provide primary care in neighborhoods public welfare in philadelphia total public welfare expenditures were 282 per capita more than twice the median this category includes cash and in kind assistance programs vendor payments for medical care and other services to children and people in need costs for public welfare institutions such as nursing homes and services for children and the homeless in philadelphia these programs are provided by the city s department of human services office of homeless services and department of public health corrections philadelphia s corrections expenditures were 250 per capita more than twice the median this category covers facilities for detention of adults and juveniles including those awaiting trial and offices of probation and parole in philadelphia these services are the responsibility of the department of prisons the juvenile justice services division of the department of human services and the first judicial district of pennsylvania variations in corrections expenditures among cities reflect differences in the role of local jails as well as differences in the prison populations among the counties that serve the comparison cities philadelphia s incarceration rate in 2015 was the highest 13 jails in philadelphia and throughout pennsylvania house inmates with sentences of up to two years while in other states jails often house only inmates with sentences of no more than one year 14 in all jurisdictions jails house pretrial detainees states also vary in the organization and funding of probation and parole programs 15 administrative responsibility for these programs may reside with a state s department of corrections another state agency county departments of corrections or within the judiciary in pennsylvania probation and parole administration is shared by the state and county governments 16 funding for probation is decentralized in pennsylvania with counties providing more than half the funding for local probation offices in fiscal 2014 17 judicial and legal philadelphia s expenditure for judicial and legal services was 217 per capita 87 percent higher than the median this category covers courts and activities related to courts including prosecuting attorneys public defenders child support enforcement court activities of sheriff s offices register of wills or probate activities and agencies that provide legal services for government itself in philadelphia these services come from the first judicial district of pennsylvania as well as the offices of the district attorney sheriff and register of wills and the law department the city also provides financial support to the defender association of philadelphia a nonprofit organization that offers legal representation for those unable to afford it it is not possible to determine from the census bureau data why philadelphia s expenditures in this category are relatively high although crime and caseloads are likely factors compared with the counties serving the comparison cities philadelphia s violent crime rate was 75 percent above the median and the fifth highest among the 30 counties 18 the differences in spending also reflect variations in court organization and funding in some cities some local court costs are funded directly by the state and are not included in the local court budget for instance in massachusetts the local court system is entirely state funded and there are no local expenditures for judicial programs in pennsylvania the state directly funds salaries and benefits for the judges of the county trial courts and the costs of the statewide court information technology system the state also reimburses counties for certain other court costs that are incurred locally such court costs not reimbursed by the state are funded through a combination of local taxes and revenues from court generated fines and fees education programs philadelphia s education expenditure was 1 689 per capita 9 percent higher than the median 19 the category which primarily covers elementary and secondary education includes instruction school lunch transportation vocational and special education libraries facility maintenance and payments to charter schools 20 in philadelphia these expenditures were made by the school district of philadelphia other programs programs in this category include public transit housing and community development natural resources financial administration multi function public buildings other administration interest on general debt and miscellaneous programs total expenditures on such programs in philadelphia in 2015 were 1 635 per capita 20 percent higher than the median they included expenditures by the city government and the philadelphia housing authority for housing and community development by septa and the delaware river port authority for mass transit and for interest on general debt by the city school district septa and other special districts see appendix tables 1 3 and 4 for additional information on spending in philadelphia and the comparison cities by program category factors influencing philadelphia s taxing and spending patterns multiple factors contribute to philadelphia s taxing and spending patterns among them are the city s relatively high service needs the administrative responsibilities delegated by the state of pennsylvania the costs of labor and fiscal capacity these factors contribute to the city s relatively high spending tax revenues and tax rates need for service the need for service is a critical factor affecting service levels and expenditures two measures of need for local programs are poverty and crime in 2015 philadelphia s poverty rate ranked fourth among the 30 comparison cities behind only detroit milwaukee and memphis tennessee 21 and the city s 2015 violent crime rate was the seventh highest among the 30 cities 22 research suggests that poverty affects not only the need for social programs such as public welfare health and housing but also programs not directly related to poverty such as police and fire services 23 one study on philadelphia found that the cost of poverty related programs to city taxpayers in fiscal 2002 was 343 million 24in 2015 dollars that would be 458 million 25 some of the services that philadelphia provides to low income residents such as child welfare and behavioral health services stem from state mandates and are accompanied by substantial state funding the impact of poverty on local taxes is especially significant in social program areas where the city provides services that are not mandated or fully funded by the federal or state governments two examples are the district health centers and homeless programs on which philadelphia spends 59 million and 81 million respectively the city s decision to provide these programs reflects local officials assessments of the needs of city residents 26 philadelphia s crime rate also affects the need for criminal justice services a 2012 study by the center for american progress found that violent crime in philadelphia resulted in a direct budgetary cost of 351 million for police courts and corrections 27 research conducted outside philadelphia has found that crime rates affect incarceration rates and court caseloads factors that are key drivers of spending for corrections courts prosecutors and public defenders 28 fiscal capacity a second factor that influences spending and taxes is the fiscal capacity of local government fiscal capacity is the amount of resources available to be taxed whether it be individual income business activity real estate or retail sales local governments with high fiscal capacity can provide a high level of services without levying high tax rates three of the major tax bases for the comparison cities are property personal income and sales on each of these measures of fiscal capacity philadelphia is weak consider real estate philadelphia s market value of taxable property per capita was 58 012 in 2015 22 percent below the median of 74 429 among the comparison cities philadelphia ranked 21st in the measure 29 see figure 8 another indicator of the tax base is personal income philadelphia s per capita income in 2015 was 23 961 16 percent below the median of 28 519 among the comparison cities measured against other counties philadelphia s personal income was 20 percent below the median of 29 988 retail sales also are a measure of fiscal capacity local governments in every comparison city rely on a sales tax to generate revenue in 2012 the last year for which comparative data were available philadelphia s retail sales totaled 12 907 per capita 35 percent below the median 30 county responsibilities in pennsylvania state policy also has an impact on local tax and spending patterns in two important areas how much responsibility the state delegates to counties and how much the state funds local governments 31 relative to other states pennsylvania gives its counties a substantial level of administrative and financial responsibility including providing and funding services in public welfare health the local court system and corrections figure 9 shows the percentage of overall spending for county functions assumed by local governments in pennsylvania as well as the median of the 21 states that include at least one of the 30 comparison cities in this report and the median of all 50 states 32 in each program category local governments in pennsylvania are responsible for a greater share of overall state and local direct spending the high level of financial responsibility that pennsylvania delegates to its local governments for these functions directly affects philadelphia city county status as noted earlier philadelphia s spending on county functions in 2015 was high in comparison to other cities the impact of this spending on local taxpayers was heightened by philadelphia s status as a city county city counties must rely on a single tax base to finance both municipal and county functions in other locales county functions are financed by a broader tax base in addition the factors that influence the need for county programs such as those related to poverty and crime may be greater in city counties because they do not include suburbs which generally have lower needs in these areas in terms of the tax base two key measures are the values of taxable real property and personal income among the comparison cities that are not city counties the counties had higher per capita taxable real estate values than the cities inside them in 13 of 21 cases 33 the same was true for the counties per capita personal incomes in terms of the factors that influence the need for services among the 21 cities that are not consolidated city counties the countywide poverty rate was lower than the city poverty rate in every case except el paso texas the countywide crime rate was lower than the city rate in every case city county status may be especially burdensome in philadelphia based on its poverty rate crime level and tax base philadelphia appears confronted by challenges that some of the other city counties do not face among the nine city counties in this study philadelphia s per capita market value of taxable property ranks seventh the city s per capita income was the lowest of the nine city counties see figures 10 and 11 labor costs the cost of labor appears to be a factor in philadelphia s relatively high local government spending primarily due to the cost of employee benefits analysis of census bureau payroll data for philadelphia and comparison cities and counties found salaries for local government employees in philadelphia to be close to the median although somewhat higher for some functions and lower for others 34 see figure 12 philadelphia s pension costs a major component of employee benefits are relatively high in 2015 the average employer contribution per active member for philadelphia s municipal retirement system was 21 718 ranking fifth of 21 cities for which data were available the median among these cities was 15 653 per member see figure 13 35 conclusion this analysis reveals that the high tax burden in philadelphia and the levels of revenue and expenditures that produce that burden is attributable to a variety of factors starting with city county status philadelphia spends more on county programs including public welfare health courts and corrections than most other large cities spending and local funding for municipal programs and public education are not unusual relative to those cities as a city county philadelphia cannot rely on residents of suburban areas which tend to have lower poverty less crime and stronger tax bases to help pay the cost of county functions as is the case in cities that are part of larger counties in addition philadelphia is a city county in a state that has given its counties significant service and financial responsibilities the social and economic realities of the city are important as well high poverty relatively high crime and a relatively weak tax base poverty and crime create a demand for city services a weak tax base affects the ability to pay for those services the challenge for policymakers is to take all these factors into account as they manage philadelphia s fiscal future endnotes

release issued this morning now to begin here is our ceo and president jenniffer deckard jenniffer deckard thanks matt and good morning everyone we appreciate each of you taking the time to join our call today weâ ll start this morning with an overview of our fourth quarter results and andrew will then cover our financials i ll provide an update on more recent market conditions and company focus and then andrew will conclude with our outlook weâ ll begin with a review of 2018 which was a significant year for covia including several key accomplishments first on a pro forma basis we sold 35 2 million tons and generated more than 2 3 billion in sales we expanded our canoitas facility in northern mexico to meet the growing needs of our mexican glass customers we also commissioned three plants to provide 8 million tons of nameplate local in basin production capacity to serve the energy markets in support of these local plants we ve achieved our targeted levels of contracting more than 70 of that capacity with key strategic customers who are industry leaders and our most significant accomplishment was bringing together two industry leading companies to form covia all of which was made possible by the hard work of our dedicated team members and the committed support of our board of directors i m proud to say that we ve made tremendous progress in integrating our business covia team members have concurrently achieved several important accomplishments that lay the foundation for current and future value creation some of these accomplishments include the complete integration of our sales operations and supply chain teams and their associated technology systems and through today we ve integrated approximately 90 of our business by revenue into our consolidated erp platform while there were many benefits from the combination one of the primary drivers was to create a unique flexible and low cost business model with balance and diversity both between our two segments and within each of our segments themselves as profit supply began to rapidly outpace demand in mid 2018 we underscored this flexibility when we quickly idled nearly 7 million tons of capacity within our energy segment and consolidated production into our most efficient and competitive assets as overall market prices and volumes declined we leveraged that network of assets to strengthen our competitive position and to grow market share for 2018 our diverse and sizable industrial segment posted solid overall revenues and generated very attractive cash flow throughout the year however despite this top line growth gross margins for our industrial business were below our expectations due to a few key factors first our mexican business posted solid growth in overall revenues but was adversely impacted by above average general cost inflation and in particular in utilities a devaluation of the peso and high interim costs prior to the full commercial expansion of our canoitas facility in the us we saw higher operating costs at many of our hybrid plants that serve both our industrial and our energy customers particularly in the third and fourth quarter as energy volumes fell quickly additionally certain industrial sites had higher than normal stripping and contractor costs throughout the year our operations teams have made several adjustments to better align our capacity to overall market demand and to recalibrate those production sites that were impacted by higher costs in 2018 thus improving our cost position as we will move through 2019 turning to our energy segment we estimate overall market volumes to decline nearly 20 sequentially in the fourth quarter exiting at an annualized run rate in the high 60 million ton range despite this sharp market decline our volumes were down modestly with 4 4 million energy tons sold during the quarter representing what we believe to be a meaningful increase in market share for covia several factors both positively and negatively impacted these results first our kermit and seiling facilities had slower than expected ramp up which impacted both our volume growth and our overall costs during the quarter at kermit operational challenges associated with ramping the plant limited our production and our fixed costs leverage including an elevated cost of powering the plant with generators before connecting to the utility grid in november at seiling freezing weather delayed the plant completion and the scaling of production resulting in lower sales volumes and higher costs these issues have also persisted throughout most of the first quarter however we ve achieved significant improvement in march and we expect to reach our full production capacity by the end of the second quarter for all three of our local sand plants and importantly we expect our costs to come in line with our long term expectations concurrent with this volume ramp notwithstanding these challenges our local sand facilities did continue to ramp up throughout the fourth quarter and sold over 700 000 tons during the quarter which is an increase of over 500 000 tons compared to the third quarter these volumes helped to offset decreased volumes from our voca plant which we began to idle during the fourth quarter as well as lower volumes from our northern white facilities in addition to the incremental local capacity our northern white plants performed well in the fourth quarter relative to the overall market and contributed to our solid results we continued to sell northern white sand into every major basins including those that have access to local sand and with our low cost facilities balanced rail exposure unit train capabilities and expansive logistics network we re well positioned to serve our customer base at a competitive overall price gain share and to generate sustainable margins on our northern white sand finally our cross functional teams did an excellent job of understanding our customer needs and leveraging coviaâ s strength in order to deliver the proper solutions to address those needs we credit them for a solid fourth quarter performance particularly in light of the more challenging market conditions within the energy segment i m happy to now turn the call over to andrew to cover the financial results andrew eich thanks jenniffer good morning everyone for the total company fourth quarter revenue totaled 441 3 million compared to 523 4 million in the third quarter this sequential decline was due primarily to lower profit and pricing while the typical seasonal slowdown in our industrial business also had a more modest impact reported gross profit totaled 81 8 million in the fourth quarter which was a decrease from the third quarter of 117 8 million the fourth quarter figure includes 8 1 million in losses related to the ramping of production at our seiling and kermit facilities and 3 6 million in non cash purchase accounting adjustments the rest of the sequential decline was driven primarily by lower profit pricing and fixed cost leverage at our northern white facilities moving to segment performance and beginning first with industrial fourth quarter 2018 revenues were 185 7 million an increase of 3 7 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 aided primarily by higher average selling prices compared to 2017 industrial gross profit was 50 5 million and includes 1 1 million in non cash inventory charges related to purchase accounting this compares to 53 9 million in gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to the purchase accounting charges and as jenniffer also mentioned costs at our hybrid facilities also increased due to lower energy volumes which led to lower fixed cost utilization in our energy segment revenues totaled 255 6 million in the fourth quarter a decrease of 69 million sequentially this decrease was due to a mix shift towards sales at the mine which carry a lower average selling price as well as reduced northern white pricing we believe market pricing for northern white reached a bottom in early 2019 energy gross profit was 31 3 million during the quarter or approximately 7 20 per ton these figures include 2 5 million in purchase counting charges or nearly 0 60 per ton the decline in profitability was driven primarily by lower northern white pricing primarily resulting from having the full quarter impact of pricing concessions which were made in the third quarter which was offset somewhat by the idling of higher costs facilities additionally our results were negatively impacted by the 8 1 million in negative margins at our seiling and kermit facilities as they started and scaled production during the quarter sg a for the quarter was 45 8 million which included 2 4 million of non cash stock compensation and 1 9 million of integration expenses adjusted ebitda totaled 43 9 million for the fourth quarter this figure includes 8 1 million in negative margins at kermit and seiling as i previously mentioned as well as 3 6 million in purchase accounting charges these items were partially offset by the positive impact of a 5 million valuation adjustment of a contingent liability in the fourth quarter we had a tax expense of 4 5 million at the end of december we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately 300 million that can be utilized to offset future taxable income in the us which will result in minimal cash taxes paid in future periods additionally we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately 18 million in 2019 due to revised tax liabilities from prior years this refund will be largely offset by expected international tax payments during the year operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was 57 1 million turning to the balance sheet capital expenditures were 75 6 million in the fourth quarter primarily for the completion of our local sand facilities the capex figure was above our previous guidance of 50 million to 55 million due to the acceleration of planned 2019 spending in to 2018 as well as unforeseen spending associated with the ramping of our in basin plants these items have resulted in our 2019 forecast for capex to range between 80 million and 100 million versus the previously provided 90 million to 110 million we ended the quarter with 322 million in liquidity including 134 million of cash and 188 million in availability on our revolver as you may have noticed from our the 8 k we filed this morning we recently amended the terms of our revolving credit agreement to raise the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio covenants to 6 6 times in 2019 5 5 times in 2020 versus the 4 times under the original agreement importantly we have maintained the full 200 million facility with no change to the interest rates spread providing us with substantial liquidity and flexibility if needed our term loan had a balance of 1 63 billion at the end of the year and as a reminder the term loan matures in 2025 and does not have any covenants now iâ ll turn the call over to jenniffer who will provide an update on our markets and on key strategic initiatives jenniffer deckard thanks andrew i ll begin with our industrial segment where 2019 volumes have been relatively flat to prior year thus far stronger overall volumes in our combined glass markets have been offset by a bit softer volumes on a few other end markets including our ceramics and sports and recreation markets to start the year one particular market in which we see continued strength is containerized glass in our mexico markets in addition to completed 2018 expansion project at our canoitas facility which i mentioned earlier we ve also recently commenced an additional expansion project to meet further customer demand for our products in this region canoitas is a prime example of how our long history of commitment and partnership with our industrial customers both within and across cyclical periods are great mutual benefit for both parties over the long term moving to our energy segment the demand softness that we saw at the end of 2018 continued through january and february as operators were slow to get back to work from lower commodity prices at the end of 2018 additionally exceptionally cold temperatures throughout much of the us hampered completion activities for customers in several basins this weather also impacted operations at our plants in the north while we were successful in moving volumes our costs were negatively impacted by these events as well as by annual freight rate increases throughout march we ve seen volumes pick up noticeably and are expecting double digit sequential volume growth in the second quarter for our energy segment overall we believe market demand for proppant in the first quarter will be at an average run rate in the low 70 million ton range only modestly above the high 60s we saw in the fourth quarter however we believe the market is exiting first quarter at an annualized run rate in the low 80 million ton per year range and as weather conditions improve we expect proppant demand in the second quarter will continue to accelerate into the mid 90 million annualized ton range turning to supply we believe the unsustainably low market pricing in the fourth quarter resulted in additional higher cost supply exiting the market either through the idling of plants or de rating of capacity we estimate between 20 million and 25 million tons of supply have come offline since june of last year and this figure is slightly conservative as additional facilities have likely de rated capacity but which is more difficult to precisely track also we believe that some higher cost supply has remained in the market as winter stockpiles are drawn down and which may move to additional supply reductions as these stockpiles are exhausted and investments must be reconsidered with this contraction of supply and with demand improving we ve seen early signs of market stabilization for northern white toward the end of the first quarter we instituted a modest price increase on northern white sand while relatively small the price increases is a positive step and furthers our belief that we ve seen a bottom in northern white sand pricing and that customers also value the complete solutions that we can provide as we enter the second quarter we expect additional price increases these operational advances for covia combined with strong market dynamics and a strengthening price environment should provide positive overall tailwinds into the second quarter for local sand there continues to be additional supply entering the market although the pace of these additions has begun to slow and the ultimate effective utilization of nameplate capacity remains yet to be seen we believe the oversupply of local sand in the permian will likely persist throughout 2019 in order to navigate this environment weâ ve contracted more than 70 of our nameplate capacity under long term agreements with customers who value coviaâ s complete product portfolio and ability to consistently deliver solutions as we discussed in our last call we believe that the long term demand mix between northern white and local sand has yet to settle out third party lab results have indicated that the shape and polycrystalline structure inherent in local sand results in a lower crush strength and greater finds generation compared to northern white these factors may lead to conductivity issues in certain well environments particularly in areas with higher closure stress such as in the delaware basin while many customers have converted to regional sand there are also customers who continue to see the value in pumping northern white sand either in total or in wells where local sands are less fit for purpose for these customers they expect that the use of northern white sand particularly for higher pressure wells will result in a higher return for wells and we have continued to sign new contracts for northern white sand during the first quarter as such we continue to believe that demand in basins with local sand availability will continue to be served by a mix of both local sand and northern white sand further enhancing our customer value proposition is our ability to now offer last mile solutions were needed we placed our first last mile system this quarter and through an asset light model we will continue to offer leading options to those customers who prefer that the last mile solution be provided by the sand supplier lastly our balanced product solution consisting of local sand in two basins low cost northern white supply value added products low cost unit train capabilities on five different class 1 railroads and mine to well capability strongly position us to meet the needs of our customers wherever and whatever they may be and as i previously mentioned we re exiting the first quarter in a stronger position from where we began the year regarding the ramp of our local sand capacities which will set the foundation for both higher volumes and improved costs as we enter the second quarter as we think about our overall priorities for 2019 our focus is on execution of our base business including the leveraging of our recent investments in both industrial and energy capacities and on overall cash generation and net debt reduction we further anticipate that the completion of our erp platform consolidation will drive added cost savings through advancing our remaining organizational integration enabling greater spend analysis and margin optimization and improving our working capital management we also expect to significantly reduce our 2019 capital spending these measures underscore our commitment to reducing net debt in 2019 and coupled with our well positioned energy assets and our large and predictable industrial business we re confident that we have a pathway to accomplish this goal with that i d like to turn the call back over to andrew to provide our more specific outlook andrew eich thanks jenniffer starting with industrial we anticipate that first quarter 2019 volumes will be approximately 3 5 million tons relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2018 for the second quarter we expect industrial volumes to be 3 8 million tons or relatively similar to the prior year period at the beginning of 2019 we instituted a low single digit percentage price increase on average across our portfolio in line with prior years for energy we expect volumes in the first quarter to be approximately 4 4 million tons or similar to the fourth quarter march volumes are expected to be significantly stronger than january or february we anticipate margins in the first quarter to be down approximately 3 to 3 5 per ton driven by slight declines in pricing and higher overall costs these cost increases will be partially offset by improving operating performance of our local facilities which are rapidly increasing production as we look forward into the second quarter we expect energy volumes to range between 5 million and 5 3 million tons which represents double digit percentage sequential growth in both northern white and local sand we also anticipate that improving volumes will allow us to further increase prices for our northern white sand particularly for those locations where we saw freight rate increases at the beginning of the year we also expect the higher monthly northern white volumes we also expect the higher monthly northern white volumes better weather conditions and the ramp up of our new local facilities to largely reverse the cost headwinds we experienced in the first quarter for the full year we anticipate sg a will total 160 million to 170 million which includes approximately 10 million in non cash stock compensation this represents a reduction of 18 million to 28 million from the 2018 sg a levels excluding integration costs finally and as i mentioned earlier capital expenditures are expected to be 80 million to 100 million for the full year 2019 a reduction from our previous guidance as some of the spending occurred in 2018 back to you jenniffer jenniffer deckard thanks andrew i ll conclude our prepared remarks today by saying that our industrial markets remain strong and while the energy market remains dynamic we re encouraged that recent trends and momentum bode well for the coming quarters and the outlook for covia our diversified business model combined with our firm commitment to maximizing cash generation and de leveraging our balance sheet will continue to position covia for success before we take questions i d like to again thank our covia team members many of whom are continuing to do double duty of integrating the company while also ensuring that we re meeting and exceeding our customersâ needs in order to remain a leader in our industry with that leandra could you please open the line for questions question and answer session operator and our first question comes from the line of kurt hallead with rbc kurt hallead thank you for that detailed update you gave great color regarding the progression as you head out into the first half of the year i was really curious about the dynamics around your commentary on northern white pricing and what do you think the primary drivers of that pricing dynamic are is it just simply the fact that youâ ve had idle capacity or is it the fact that you ve seen also growing demand i guess i m just trying to gauge whether it s more supply or whether itâ s a combination of increasing demand along with the lower supply jenniffer deckard for the first quarter well i think it s a combination of both kurt and i think most recently it s the increase in demand because we saw that capacity come out across the last six months and i think it s also outlook and i would also say an important factor is the position of our assets because whether that s through the actual price that we pass on to the customer or the leverage and cost reduction that they get on their end from using our assets i think that it s those three things we do believe that the total market is going to be up as i mentioned in both the first and second quarter kurt hallead great thank you appreciate that and then maybe quick follow up for andrew you mentioned contribution margin per ton being down 3 to 3 50 sequentially in the first quarter just want to be sure was that were you referencing energy specific on that andrew eich yeah kurt thatâ s correct energy specifically operator your next question comes from the line of harry pollans with bank of america merrill lynch harry pollans just to clarify on the energy contribution margin per ton guidance is that off of the clean contribution margin per ton for 4q like excluding the startup costs and the non cash inventory charges andrew eich yeah so that what i would say there harry is i would that s off of the purchase accounting adjusted figures so what we would expect over the course of q1 is we saw some higher costs in our northern white facilities because of the weather related challenges that jenniffer mentioned particularly in january and february we also experienced freight rate increases down our railed lanes and then that will be offset in part by our expansion of volumes in west texas which are improving our unit costs there as well as in oklahoma with our seiling facility but all in all the gross margin per ton is across all of the tons and it s on the clean number after the purchase accounting adjustment harry pollans okay so we should be adding back the startup costs in 4q and go off that andrew eich no you shouldn t so that you should not be adding that back harry pollans okay got it and then just one more on the northern white pricing increases is that mesh specific and could you clarify the magnitude of those price increases or is that across all of your mesh size jenniffer deckard the price increase is across generally all of the product categories clearly it was a modest price increase as we mentioned and we certainly can t quantify yet the first quarter because we re actively in those discussions what i would say is that we understand the complexity of the many moving parts here which is why we ve tried to quantify it from a margin perspective for you because we recognize there s many moving parts here and that includes so the margin includes both our price and cost expectations harry pollans and then with â so i guess sneaking one more how much startup costs do you expect in 1q do you expect it to be up or down andrew eich no we would expect that to come down yeah we would expect that to come down quite a bit that s been built into the guidance that we ve provided so we do expect that to come down as our volumes ramp up quickly in the first quarter operator and your next question comes from the line of mike urban with seaport global mike urban i wonder if you could talk to us a little bit about your contracting strategy in the past you guys have kind of shied away from especially take or pay contracts just given the tendency for them to go away whenever it s not beneficial for the customers it sounds like you are contracting more volumes i mean are those take or pay or are those essentially volume agreements with some price variability if you could just give us a little bit sense of kind of what those contain and your thoughts here going forward on those contracts jenniffer deckard we actually maintain a similar position in that the majority of our contracts are a function of market price we do have a degree call it 20 to 25 probably in fixed costs and or indexed but we continue to believe that that those contracts even while fixed or indexed you need to help your customers to be competitive and so we believe that market based contracts provide the most flexibility and align ourselves with our customers the best mike urban and then on the last mile you said you deployed your first last mile solution how many more do you expect to deploy here over the either the course of the quarter or the year jenniffer deckard itâ s a great question it s certainly a moving target our strategy is to provide those solutions where the customer really is desiring that to be provided integrated with the sand business we believe thatâ s a small percentage of the market and so we don t expect this to become a big growth driver although it will generate some margins for us our strategy is to make sure that we maximize our addressable market for sand mike urban okay and i think you just stressed it there but so you are capturing some margin there i mean given that you have the kind of the asset light model presumably you re going to have to pay a third party for some of these assets and they ll capture some margin so do you think you re capturing some net margin there and it s not necessarily just a volume driver so in other words they prefer to have sand from covia and as long as you provide the last mile they ll do that but you re able to capture some margin on top of that andrew eich yeah so our primary goal with the last mile the asset light last mile solution is to offer multiple solutions to the customer base to provide them with the flexibility weâ re not doing it as a major margin contributor to our business now having said that we will earn some margin but we don t anticipate it being a huge growth driver for our business in 2019 operator your next question comes from the line of chris voie with wells fargo chris voie just curious within the guidance getting to 5 million to 5 3 million tons in 2q can you give a sense of what s baked into that in terms of in basin versus northern white does that assume that all the growth comes from in basin or potentially even further decline for northern white volumes in there just given the industry shift or maybe just a little more color on that andrew eich yes sure so i would say that we re expecting in q2 double digit percentage increases in both northern white and local sand so you will see from a percentage basis you re going to see a higher percentage of northern or excuse me of local sand growth that s because we re ramping up the facilities but we are expecting a meaningful uptick in northern white sand as well and so that s really driven by the overall growth we re seeing in the market chris voie okay that s helpful and then within the in basin market can you give a sense of what kind of specific pricing trends youâ re seeing not just for yourself but where maybe a sense of where the spot market is for in basin in terms of just on the pricing level how that has declined quarter over quarter and maybe if you see any kind of premium for your contracts versus where the market is currently andrew eich sure it s a good question so iâ d make a few comments here one is that we re more than 70 contracted in our local sand markets that we re selling into i d also say that over the last six months or so we ve seen pricing for our customer base declining roughly 10 to 12 including q1 and that s also been factored into our guidance as well unlike northern white sand we don t anticipate pricing opportunities in these markets given the supply situation and the meaningful capacity that keeps coming on but offsetting that to some extent are going to be some of these startup challenges that have been ramping across the industry so it s a bit hard to gauge the overall capacity effective capacity that s going to be selling into these local markets but i would say that we really don t anticipate pricing improvement in â 19 unlike northern white where we think that market is a bit more stabilized operator your next question comes from the line of harry pollans with bank of america merrill lynch harry pollans hey guys just one more talk a bit about permian pricing in basin and the delta between the spot and the contracted pricing trends right now jenniffer deckard sure harry good morning as andrew mentioned and as i mentioned in our comments all the predominance of our products are going to our contracted customers and so we really are not participating in the spot market and so it s probably difficult for us to comment other than that we ve seen the 10 to 12 decline over the last six month period andrew eich and i think the spot market pricing is i think very misleading because a lot of spot market pricing is driven by the fire selling of production if your silos are getting nearly full and you need to offload inventory you ll see spot pricing drop â can drop significantly relative to what you might sell larger more consistent volumes at so i think it s a bit misleading to look at that as an indicator of where overall pricing is going to go harry pollans and then for seiling have you guys had you said 70 contracted across all your in basin mines is that on average or are you guys having trouble at locking up any capacity at seiling as in basin mines start ramping up there jenniffer deckard that is on average but all of our plants including seiling are at or above our targeted 70 operator and we have no further questions at this time i ll turn the call back to jenniffer deckard for closing remarks jenniffer deckard okay thanks leandra and thanks to all of you for listening and participating today and we look forward to meeting with many of you over the next coming week so have a great day everyone and thanks very much operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect

system as he narrates the video at the start of my government i promised decisive action to promote tourism today we re achieving that he explains the crowd tucked into the square patio in a small strip mall next to the hotel watches a promotional clip s opening sequence shot from a helicopter the footage shows sweeping views of the hotel towers along acapulco bay and the formidable cliffs that rise of from the ocean on the other side of the peninsula the water a fluorescent shade of turquoise looks warm and inviting from the sky the view of the old part of the city is captivating frothy blue water washes against the rocks in private coves i ve ridden inside of a federal police helicopter as it swooped over the brightly painted cement buildings in the residential neighborhoods that pack the steep hills above the beach from the air the army patrol trucks look like tiny toys and the danger seems far away photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram evodio replaced luis walton a politician working with a small party called the citizen s movement in three years in office walton was never able to bring acapulco s gangs under control or catalyze a major wave of new investment in the city s tourism economy evodio ran on a ticket backed by the leftist prd and the worker s party he beat out a lack luster candidate from the pri and is now facing down a pri controlled state government with a relatively weak political faction behind him evodio knows he was elected into a city in crisis hammered by a series of hurricanes a chain of protests and a surge in violent attacks by criminal groups acapulco s economy is at a breaking point evodio took over as mayor and is tasked with the impossible rebuilding the tourist economy in a city that has displaced ciudad juarez and become the most violent town in mexico the day before the crowne plaza event criminals had set fire to and destroyed an eatery owned by a popular local restaurant chain called los buzos a day before that police found the body of a twenty year old woman dumped in a trashcan but so far tourists have been coming in by the thousand and evodio and his team are confident that easter week will be a success in mexico the crucifixion and resurrection of christ is celebrated with reenactments and parades behind christmas it s the most second most important vacation week of the year a time for families and friends to gather celebrate and relax the toll booths leading into the city are calculating that nineteen cars are entering the city every minute and so far the city has achieved an 82 percent occupancy rate major hotel chains such as hyatt marriott and wyndham are still waiting for more meaningful long term recovery evodio is confident that like monterrey and ciudad juarez acapulco can bounce back from its problems with organized crime and violence the challenge however is that unlike those cities in northern mexico acapulco and more generally the state of guerrero has no strong industrial base eight out of ten of the state s residents work in the informal economy a higher rate than in chiapas oaxaca or any other state in mexico guerrero also has the third highest poverty rate in mexico more than 65 percent of the state s residents live in poverty and around 900 000 people who live in guerrero struggle daily with extreme poverty many of the small mountain towns outside of acapulco are home to some of the worst poverty in the western hemisphere monterrey by contrast is the wealthiest city in mexico the city s big businesses collaborated with the state government to recruit and train a new military style police force monterrey is now at peace even ciudad juarez has come back to life after clamping down on street crime and violence acapulco on the other hand is still languishing like a small sailboat tethered to a large anchor flailing in a storm acapulco s tourism sector is the central force in the entire state s economy and it competes directly with drug production smuggling and other rackets as the main source of income for most residents when cartels turned ciudad juarez and monterrey into war zones local authorities just had to convince foreign businesses that they would be safe operating behind heavy duty security fences on industrial compounds acapulco faces the impossible task of going to war with criminal groups while also convincing the tourists that the city is a safe fun and relaxing place to visit even as violence creeps into tourist destinations such as cancun los cabos and acapulco more people from the u s still visit mexico than any other foreign country including canada in 2015 despite all of the concerns about violence in mexico 28 million people from the u s traveled south across the border by 2017 the yearly total of us visitors increased to 35 million despite concerns about violent crime tourists from the us are still interested in visiting mexico photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram the center of the storm in recent years acapulco has earned the unfortunate reputation of being the one of the most violent cities in the country within mexico no tourism destination has seen its reputation hurt worse by violence in 2017 mexico recorded a record breaking 29 168 homicides the state of guerrero logged 2 529 murders nearly a thousand of which occurred in acapulco a chilean tourist was killed in january 2018 caught in the crossfire in gang related shooting in april 2018 a man was murdered in broad daylight on la caleta one of the city s signature beaches by the end of 2018 874 people were killed in acapulco the violence has continued in february 2019 a tourist from the u s was shot and killed over the past decade violent crime has emerged as one of acapulco s defining characteristics the challenge for acapulco when i met with evodio in early 2016 i saw firsthand how the security dynamic in acapulco made promoting fun in the sun for visiting tourists a sisyphean challenge for him and his staff standing before the crowd evodio listens to a few speakers the construction of new acapulco will take time but we are taking the first steps one man says people in the crowd nod in agreement government isn t sufficient to fix the problems another man warns evodio listens with the preliminary speeches out of the way evodio steps up to the microphone today is an important day today tourism is the motor of the economy in acapulco he says the price of oil is down and mexico s federal government has seen its budget squeezed the federal police haven t paid the bills for their hotel stays in over two years with the peso down consumer sales have been hit by the rising cost of imported goods the peso is the weakest its been relative to the dollar and for the first time in history mexico s central bank calculated that remittances from migrant workers from places like chiapas oaxaca guerrero michoacan and jalisco have actually topped oil export revenues as the largest single source of foreign exchange for mexico s economy but the strong dollar could also work to acapulco s advantage the exchange rate makes vacationing in mexico less expensive for foreign visitors today acapulco has the chance to show tourism is a tool for development acapulco is ready to start a new reality evodio says he doesn t use notes or a teleprompter he knows what he wants to say he is resolute it s complex but there are a lot of good things in acapulco it s time to build a new reality in acapulco tangible actions that can be felt he says i want to salute the solidarity of the mexican army who is with us today i want to recognize the work the three levels of government are doing together in the area of tourism we re taking steps forward we re ready to do things differently he adds speaking forcefully and looking out at the crowd evodio declares today acapulco is changing today acapulco is repositioning evodio is sure his city is ready to rebound today we need to reposition our city in its level of competitiveness on the global stage i ve been to beautiful places with better security sure but not more beautiful than acapulco he says i want to ask for your trust we ve got a lot of things to do he adds in addition to promoting acapulco s newest developments evodio wants to burnish the city s unique history acapulco tradicional the u shaped peninsula that juts out into the sea and protects the western flank of the bay is girded by sandstone cliffs and pockmarked with private coves and inlets it s a refuge from the traffic and bustle of the city center but it isn t immune to the spats of violence that still affect the rest of the city photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram we ll work to maintain our traditional zone with its history and architectural brand the boca chica flamingos i m talking about what acapulco represents to the country and the world he declares while the isolated and flat beaches of acapulco s upscale and modern diamantes section which is located near the airport a half an hour s drive away from the city center offers visitors an experience comparable to the beaches in ft lauderdale cancun and countless other coastal cities it s the old hotels such as the boca chica and flamingos that set acapulco apart evodio is working to preserve and promote that history together we ll recuperate the traditional area of acapulco we are recovering he promises he knows he faces a real challenge but has an unwavering commitment to tackling the problems head on the only thing we know how to do is work for the well being of acapulco he says finishing his speech and walking away from the mic evodio makes his way through the front doors of the office followed by the phalanx of photographers snapping pictures and an entourage from the crowd the stage is now empty but the white backdrop emblazoned with the brightly colored words building a new acapulco still stands blocking the view of an empty storefront the shop s glass windows have been partially covered with old newspapers one paper taped to the window shows a headline that screams in bright red block letters taxi driver killed the photo shows one of acapulco s emblematic blue and white vw beatles decorated with orange cones marking shell casings another page on the window shows three stories of different murders each accompanied by a photo of a bloody cadaver the biggest story is from the tabloid novedades de acapulco it s hung front and center in the window international tourism is agonizing because of bad promotion of the port direct flights are just from mexico city monterrey and guadalajara even though 18 cruise ships will visit this year they ll just be here for a few hours longstanding challenges in the hills that gird acapulco locals have become accustomed to violence in the 1970s the leftist guerrilla movements based there were joined by a new generation of drug smuggling gangsters it wasn t until 2009 however when things really started to take a turn for the worse while serving in a variety of public offices evodio saw the collapse in acapulco firsthand evodio was elected to mexico s congress in 2006 he made his way to the capital at the same time that felipe calderon a conservative technocrat from the right of center pan party took over mexico s executive office when he became president in 2006 calderon jumped at the chance to send soldiers out into the streets and declare war on mexico s drug cartels he draped a bulky military jacket over his tailored blue oxford dress shirt and pulled an army cap over his delicate wire framed glasses and signed an order to send mexican troops into the pacific coast state of michoacan which sits directly north of guerrero the effort was meant to shore up confidence in mexico s government instead it made many would be visitors and investors think mexico was a warzone like george bush when he made his ill fated foray into iraq calderon was quick to laud his own successes but as was the case in the case with bush and his middle eastern adventure calderon found that it is easy to deploy troops and much harder to coordinate with local leaders to build lasting institutions the situation on the ground in places such as acapulco deteriorated quickly in december of 2009 a squadron of several hundred police officers descended on a luxury apartment complex in cuernavaca a city that sits a few hours drive inland from acapulco in the neighboring state of morelos after a prolonged shootout they killed arturo the beard beltran leyva the leader of the cartel that had controlled the drug trade in acapulco on the day of the operation calderón addressed the public i want to recognize the valiant work of the army that has shown once more with s actions that it s at the front lines to defend mexican families from the actions of criminals in 2010 federal police officers paraded eduardo la barbie villareal a u s citizen who took over acapulco after allegedly helping mexican authorities locate and take out beltran leyva on the same day as villareal s arrest calderón addressed mexico s public he did not directly mention the operation that led to villareal s capture but he did say it s important that states and towns also strengthen their own police forces because nine out ten of the police in mexico are local police especially because robbery extortion kidnapping and other local crimes represent 90 percent of the crimes that most hurt citizens more than halfway through his term in office calderon had realized that his military strategy wasn t working taking out cartel kingpins wasn t enough mexico s government had to also build up local police forces starting in mid 2010 following the arrest of villareal acapulco s murder rate jumped to an average of seventy two per month with the beard and la barbie off of the playing field splinter groups and local gangs began to fight for control of different sections of the city and the myriad criminal rackets in each area mexico s federal government smashed the big and powerful cartels but for residents the new crop of pistol packing thugs is probably worse now instead of fighting for the control of smuggling routes local gangsters are preying on and killing taxi drivers and storeowners squeezing the struggling legal economy for whatever it can offer while the military and police took down leaders mexico s justice system and local police forces remain corrupt and unwieldy by most estimates 99 percent of all crime in mexico goes unpunished in 2015 nearly six out of every ten mexicans reported that a member of their family had been a victim of a crime hinting at a level of criminality that is more than 50 percent higher than the regional average for latin america despite all of the ephemeral successes in the war against the drug cartels the fight against more common crime continues to drag on on june 7 2009 gunmen from the beltran leyva group engaged in a four hour gunfight with more than two hundred soldiers and federal police tourists staying nearby reported heavily armed gunmen in luxury suvs shooting machine guns and firing grenade launchers the confrontation started with a chase that began near the scene playa angosta beach in acapulco tradicional near the hotel mirador and ended with a pitched battle in front of the old bull ring near caletilla beach near the boca chica hotel soldiers surrounded the area and hid for cover behind palm trees as they advanced as the battle raged soldiers in hummers and local police officers stormed in to round up the guests staying at the nearest hotel and move them to safety when the shooting stopped police counted nineteen cadavers photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram over the next few years as soldiers and federal police continued to capture and kill many cartel kingpins and senior lieutenants the dynamic in acapulco has shifted away from military style confrontations between highly trained and heavily armed cartel commandos and evolved into a slow burning pattern of constant conflict between pistol packing gangsters when evodio came into office it was still common to hear about weekends in which ten or even twenty people were killed in separate incidents in acapulco on march 20 2016 the start of easter week gunmen attacked a party in a town outside acapulco five people were killed including a 16 year old girl and a 42 year old musician who was playing music at the fiesta prosecutors claimed the hitmen were targeting members of a local group of gangsters it continues to be challenging to attract foreign tourists into a city that still sometimes feels like an active battlefield the mirador hotel in the late morning melchor gonzalez the stoic square faced 53 year old manager at the historic hotel mirador stands by the empty saltwater pool and listens to the water crash and dissipate against the thick rocks in the sea wall up above in the cliff top parking lot several dozen federal police officers carrying machine guns gather for a morning meeting tucked into a small cove below the steep walls of the cliffs melchor can t hear any activity on the street the pool is still partially covered with a dark shadow as the sun rises above the towering hotel which is connected by steep staircases and built directly into the rocky precipice rising from the sea the rays of light pierce through the soap scum like froth on the surface of the green seawater illuminating the immaculate white sand below a few fish swim lazily through the shallow water and a group of crabs scavenge for the sun s warmth on the rocks as is the case on most mornings the pool like most of the rooms in the hotel is empty photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram melchor nods at the rippling water this is more recent from the 70s and 80s it s newer he says the cement on the dock next to the pool is crumbling and the paint on the adjacent thatched roof lookout tower has long since faded looking at the pool melchor explains that s the main attraction it s a little risky when the waves jump but when it s tranquil it s enjoyable there are crabs small manta rays and there are colorful fish red yellow and blue fish there s a big one he says pointing to a banana colored fish swimming languidly under the rippling surface of the water turning and looking up at the white walls of the hotel rooms melchor squints and peers upward shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand the hotel rises up from the sea connected by a series of zig zagging steep staircases a few small rooms are built right into the lower sections of the cliff and higher up where the space allows the hotel has expanded into separate blocks of multi story sections with balconies that look out and over the sea the cement and stone walls are white and the some of the accents have been painted a deep burnt red the roof shingles are spanish style red clay tiles a tribute to the conquerors who built the colonial fort that once sat in the same location in 1933 the hotel started being built on the cliff by the first owner the hotel was built on la quebrada where the muchachos jump it s built on the precipice it s known around the world for the divers he says most nights foreign tourists from hotels in other areas of the city gather in el mirador s restaurant to watch young acapulco men climb up the cliff and leap off the precipice free falling for several seconds of silent graceful flight before crashing into the water nearly 140 feet below the first highway connecting mexico city to the coast in guerrero opened in the 1920s but it wasn t until the dust settled from the mexican revolution that acapulco started to grow the international airport was opened in 1953 and el mirador quickly became a major draw for mexico city s economic and political elites the hotel however has seen better days melchor nods towards a row of units halfway up the cliff those rooms they are out of service now the salt from the sea hits them hard they have to be remodeled every five ten years they need to be remodeled because we are right on the edge of the sea the salt hurts the buildings he says the repairs are just part of doing business in the hospitality sector melchor who previously worked in the tourist city of puerto vallarta another favorite place for visitors from the u s is familiar with the general challenges of the hotel industry acapulco however presents a unique set of difficulties speaking with a tired resignation about the current reality melchor explains the biggest problem we have is crime it s affected us a lot in terms of occupancy photo by n parish flannery instagram nathanielparish the convenience store next to the hotel displays copies of el sol de acapulco one of the city s main papers the cover shows a photo of a row of green army trucks including two hulking mine resistant military vehicles that are bigger than bank trucks and topped with turrets that house massive machine guns the trucks were decorated with signs that say operation easter week 2016 the headline declares vigilance reinforced more than four thousand gunmen will guard tourist sites during vacation the heavy military presence doesn t instill a lot of confidence one day earlier all of the local newspapers published stories documenting the previous day s grotesque series of crimes the cover of the police section of el sol showed a chilling photo of a man s head surrounded by green leaves along with the headline two rotting heads discovered in renacimiento other headlines announced the murder of a woman killed by a machete wielding attacker and the death of a fruit vendor who was shot and killed by two young men on a motorcycle at 1 30 pm in a busy business district a few blocks from the beach another headline announced victim of attack at taxi stand taxi driver shot on costera dies at hospital the man had been shot in broad daylight on the busy avenue by the beach a few days earlier aside from the story about the arrival of the army s heavy artillery today s headlines are more pedestrian a man attacked by assassins with nine millimeter pistols in a residential acapulco neighborhood died of his injuries police issued an amber alert for a 15 year old girl who went missing two days earlier detectives are investigating new leads in the murder of the head of the trauma surgery department at the vicente guerrero regional hospital who was killed while driving on cuauhtemoc avenue one of the principal roads that runs through the main business district in acapulco melchor doesn t check the newspapers every day he s more concerned with watching the bigger picture trends in 2013 acapulco started to see some improvement only to see the progress smashed and washed away as the city was hit by two hurricanes and then the fallout from the ayotzinapa scandal in september 2014 police and cartel hitmen colluded to kidnap kill and disappear the bodies of 43 student teachers from a notoriously militant and politically active teacher s college in the hills inland from the coast over the following weeks protesters sacked and burned the mayor s office in the town of iguala where the initial attack occurred the student activists and their supporters then marauded through the state capital and descended into acapulco where they attacked the airport smashed government buildings and set up roadblocks throughout the rest of 2014 protestors periodically barricaded the highway leading into acapulco and staged massive marches in acapulco mexico city and other metropolises throughout mexico although the movement never broadened into a well organized protest against violence and corruption in mexico it briefly became a rallying cry for ordinary citizens frustrated and exhausted by the daily reality of violent crime and impunity for criminals despite the gory incidents that happen almost every day melchor sees a lot of improvement things are much better than in the dark days of 2014 in 2014 there were times it went down in that year we got to the level of 18 percent in acapulco in the mirador it got to 2 percent there were days when i had just two rooms occupied i had to fire workers there was no work the few who stayed we couldn t pay them melchor says in the months after the tragedy in iguala many restaurant and hotel owners in acapulco took on a bitter and cynical attitude behind closed doors they started calling cocktails made with licor 43 ayotzinapos after the murdered students angry about the effects of the student activists highway blockades and violent protests were having on tourism one restaurateur who caters to the city s wealthy residents privately complained that instead of 43 students the narcos and their police allies should have disappeared 43 000 some residents say that when the army controlled guerrero with a heavy hand leftist political activists were brutally repressed and disappeared but criminals in acapulco also felt the overbearing military presence one bar owner after being forced to close after extortionists killed one of his waitresses said he missed the more peaceful days of his youth he told me he thinks that there were times when criminals were simply shackled with weights and dropped out of military helicopters into the ocean there are people in acapulco who believe that although the tactics were gross violations of due process and human rights they were also terrifyingly effective the strategy of flooding the streets with army trucks and police patrols by contrast hasn t yielded a tangible drop in violent crime today the informal street vendors in acapulco s business district and many of the city s taxi companies pay taxes to criminal groups the gangs have become a frightening sort of shadow state for the hospitality industry the security forces are a catch 22 without the heavily armed police and soldiers crime would probably increase but the presence of army units ready for war may also scare off many potential visitors photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram people who know the problems of acapulco see the police and feel safe but foreign tourists can see it and view it as a problem melchor explains he got his start after college working in the hospitality industry in the resort city of puerto vallarta but hasn t seen anything like the crisis engulfing acapulco before midway through march melchor still hasn t seen one group of spring breakers reserve hotel rooms photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram no not one years ago they came in the past it was a lot he says speaking slowly and remembering an easier era acapulco still hasn t fully recovered last year was a bad year not just for the mirador but all of acapulco melchor adds in 2014 the head of the city s tourist police disappeared his body was found a few days later in 2015 commander jimenez the founder of the community police in xaltianguis was found dead he was shot in the head while sitting in his car i met both men in 2013 they were both confident that the security situation in acapulco was starting to improve the violence in acapulco however continues to boil photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram although in the evenings american tourists from the luxury resorts on the outskirts of town come by el mirador to dine and watch the cliff divers as melchor and his team prepare for the rush of easter week tourism he doesn t have a single guest from the u s right now today let me see i don t think i have one he says foreign tourism still isn t recovering almost all of the tourism is national melchor says he estimates that 80 percent of the tourists who visit acapulco come from other parts of mexico the rise of mexican tourism is in some ways a positive trend tangible evidence of the emergence of a broad middle class in cities in the center of the country but the local tourists just stay for the weekend they don t replace the snowbirds from the u s who used to come and stay for months at a time it s been hardest with foreigners they want a safe place and with the security problems we ve had they don t trust acapulco melchor says he pauses briefly on a small landing and then labors up another steep flight of stairs he stops and looks over at the hotel s kiddie pool it s also empty likewise the carefully set tables at the hotel s patio restaurant also sit unoccupied many of the easter week tourists still haven t arrived and the hotel s small contingent of guests is still asleep saturday sunday it will be full for national tourism the weekend is the busiest melchor explains the restaurant is fitted with photos of celebrities who visited the hotel at different points over the last sixty years one photo shows rocky marciano standing with two local cliff divers today the restaurant relies on visitors who stay in hotels in other parts of the city but come to el mirador to watch the divers leap off the cliff outside into the cove below success depends on the flow of tourism in acapulco if acapulco s tourism is down if occupancy is down the clientele in the perla goes down he adds the restaurant has plastic laminated menus with an extensive set of expensive and unexceptional dishes the food isn t likely to appeal to the wealthy young professionals from mexico city who are accustomed to more refined fare but the menu s prices also put the restaurant above the budget for most local families el mirador is caught in a sort of no man s land photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram at the start of easter week 80 percent of acapulco s hotel rooms had been filled but the biggest influx came to the popular hotel towers that line the flat beaches in the zona dorada the more modern and expensive section of hotels just down the coast the area of acapulco tradicional where el mirador is located didn t feel the same boom at the start of the week almost half of the rooms in acapulco tradicional were still sitting empty el mirador has been able to fill more of its rooms than most of the other hotels in the district this year we re practically full it s national mexico city a group is coming tomorrow from mexico city melchor says with 133 rooms el mirador can hold up to 532 people but for most of the spring break season the bulk of el mirador s rooms sat empty melchor nods to a row of suites on the top of cliff these are from the 40s in that era most people who came to el mirador were foreigners there was little national tourism with mexicans it was just artists people from mexican cinema and politicians in the sixties it was high income people who came to acapulco even john f kennedy came to acapulco to celebrate his honeymoon in the 1960s el mirador was classified as one of the best hotels in the world melchor adds the movie blow shows johnny depp playing drug smuggling boston george jung celebrating his early criminal success at a seaside mansion in acapulco melchor looks up at the houses built higher up on the cliff in the seventies eighties they came to build houses it s wealthy people i don t know if they still come i just see caretakers if they come they just come for vacations they don t live in their houses he says melchor is confident that el mirador will recover he s working to remodel one section of large rooms and fit them with wi fi internet solar powered water heaters and other modern amenities like the older rooms the renovated section has big windows that look out at the cliffs and the sea with the piecemeal renovations melchor and his staff are doing what they can to try to rebuild the hotel s image abroad but faced with the broader crisis of violence there is only so much any individual hotel can do to bolster the tourism economy the acapulco of the past hasn t come back melchor says like other hoteliers he is waiting to see what the government can do to save the city the government has to work hard to gain people s trust back more than anything the foreign tourists he says we hope that tourists will regain their confidence if acapulco recovers the golden age of the sixties and seventies will come back he adds for now the tourists from nearby cities have kept the tourist economy from desiccating completely but it s still not enough having year round staff is still not possible you don t have occupancy for the whole week we can t sustain it we have a weekend staff three days friday saturday and sunday melchor explains photo by nathaniel parish flannery nathanielparish on instagram despite the challenges melchor retains hope that acapulco can bounce back the bay is beautiful the beaches are pretty there s a lot that could help acapulco re emerge again he says he thinks that with acapulco tradicional the government needs to do more to promote the history obviously the local state and federal authorities need to find a way to end the crime wave and bring peace to acapulco but aside from the security issue melchor still thinks that over time it will be possible to save acapulco tradicional if the hotels in the area work to re paint their facades and investors repair and renovate the buildings that have been abandoned the area can start a new chapter it s renovation but without losing the older aspects it has it s remodeling without losing the history he explains

related to the spin off the establishment of corepoint as a separate stand alone public company adjustments to income tax expense based on corepoint s post spin off reit tax structure and adjustments

measures are based on preliminary estimates accounting judgments and currently available information and assumptions that management believes are reasonable accordingly the unaudited pro forma financial data is not necessarily indicative of our financial position or results of operations had the transactions described above for which we are giving pro forma effect actually occurred on the dates indicated the tables below provide a reconciliation of the pro forma financial information for the company to the company s historical information a reconciliation of hotel adjusted ebitdare adjusted ebitdare ebitdare and ebitda to net income both on a pro forma and historical basis and a reconciliation of ffo and adjusted ffo to net income both on a pro forma and historical basis we believe this financial information provides meaningful supplemental information because it reflects the portion of the la quinta business that was conveyed to corepoint and the ongoing effects of the other spin off related transactions this represents how management views the business and reviews our operating performance it is also used by management when publicly providing the business outlook see the definitions of ebitda ebitdare adjusted ebitdare comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare ffo and adjusted ffo including pro forma adjusted amounts for a further explanation of the use of these measures ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure in many reit and non reit related industries the company believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance because it provides an indication of our ability to incur and service debt to satisfy general operating expenses and to make capital expenditures we calculate ebitda excluding discontinued operations ebitdare the company presents ebitdare in accordance with guidelines established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit nareit defines ebitdare as net income or loss excluding interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization gains or losses on the disposition of property impairments and adjustments to reflect the entity s share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates the company believes ebitdare is a useful performance measure to help investors evaluate and compare the results of the company s operations from period to period ebitdare is intended to be a supplemental non gaap financial measure that is independent of a company s capital structure adjusted ebitdare the company adjusts ebitdare when evaluating its performance because the company believes that the adjustment for certain items such as restructuring and separation transaction expenses acquisition and disposition transaction expenses stock based compensation expense discontinued operations and other items not indicative of ongoing operating performance provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our ongoing operating performance the company believes that ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare provide useful information to investors about it and its financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are among the measures used by the company s management to evaluate its operating performance and make day to day operating decisions and ii ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are frequently used by securities analysts investors lenders and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in and apart from the company s industry sector ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are not recognized terms under gaap have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing the company s results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are that these measures do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the company s working capital needs do not reflect the company s interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on its indebtedness do not reflect the company s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay its taxes do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments do not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that the company considers not to be indicative of our future operations including but not limited to discontinued operations impairment acquisition and disposition activities and restructuring expenses although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated amortized or impaired will often have to be replaced upgraded or repositioned in the future and ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and upgraded or repositioned in the future and ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in the company s industry may calculate ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare differently potentially limiting their usefulness as comparative measures because of these limitations ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare should not be considered as discretionary cash available to the company to reinvest in the growth of its business or as measures of cash that will be available to the company to meet its obligations comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare measures property level results at the company s comparable hotels before corporate level expenses and is a key measure of the hotel s profitability the company presents pro forma hotel adjusted ebitdare to help the company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the company s properties comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare margin represents the ratio of pro forma comparable hotel adjusted ebitdare to pro forma total revenues funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo we present nareit ffo attributable to stockholders and nareit ffo per diluted share defined as set forth below as non gaap measures of our performance we calculate funds from operations ffo attributable to stockholders for a given operating period in accordance with standards established by nareit as net income or loss attributable to stockholders calculated in accordance with gaap excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate gains or losses on sales of certain real estate assets impairment write downs of real estate assets discontinued operations income taxes related to sales of certain real estate assets and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles plus adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance we believe nareit ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits our presentation may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the terms in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during a given operating period we also present adjusted ffo attributable to stockholders and adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance and in our annual budget process we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo attributable to stockholders for the following items and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo attributable to stockholders transaction expense associated with the potential disposition of or acquisition of real estate or businesses severance expense share based compensation expense litigation gains and losses outside the ordinary course of business amortization of deferred financing costs reorganization costs and separation transaction expenses loss on extinguishment of debt straight line ground lease expense casualty losses deferred tax expense and other items that we believe are not representative of our current or future operating performance nareit ffo attributable to stockholders and adjusted ffo attributable to stockholders are not recognized terms under gaap have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under gaap nareit ffo is not an indication of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to fund dividends nareit ffo is also not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining nareit ffo investors are cautioned that we may not recover any impairment charges in the future accordingly nareit ffo should be reviewed in connection with gaap measurements we believe our presentation of nareit ffo is in accordance with the nareit definition however our nareit ffo may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other reits pro forma adjusted ebitdare non gaap reconciliation unaudited in millions three months ended december 31 2018 three

by total number of rooms sold in a given period adr measures the average room price attained by a hotel or group of hotels and adr trends provide useful information concerning pricing policies and the nature of the guest base of a hotel or group of hotels changes in room rates have an impact on overall revenues and profitability occupancy represents the total number of rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases revenue per available room revpar is defined as the product of the adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved revpar does not include other ancillary non room revenues such as food and beverage revenues or parking telephone or other guest service revenues generated by a hotel which are not significant for corepoint revpar changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental hotel operating profit than changes driven predominately by adr for example increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues as well as incremental operating costs including but not limited to housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs revpar increases due to higher adr however would generally not result in additional operating costs with the exception of those charged or incurred as a percentage of revenue such as credit card fees and commissions as a result changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in adr generally have a greater effect on operating profitability than changes in revpar driven by occupancy levels due to seasonality in our business we review revpar by comparing current periods to budget and period over period revpar index measures a hotel s fair market share of its competitive set s revenue per available room comparable hotels are defined as hotels that were active and operating in our portfolio for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the applicable reporting period and were active and operating as of january 1st of the previous year except for i hotels that sustained substantial property damage or other business interruption ii hotels that become subject to a purchase and sale agreement or iii hotels in which comparable results are otherwise not available management uses comparable hotels as the basis upon which to evaluate adr occupancy and revpar between periods for the set of comparable hotels existing at the reporting date versus the results of the same set of hotels in the prior period of the 315 hotels in our portfolio as of december 31 2018 304 have been classified as comparable hotels for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 one hotel located in panama city florida was removed from comparable results following substantial property damage sustained from hurricane michael in october 2018
today s highlights bank of england keeps on hold and uk retail sales slow australian employment strong new zealand gross domestic product growth picks up current market overview as from today we get more light than dark each day now that spring has sprung and i guess we are all hoping that heralds a similar transformation in our understanding of the brexit process more clarity and less opaqueness uk prime minister theresa may is quite right in saying that we have all had enough of the politics and now want a conclusion let s hope we can get that in the next eight days sterling slips a little on uncertainty maybe the markets are not convinced that is going to happen because sterling has dropped two cents against the euro and a little less against the us dollar we are expecting no change from the bank of england today on their 0 75 base rate but maybe some slowdown in retail sales especially at the core level sterling may slip a little further if that is true but no one should be surprised if people are holding on to their hard earned cash in such uncertain times australian jobs growth slower australian employment growth slowed a little in february just 4 600 fresh jobs were created but that brought the unemployment rate down to ac4 9 in an economy that is so geographically spread getting the right skills in the right locations is always challenging so this is pretty much full employment that would normally promote wage growth and that is inflationary hence the australian dollar strengthened a cent on the news and the reserve bank of australia has another factor pressing for an interest rate hike rather than any cuts nzd stronger in nearby new zealand economic growth picked up in q4 posting 0 6 growth against just 0 3 in q3 that puts interest rate cuts on the back burner for the reserve bank of new zealand and the kiwi dollar strengthened as you might expect and sticking with central banks the us federal reserve kept its base rate on hold last night and suggested there would be no rate hikes this year that weakened the us dollar a tad but even though this delay is due to slowing growth the delay in rate hikes will ultimately be good for the us economy we are in an odd position where the us yields are well above those in europe japan the uk and even australasia as if people needed another reason to hold us dollars spooky and you know how those antique experts on daytime tv talk about old furniture as having character and spirit well a thrift shop in salisbury north carolina recently sold a set of hand carved furniture with a different kind of spirit the lot came with a warning about the previous owners reporting the furniture was haunted it sold for 1 000 clearly someone wasn t concerned about having ghosts in their drawers spring has sprung sort of can february march no but april may when is trampolining season springtime naturally there are monkeys falling from the sky must be ape ril showers

gaap financial measures in addition to u s gaap financial measures this press release may refer to certain non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures are in addition to not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap these non gaap financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with the most comparable gaap financial measures definitions of non gaap financial measures reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below reporting definitions and explanations adjusted funds from operations affo affo is a non gaap financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the reit industry we adjust ffo to eliminate the impact of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance including restructuring and divestiture costs other general and administrative costs associated with relocation of the company s headquarters transactions costs associated with our spin off default interest and fees on non recourse mortgage indebtedness debt extinguishment gains losses transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments subject to existing leases amortization of the promote fee and certain non cash items these certain non cash items include non cash revenues comprised of straight line rents amortization of above and below market rent on our leases amortization of lease incentives amortization of net premium discount on loans receivable bad debt expense and amortization of capitalized lease transaction costs non cash interest expense comprised of amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of net debt discount premium and non cash compensation expense stock based compensation expense in addition other equity reits may not calculate affo as we do and accordingly our affo may not be comparable to such other equity reits affo affo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should only be considered a supplement and not an alternative to net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap as a performance measure adjusted ebitdare represents ebitdare adjusted for transaction costs real estate acquisition costs dispositions for the quarter as if such acquisitions and dispositions had occurred as of the beginning of the quarter revenue producing acquisitions impairments and loan losses related to the shopko loan debt extinguishment gains losses and amortization recovery of the promote fee we focus our business plans to enable us to sustain increasing shareholder value accordingly we believe that excluding these items which are not key drivers of our investment decisions and may cause short term fluctuations in net income loss provides a useful supplemental measure to investors and analysts in assessing the net earnings contribution of our real estate portfolio because these measures do not represent net income loss that is computed in accordance with gaap they should only be considered a supplement and not an alternative to net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap as a performance measure a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap to ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare is included in this release annualized adjusted ebitdare is calculated as adjusted ebitdare for the quarter adjusted for items where annualization would not be appropriate multiplied by four our computation of adjusted ebitdare and annualized adjusted ebitdare may differ from the methodology used by other equity reits to calculate these measures and therefore may not be comparable to such other reits a reconciliation of annualized adjusted ebitdare is included in this release adjusted debt represents interest bearing debt reported in accordance with gaap adjusted to exclude unamortized debt discount premium deferred financing costs and reduced by cash and cash equivalents and cash reserves on deposit with lenders as additional security by excluding these amounts the result provides an estimate of the contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid net of cash available to repay it we believe this calculation constitutes a beneficial supplemental non gaap financial disclosure to investors in understanding our financial condition a reconciliation of interest bearing debt reported in accordance with gaap to adjusted debt is included in this release adjusted debt to annualized adjusted ebitdare is a supplemental non gaap financial measure we use to evaluate the level of borrowed capital being used to increase the potential return of our real estate investments and a proxy for a measure we believe is used by many lenders and ratings agencies to evaluate our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time we believe this ratio is a beneficial disclosure to investors as a supplemental means of evaluating our ability to meet obligations senior to those of our equity holders our computation of this ratio may differ from the methodology used by other equity reits and therefore may not be comparable to such other reits cash available for distribution cad is defined as affo less capital expenditures and any other scheduled principal payments or receipts contractual rent represents monthly contractual cash rent excluding percentage rents from properties owned fee simple or ground leased recognized during the final month of the reporting period adjusted to exclude amounts received from properties sold during that period and adjusted to include a full month of contractual rent for properties acquired during that period we use contractual rent when calculating certain metrics that are useful to evaluate portfolio credit asset type industry and geographic diversity and to manage risk ebitdare is a non gaap financial measure and is computed in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit ebitdare is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expense plus income tax expense if any plus depreciation and amortization plus minus losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property plus impairment write downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures plus adjustments to reflect the company s share of ebitdare of unconsolidated real estate ventures economic yield is calculated by dividing the contractual cash rent including fixed rent escalations and or cash increases determined by cpi increases calculated using a month to month historical cpi index by the initial lease term expressed as a percentage of the gross investment funds from operations ffo we calculate ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit ffo represents net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization impairment charges and net gains losses from property dispositions ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure we use ffo as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that ffo is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance specifically in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization gains and losses from property dispositions and impairment charges which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance ffo provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other equity reits however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and does not capture the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited in addition other equity reits may not calculate ffo as we do and accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to such other equity reits ffo accordingly ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance gross investment represents the gross acquisition cost including the contracted purchase price and related capitalized transaction costs initial cash yield from properties is calculated by dividing the first twelve months of contractual cash rent excluding any future rent escalations provided subsequently in the lease and percentage rent by the gross investment in the related properties initial cash yield is a measure expressed as a percentage of the contractual cash rent expected to be earned on an acquired property in the first year because it excludes any future rent increases or additional rent that may be contractually provided for in the lease as well as any other income or fees that may be earned from lease modifications or asset dispositions initial cash yield does not represent the annualized investment rate of return of our acquired properties additionally actual contractual cash rent earned from the properties acquired may differ from the initial cash yield based on other factors including difficulties collecting anticipated rental revenues and unanticipated expenses at these properties that we cannot pass on to tenants liquidity reserve represents cash held on deposit until there is a cashflow shortfall as defined in the master trust 2014 agreements or a liquidation of master trust 2014 occurs master trust 2014 is an asset backed securitization trust established in 2005 and amended and restated in 2014 which issues non recourse notes collateralized by commercial real estate net leases and mortgage loans from time to time indirect special purpose entity subsidiaries of the company are the borrowers this liability is discussed in greater detail in our financial statements and the notes thereto included in our periodic reports filed with the sec occupancy is calculated by dividing the number of economically yielding owned properties in the portfolio as of the measurement date by the number of total owned properties on said date other properties are all properties not included in the master trust 2014 owned properties refers to properties owned fee simple or ground leased by company subsidiaries as lessee real estate investment represents the gross investment plus improvements less impairment charges smta preferred stock refers to the 10 series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock weighted average remaining lease term is calculated by dividing the sum product of a a stated revenue or sales price component and b the lease term for each lease by c the sum of the total revenue or sales price components for all leases within the sample workout assets include tenants or properties that are targeted for potential

bullard gordin grouse kane berman majozi rw johnson straight talk singapore revisited wsm documents cyril ramaphosa s reply to sona 2019 debate full transcript includes president s response to lekota

assembled in the chamber of the national assembly at 14 07 the speaker of the national assembly and the chairperson of the national council of provinces took the chair the speaker of the national assembly requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayers or meditation the president of the republic start of day reply by the president to debate on the state of the nation address the president of the republic speaker of the national assembly ms baleka mbete chairperson of the national council of provinces ms thandi modise deputy president of the republic in absentia because his child is ill and has just had an operation we wish his family well in the difficult time they are going through ministers deputy ministers premiers mecs and councillors of our local government hon members and our guests up in the gallery yes indeed and the official opposition allow me to wish my wife who is in the gallery and all the women members of our parliament here present a happy valentine s day seeing as my reply to the state of the nation address debate takes place on valentine s day madam speaker i decided to bring some roses to parliament to hand a rose to my wife and to the women members of our parliament as well as the hard working women who work for our government and our parliament and who provide a wonderful service so all of them will be receiving valentine s roses from me their president hon steenhuisen i am sorry you won t be getting a rose or a candle from me to the women of south africa may your valentine s day be crowned with love and happiness may it be filled with care respect and mutual recognition let me begin by extending my sincere gratitude to all hon members who participated in the debate over the last two days for engaging with the state of the nation address in many ways this debate was a demonstration that although we may differ on many issues and often differ very loudly we share a common desire for a better south africa unfortunately for many it was also a lost opportunity this debate always provides parties with a platform to engage meaningfully and sincerely with the state of the nation address and to outline their vision and explain their policies to improve the lives of south africans it is also an opportunity for opposition parties to offer solutions and advice i was waiting for pearls of wisdom from our fellow members of parliament but very few came instead of engaging seriously with the matters of national importance that were raised in the state of the nation address several speakers used this platform for personal attacks for vitriol and for pontification now i was advised that i should perhaps not even dignify some of the comments that were made with any form of response particularly what the hon lekota had to say against that advice i have decided rather to set the record straight the hon lekota is correct in saying we were detained in the same trial event in 1974 i was then 21 and a couple of months old i was a student at the university of the north and had then been elected the chairman as we used to call it in those days of the sa students organisation saso branch steve biko barney pityana harry nengwekhulu and many others were the gigantic leaders of saso at the time we got involved through a call that had been made to organise pro frelimo rallies the president of the students representative council src sedibe got deeply immersed in this as did a number of us following the pro frelimo rallies that we held the then government decided to conduct a swoop on all of us my arrest was quite dramatic because sedibe the president of the src had been arrested and we decided to march on the mankweng police station which the hon malema will be most familiar with we marched on that police station as a student body and during that march the src went in while some of us stayed outside they then decided that they wanted to have me arrested they then said to call ramaphosa in because he could shed light on matters the src members without knowing that this was going to happen called me in as soon as i sat down they were told they could all leave as ramaphosa was now under arrest i was arrested and transported to pretoria central prison where i was in solitary confinement for a solid six months before anyone came to talk to me at the time my father was a policeman he was a police sergeant and through his efforts i finally got to see him he explained to me that they said they had a lot of things against me and asked me what i had done i explained to him and he said my son i understand later they started interrogating me it was quite vicious i will not go into that however the issue that they really wanted from me was to give evidence against accused number 1 saths cooper accused number 2 muntu myeza accused number 3 terror lekota and a number of others i refused and they thought they would use my dad to put pressure on me to agree to become a state witness i refused i said i would not do it then i was taken i was taken to the silverton police station and when i got there my neighbour in the adjacent cell was another detainee whose name i am not going to disclose because something horrible happened to him they had been working on him to also become a state witness he leant against the wall talking through it and told me that he had finally agreed to become a state witness i then realised why i had been taken to silverton my dad came to visit me and he said they wanted me to be a state witness i said dad i am not going to do it i will never betray the comrades that i was working with and if i did where would i go and live thereafter i refused now after i refused my neighbour then went and gave evidence he gave evidence against terror lekota and all of them as i persisted in my refusal to give evidence they let me go but they brought me back they said they still wanted me to give evidence and i persisted in refusing he gave evidence the trial went on it ended and they were sentenced and then i was released now you know when you deal with the police with the security police there are three things they want from you you co operate with them by giving evidence against your comrades or you become an askari and go and kill your comrades or you become a paid agent i did not do any of the three things that they wanted not at all not at all when they released me for the last time they then said they wanted me to work with them i still remember who it was it was maj heystek he said we want you to work with us and i said i will never agree to work with you and betray my people and they said we will come back to you c w the uprising in 1976 after my spell of detention robyn 15 02 19 at 10h35 take ends at 14 35 take 53a take starts at 14 18 07 the president of the republic contd c w and they said we will come back to you the uprising in 1976 after my spell of detention i then joined the black people s convention bps because the university would not take me back so i joined the bps which was a black consciousness oriented organisation like the south african students organisation saso and we continued with the struggle the year 1976 happened and on the very day that the uprising happened at 3 00 a knock at my father s home sounded on the door and interestingly there was a comrade of mine who was later killed by the venda police and his name was tshifhiwa muofhe we were friends at high school and he had come to visit me on the 16th they found him sleeping with me in the dining room they arrested both of us and he looked so much like tsietsi mashinini they immediately said that they have tsietsi mashinini who was leading the uprising they took me to john vorster square where i was for another six months interestingly terror lekota when i got into the cell i told myself i am now here for five years because earlier they had been threatening me with a five year and ten year jail sentence i persisted in refusing to give evidence they said you are going to be like nelson mandela you are going to break rocks on robben island i said in the end i would rather go and break rocks but i will never ever betray my people my father supported me in all this notwithstanding the fact that he was a police sergeant in the south african police service at the time he supported me after i was detained in 1976 i was finally released without any charge being preferred against me tshifhiwa muofhe was later released because they found that tshifhiwa muofhe was not tsietsi mashinini in the end he was detained again and killed by the venda police following that my journey led me to the unions where i organised workers i want to take time to explain the organisation of the national union of mineworkers num to hon malema because that is another issue that has been raised in the past the question has always been that the num was an anglo american project that is what has always been raised that story started being spread by some within our own ranks who have at the time been given the responsibility to organise mineworkers their approach had not worked and they then started spreading a story as they saw the num growing how did we organise the num james motlatsi elijah barayi and a number of others paul nkuna bear testimony to this we went into the mines started trying to organise and mineworkers would not join the union they said you are insurance agents and why should we join the union the question they kept on asking hon malema was have you got permission from management to come and organise us we said no they said we don t want to get fired so we are not going to join your union and in any event we think it is an insurance company they kept asking me where do you come from i would say i come from soweto they said you are a skelm from soweto and we are not going to join this thing of you our initial plans to organise mineworkers were failing as we saw that they were failing we decided that we should rather go into the fortress where they are accommodated and not organise them in the street in the corners in the towns and in buses those days mineworkers were accommodated in fortresses which were impregnable and you could not go in we decided to go to the chamber of mines and we said the wiehahn commission has now declared that black mineworkers can join unions and we want them to join unions so give us access because we need access to organise them access had been given to a number of other unions in the factories offices had been opened in factory environments and what have you so we said like it is happening in factories we want access to the mine hostels previous to that the attempts to organise mineworkers hon malema had been to try and get them in buses as they were going home in the rural areas but they had all failed so we decided that we will take another direction and we did we got access and we started organising mineworkers they kept asking do you have permission we said yes at the time anglo american and rand mines were the only two mining houses that had allowed their workers to join unions naturally the unions started growing it grew by leaps and bounds i have often said to those people who said that we were an anglo american project why would anglo american act against its own interests it was anglo american that was most severely affected by the strikes that mineworkers embarked upon in 1987 they bore the biggest brunt of the strike at the time so the union grew and not only did it grow the num was the first union to adopt the freedom charter in our country the very first union and following that the num was the biggest motivator for the formation of cosatu and it was the biggest union in cosatu hon lekota and hon malema you raised these issues and throw around innuendos you must realise how dangerous this is like dr motsoaledi said yesterday the same accusation was made against nelson mandela when he was still in prison many people said that nelson mandela was selling out because he had agreed to be separated from his comrades and was therefore in pollsmoor alone being manipulated and was selling out that is the story that was peddled around but when i met walter sisulu a wise leading comrade of our movement i asked him about this how did you as the eldest of our movement handled this they said we were never concerned about this we looked at the character of the leader nelson mandela that is what we looked at and having examined his character and having seen the commitment that he had made to the freedom of our people we were least concerned about all that now comrades and members on the other side these accusations of people selling out have also led to the deaths of people as dr aaron motsoaledi said in this very parliament now hon malema you visited london a few years ago and said that nelson mandela was a sell out and then there were reports and those reports keep coming i was not even intending to raise it here but i do so because we do need to deal with this issue because it is cancerous the report that came out was that the eff is an mi6 project i rejected that i rejected that because i knew we were dealing with people of good character and that you would never go to that extent they keep coming with the position that one holds now you keep getting all these innuendos these accusations and suggestions in the end you need to deal with the character of the person i have rejected those types of statements hon malema because i look at you and i look at your character and your commitment to the people of south africa from the platform that you now occupy it was o r tambo who warned us beware of the wedge driver watch his poisonous snake these stories that are spread about people doing that and that are so dangerous nelson mandela had to deal with this issue when he became president of the anc and he said i keep getting all these reports i was his secretary general and he once said i get all these reports and if i were to examine them all more than half of the members of my nec would be regarded as spies and it would divide the african national congress you remember that he added that it would even lead to people getting killed let us be aware of wedge drivers let us be aware of people who want to spread poisonous messages amongst us i can testify that i have never ever been a spy and i have never worked with the enemy all i have ever done in my life is to have a commitment to the people of our country that is all that i have never done thank you the speaker thank you hon members we will come to the end i am sure you will have more time at that point the president of the republic mr m c ramaphosa hon speaker we sit here as representatives of the people of our country now let me deal with that you say that you want us to establish a judicial commission i have no interest as president of this country to appoint judicial commissions that will waste taxpayers many for nothing that i will not do the ordinary people of our country know that there is no truth in this now we sit here as duly elected members of our parliament to advance the interest of those people who have elected us c w we all of us have a responsibility src take ends at 14 35 take 54 starts at 14 35 now we sit here as duly elected members of our parliament the president of the republic we all of us have a responsibility particularly in the months that remain in the term of this parliament and this administration to do everything within our means to fulfil the mandate given to us while many hon members correctly described the many achievements of the past 25 years of democracy and quantified many of the achievements of this administration they also drew attention to the great difficulties that still confront many of our people and that is a reality that we will not run away from we still confront huge challenges and difficulties which are borne on the shoulders of the ordinary poor people in our country on both sides of the house members spoke about the conditions of poverty and hardships that many of our people still live under although we have raised millions of people out of absolute poverty although we have built well over three million houses provided water and electricity there are still more than two million families that live in informal settlements and nearly a third of children under the ages of 5 years are stunted due to severe and long term malnutrition that they experience we have created more than seven million additional jobs since the advent of democracy we however concede that this has not kept pace with the number of people entering the job market as we create jobs more young people are coming onto the job market and that is a challenge that we should face collectively as a country what this debate has made plain is that while we have made a remarkable progress we need to do much more furthermore this debate has made it abundantly clear that we cannot continue at this rate that is why we are working hard across a number of fronts to change the pace and trajectory of our development so that we can build on the many achievements of the last quarter century this is why we are working every day to accelerate economic growth and make meaningful progress in finding work for the 9 7 million south africans who are unemployed we applaud the great initiatives that several of our provinces and many municipalities are undertaking to stimulate economic growth and create jobs this includes the work being done by kwazulu natal to support small medium enterprises for young people and the work being done in gauteng through programmes like tshepo 1 million in providing pathways for young people into the economy of our country what is clear from many of the statements in this house from the comments from business leaders unions community organisations and from the views also expressed by ordinary south africans is that there is a shared determination to move our country forward this is where south africans are currently they want this country to move forward and not backwards they don t want their country to be stark in a rut therefore they are looking for solutions and proposals that are going to propel our country forward there is a shared determination to ensure that we do whatever necessary to keep moving forward there is a shared determination to confront every challenge no matter how intractable to take bold decisions no matter how difficult this year we will commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle of grahamstown where xhosa forces under the leadership of makhanda took on the might of the british invasion force we also commemorate the battle of lsandlwana which took place 140 years ago where the soldiers of king cetshwayo inflicted a crushing defeat on the mighty british empire these were acts of courage and acts of resistance that will forever be remembered in the history of the struggle of our people these battles must serve as an inspiration as once again we must confront enormous challenges this time as a united nation and not as a divided nation the challenges we face are many complex and substantial and we will require a collective and concerted effort to overcome them if ever there was a time when south africans need to work together this is the time the programme we outlined in the state of the nation address has at its core the needs and interests of the poor people of our country it is about creating work and business opportunities in the townships and the rural areas where the poorest people of our country live we spoke last week about the industrial parks in townships and rural areas that are being revitalised as part of the efforts to turn these into areas of economic activity this programme is about the reliable supply of water and sanitation to villages of our country it is about the 2 6 million households that benefit from the indigent support system for water and those households that also benefit from the indigent system for electricity the programmes we outlined in state of the nation address is about teaching young people from the most deprived areas of our country to read at a level comparable not only to their compatriots but also to their peers across the world we applaud the work being done by the department of basic education to prioritise access to quality education we have seen how the education outcomes have been improving over the years the matric results of last year were a clear testimony that things are changing and that we are moving forward without any fail we applaud the principals and teachers across the country that daily make it their responsibility to create a better future for our children we disagree fundamentally with those who say that teachers are a problem they are not a problem they are a solution to the education challenges that we face they are indeed we must pay tribute to them empower them and equip them to be able to do their work even a lot better our programme is also about protecting communities from gangsters it is about the work being done by the police together with other departments and agencies to establish anti gang units that tackle such crimes with all the means available to the state our programme is about providing the social support that the most vulnerable in our society need to survive it is the successive governments of the anc that have increased the number of social grants to around 17 5 million today we welcome the work that is being done by the department of social development in revamping the social grant payment system and the role that the post office is playing as a state owned entity in ensuring effective delivery of the social grants that our people are paid from special economic zones to the black industrialists programme and from investor road shows to the buy local campaign all our efforts are measured by the impact they have on those in society who have the least our programmes must be measured first and foremost by the impact that they also have on our children though they constitute a third of our population though they hold within their hands the future of our nation the voice of our children is seldom heard they cannot vote they do not set policy and are therefore too easily ignored yet their interests must be placed at the forefront of our policies as the hon dlamini zuma noted we are putting our children first this means that we are focusing on a far more co ordinated way on the first 1 000 days in every child s life this is the time when the investment we make in adequate health care positive socialisation good nutrition quality child care a clean and safe environment and structured early learning will have a profound impact on their chances in life we welcome the statement by the hon godi that the apc stands ready to contribute to the implementation of early childhood development we thank you for that our programmes to improve maternal and child health to make access to early childhood development universal to provide grants and nutrition support to the very poor are as important to the economic future of our economy as anything we do in the area of investment trade and skills development we are just as interested in the progress we are making in reducing infant mortality and malnutrition amongst five year olds as we are with the rate of gdp growth or levels of fixed investment we seek not to separate these we want to focus on all of them these are the indicators for us that matter we know that we must do more and indeed we are doing more to keep our children safe to protect them from abuse and violence this means strengthening our approach to community policing to make the places where children live safe and intensifying the work already underway to make our police prosecutors and courts more responsive to the needs of children the needs of south africa s children now and into the future informs our efforts to build an education system capable of bringing out the best in our learners we must continue to prioritise our early reading comprehension programmes not only in schools but across society the minister of basic education is always harping on how as south africans we have a very weak and low reading culture she is always comparing us for instance with the russians who have possibly the highest reading culture in the world her wish is that south africans must live up to a much higher reading culture we will soon be launching a project that draws on the vast network of reading initiatives and resources we have in this country to turn south africa into a reading nation as we noted in the state of the nation address we have a responsibility as a nation to ensure that all south africans are able equally and without exception to enjoy their inalienable rights to life dignity and liberty we know and concede that with respect to the rights of people with disabilities we have not achieved nearly as enough we have made massive strides from the welfare approach before 1994 to an approach that seeks to enable all people with disabilities to access opportunities and achieve their potential we have put in place policies that give effect to the provisions of our constitution and that are aligned to un conventions and continental plans of action but as the hon bhengu kombe reminded us in clear and certain terms we are still falling behind in implementation it is for this reason that we are insisting that the next medium term strategic framework mtsf for 2020 25 should mainstream disability across all government departments and programmes in the end this should be accompanied by an integrated information system that is able to track performance against targets every state organ should be reporting substantively on the inclusion of people with disability within their respective mandates we are working with renewed energy and commitment to ensure that people with disabilities are a part of a cohesive society we are working to ensure that they have equitable access to education health services employment social security and all the opportunities that come with living in a democracy next week i will be chairing the presidential working group on persons with disability to engage on these and other issues this is really a valuable opportunity for the dialogue between government and a section of society that for too long has not been able to fully realise the promise of our constitution if we are a country that prioritises the interests of the poor and the vulnerable then we need to act with greater urgency to respond to the effects of climate change and make our contribution in preventing it the rural poor are most affected by climate change ravages the droughts that have become more frequent and last longer affect them much more than people who live in cities the urban poor are most affected by the impact this has on food prices and the availability of water and this mother city experienced precisely that just two years ago it is people who live in informal settlements who are most affected by the flooding that accompanies the increasing extreme weather conditions we are all affected in different ways by the environmental challenges and changes that are taking place on land in our oceans and in the air it is time that we too as south africans must take climate change much more serious in talking to the secretary general of the united nations in addis ababa this past few days i asked him what is the biggest issue on his agenda and he said climate change is by far the biggest issue on his agenda as secretary general of the globe unless we tackle climate change we will not be able to meet our developmental objectives we have ratified the paris agreement to combat climate change as part of the global effort to dramatically reduce the rate of global warming as part of our efforts to build a sustainable low carbon economy we are taking steps to finalise the national climate change bill which will provide a regulatory framework for the management of climate change and its impact we are making a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise green house gases through our nationally determined contribution to the un framework convention on climate change south africa is due to be the next co ordinator of the committee of african heads of state and government on climate change which is vital in ensuring that africa remains united but also speak with one voice on the key climate change issues facing the continent the progress we have made in responding to the various environmental challenges that confront our people is in no small measure thanks to the leadership and dedication of the late minister of environmental affairs ms edna molewa the late minister edna molewa worked ceaselessly to ensure that the conservation of the environment became a catalyst to advance the objectives of the national development plan ndp taking our lead from her vision we continue to encourage investment in cleaner energy through the renewable energy independent power producers programme through the competitive bidding process south africa has benefited from rapid global technology developments and price trends buying clean energy at lower and lower rates with every bid cycle as a result south africa is now getting renewable energy at some of the lowest tariffs in the world under the renewable energy a total number of 112 projects have been procured and it is envisaged that these projects will create 114 000 job years over the construction and 20 year operations period a job year is equivalent to a full time employment opportunity for one person per year we will work with all stakeholders to ensure that our gradual transition towards new forms of electricity generation taking into account yes our base fossil fuels that all these creates jobs develops new capabilities and does not negatively affect the livelihoods of communities where energy is generated if there is to be an impact there should be a just transition process so that we the secure jobs we skill our people reskill and also upskill them so that as technology changes they also move with the technological developments that are bound to take place on the 8th of march we will be launching a landmark campaign to mobilise all south africans to become environmentally conscious the good green deeds programme is aimed at changing behaviour towards things such as littering where as south africans we just scatter and throw litter all over wherever we walk wherever we live and whatever we do it will also be aimed at addressing illegal dumping that takes place throughout our country it will also be aimed at making sure that we manage our waste in a responsible manner these we will wage it is part of our call and our commitment to clean south africa to make our cities towns and rural areas safer places and healthy to live to work and to have leisure this is something that we would like to undertake on 8th march on a whole scale basis where every south african is able to pick up a broom a bag and make sure that we clean up south africa and make it clean because of environmentally insensitive human action the forces of nature conspired to set in motion the dramatic process of climate change it is by conscious human action that its effects can and will be mitigated and ultimately reversed public employment programmes have contributed a great deal to enable us to address the challenges of unemployment that many of our people face much as they do not provide permanent work they have provided meaningful work opportunities through the expanded public works programme epwp the epwp provides income relief and skills training to young unemployed south africans it also does so to a number of adults as well to our communities across a range of sectors they are carrying out socially useful activities such as road maintenance construction and this i saw it myself in the eastern cape and kwazulu natal where a number of women allocate to each other half a kilometre maintain and close up potholes phenomenal work is being done in kwazulu natal 40 000 women are involved in this it is the most meaningful work that all of us as south africans should applaud on an ongoing basis they also get involved in land and water use management waste management and community crime prevention it is with a great sense of pride that we were recently able to witness the teams of the epwp funded programme on working on fire battling the fires across the cape mountain range these young men and women were exemplary in both their professionalism and the manner in which they were a reassuring presence to the afflicted communities the success of working on fire shows just what a positive impact the epwp has had not only on job creation but also on mobilising young people and teaching them useful skills since the start of the fifth administration this programme has led to the creation of 3 2 million work opportunities at a total of 225 sites across nine provinces that has been increasing over the years the programme places an emphasis on skills training to enable participants to find full time work once they exit the programme in the past financial year 170 participants were trained as artisans and have qualified as auto electricians boilermakers diesel mechanics fitters and turners and motor mechanics phase 3 of this programme will be completed in march this year and phase 4 will begin in april phase 4 will target the creation of five million work opportunities a collective and concerted effort by all south africans to address our challenges means that no person group or stakeholder should be left out there is a need to intensify consultation and engagement across society the views of all stakeholders must be heard and they must also be count they must also know that they count for something some have been dismissive of the summits that we have convened over the past 12 months but these summits hon members have without exception provided platforms for the various people in our country the social partners to identify problems and develop solutions they have without exception charted a way forward and established a firm foundation for collective action summits by themselves yes are not enough following these summits we have embarked on action action that is being monitored and being measured and also being reported i will soon be convening presidential working groups on labour so that we can engage at a deep level with labour business the youth and the social sector respectively these provide an opportunity for structured engagement with these key sectors of society to address issues that are of concern to them and to broader society the unprecedented failure of eskom s generating capacity over the last few days underlines the severity of the challenges the company faces and the urgency of measures that are needed to address them for those who have doubted the extent of these challenges this week s load shedding has provided a hugely damaging reality check there is a no single solution to the problems at eskom there just is no one silver bullet neither restructuring nor refinancing nor cost cutting nor tariff increases nor better plant maintenance on their own will have the necessary effect we need to pursue all of these measures and more simultaneously in a co ordinated fashion and with purpose to turn the utility around and we will turn it around the decision we announced in the state of the nation to establish three separate state owned entities and let me be clear three separate 100 percent owned state entities for generation transmission and distribution respectively has received the most attention but it is by no means the only or most significant measure that must be undertaken in his budget speech next week the minister of finance will detail the measures that government will undertake to assist eskom to stabilise its finances it has become clear that indeed eskom does need to be assisted by the state so that it can stabilise its finances because doing so also means that we are stabilising the economy of our country it represents a significant commitment at a time when public finances are severely constrained it must therefore be accompanied by and must be dependent on a credible far reaching turnaround plan that has both an immediate and a lasting impact the leadership of the entity itself has already taken steps to cut costs and improve efficiency but much more needs to be done and it needs to be done much more quickly one of the tasks that are essential to ensuring secure electricity supply is a dedicated and detailed focus on maintenance maintenance doesn t grab headlines nor does it strike most people as even vaguely interesting but an effective comprehensive maintenance programme properly funded and led by skilled personnel is the one thing that stands between reliable electricity supply and darkness we welcome the measures being undertaken to urgently strengthen this capability the fundamental principle that must underpin our response to the eskom crisis is that yes it must be inclusive and consultative we accept as government that we have not done enough to bring some of the key stakeholders such as labour on board on the various aspects of this matter but we are determined to correct this as social partners as stakeholders as a country we have a common interest in finding sustainable solutions to the crisis at eskom i have been talking to labour and have informed them that we are going to have a rather deep conversation with them about eskom and this is going to be in the next few days i say this because we have a collective responsibility some sit on the sidelines and criticise we are in the ring and we are in the arena doing the work while others pontificate and sit on the side none of us can abdicate our responsibility nor can anyone should be left out of this process where we disagree we must engage let us put the facts on the table let us examine the evidence and let us together find workable solutions rather than pontificate i invite all of us and all the key stakeholders to never give up on finding a solution and we should never give up on each other as well let us reject the false narrative that the only way out of this is through bitter confrontation and conflict and through shouting and screaming from our seats our challenges will be not be resolved in the streets but will rather be resolved around the table as government we understand the fears of workers about job losses at eskom as well as in associated industries i have a keen understanding of this we also understand the concerns of lenders investors and business owners we will also address them in as direct a manner as possible the next weeks and months yes are going to be difficult moments for us as we effect the changes that need to be made it is our responsibility to ensure that through this process we take the greatest care to minimise the negative impact on the most vulnerable in our society the township of our country the rural areas the worker the emerging farmer the small business owners and employers of our people in tackling this urgent and serious matter let us be cautious of reckless claims and political posturing there are sound valid and compelling reasons to effect the change we are talking about it is about looking at the business model of eskom and see what will work best it is not a path to privatisation i repeat it is not a path to privatisation restructuring will reduce the risk of a massive eskom that at times has in its current form been termed too big to fail placing government in a position where all our eggs are in one basket now the break down of six units immediately takes out 4000 megawatts and has an overarching impact not only on the economy of our country but on the lives of our people as well this happens because we have all our eggs in one basket the restructuring will align eskom with international electricity trends where the vertically integrated electricity utilities have been broken up to enable better regulatory oversight through a single buyer model increase competition and making sure that the risks are minimised as a good example this has been in a number of countries and even on our own continent a unitary eskom has proven to be difficult to lead looked at just ordinarily it is by any means the largest enterprise in our country it has gone through a number of board and executive leadership iterations without trending towards a sustainable operational path ultimately this process is intended to ensure security of electricity of supply for the country which is critical to building up the positive investor sentiment and confidence essential for the investment required so sorely so that we can create jobs in the end eskom in its current form faces a number of challenges in the end we also need to look at the financing of eskom financially the reference to cost cutting should be understood not to mean retrenchments the preferred strategy in reducing human resources costs in the end is not what would ordinarily be the preferred route we further need to look at the benefits that this whole process will yield for us as we restructure eskom operationally eskom s plant age is an average of 37 years and has seen some of the engineers that have been trained to maintain these legacy systems exit the business and those are some of the challenges that we face in eskom some of these experienced technical professionals have been traced to other parts of the world and responding to the thuma mina call they have indicated that they want to come back home to assist us to show up eskom in the mean time what we need to do as you scream and shout is to aggressively put the load shedding behind us the teams assembled by the presidency minister of public enterprises and the eskom board need to prioritise the building up of adequate electricity generation safety margin to ensure the national grid is restored to the state of robustness able of withstand the demands that will be placed on it by new industrial capacity we all need to agree on the roadmap with concrete actions in the short immediate and long term to achieve an end state of an electricity secure country while restructuring eskom won t solve the immediate electricity supply crisis it will position the company to more effectively meet the country s energy needs into the future it will also help us in simplifying management but more importantly it will also enable funders to better assess the risk and opportunity and open space for new investment in the generation capacity on an urgent basis i have constituted a special cabinet committee on eskom which will be led by the deputy president consisting of the minister of public enterprises energy finance transport state security agency ssa and the police to be seized with the matter of eskom on a daily basis and to provide me with reports daily on what actions need to be taken to secure energy supply hon members we are going to embark on these steps i would like to say to south africans that we approach this with the seriousness that it deserves and take all the necessary actions to ensure that south africa is energy secure that we deal with the challenges that eskom is going through right now and in the end ensure that it does not do any damage to our economy we are at a moment in our history where we need to make difficult choices public finances are constrained and we will hear this more clearly when minister tito mboweni delivers his budget speech next week our capacity to borrow is extremely limited it is therefore necessary for us to prioritise and to make trade offs we need at this time to direct our resources to those programmes that have the greatest impact on poverty alleviation job creation and economic growth we need as several hon members have said to trim the fat to reduce expenditure that is not essential to realise our priorities to cut down on wastage and uncontrolled spending simply put we need to be efficient in our use of financial resources we are determined and committed to getting value for our money through better systems improved productivity and consequences for non performance the public audit amendment act significantly empowers the auditor general to act more directly against those who squander and misappropriate public funds we have already started work to ensure that the outcomes of investigations by the special investigating unit siu are more rigorously and speedily acted upon in the end i wish to make it quite clear for those who as i dealt with the issue of national prosecuting agency said the scorpions are back the scorpions are not back we are setting up as allowed by the national prosecuting act special investigating unit in the prosecuting directorate these are going to be focused on specific areas that need proper investigations that will lead to prosecution without fail and on an immediate basis those who have benefited from the injustices of the past have a crucial role to play in ensuring they are redressed those who have had the opportunity to accumulate assets gain skills and acquire or inherit networks have both a responsibility and a vested interest in using these capabilities to improve the lives of our people companies that hold cash reserves have a powerful incentive and an increasingly beneficial environment to invest in productive activity and activity that creates jobs and thereby expanding local demand and promotes social stability we have a system of taxation that is premised on the principle of social solidarity those who earn more should contribute proportionately more to the public purse as is evident over the last year we are committed to strengthen this critical instrument for redistribution and are taking firm measures to reduce the potential for abuse either through corruption or tax evasion the national health insurance nhi is an important area where social solidarity can be most effective because of the dual nature of health care provision in south africa with huge disparities between private and public expenditure and huge differences in health access there is a strong social as well as an economic argument for a more equitable distribution of health spending it is for this reason that we have consulted widely with all relevant stakeholders and we are now on track to finalise the national health insurance bill for submission to parliament it is premised on the morally compelling belief that access or lack thereof to quality health care service must not be determined by ones socioeconomic status once fully implemented the nhi will bring to life the spirit of human solidarity where through the principle of cross subsidisation the young subsidise the old the healthy subsidise the sick and the rich subsidise the poor given the urgency with which we must attend to the challenges in our health care system we convened the first presidential health summit in october last year and brought together key stakeholders from a wide range of constituencies in the sector we emerged from the summit with very sound immediate short term and long term solutions to improve the effectiveness of the health system we had the opportunity two days ago to launch the report of the summit which contains and elaborates on the solutions we want to take the report also provides more information on the practical steps we are taking to deal with amongst other things the health of our workforce supply chain management medical products equipment and machinery and infrastructure planning solidarity needs to extend beyond our borders as well those who have been freed from the chains of oppression and those who live in conditions of liberty and democracy have a responsibility to those who struggle against occupation discrimination and repression our support for the struggle of the palestinian people is not merely a product of history it is a refusal to accept that a people should be continually denied the right of self determination in violation of international law next month we will be hosting a sadc solidarity conference in support of the struggle of the saharawi people against the colonial occupation of their territory we do so because we believe in the inalienable rights of all people to freedom and dignity and because we are convinced that unless all people are freed from the chains of oppression the world will never know peace stability or inclusive prosperity this is the last debate on the state of the nation address in terms of the fifth democratic parliament i was heartened to hear a number of members saying mr president after the elections we want you to have so many departments in government and to appoint this type of minister and so forth thus acknowledging that the anc is coming back as the leader of government once again so i thank you for those accolades i thank you because you are already mapping out our task as we will return in the next administration i think mr maimane your seat is now going to be right at the back when we come back in just under three months from now all of us will exercise the cherished right to vote that we won 25 years ago we should expect that parties will campaign vigorously and loudly as in any healthy democracy we should expect a fierce contestation between parties between different perspectives and divergent presentations of reality however no matter how robust the campaigning we need to avoid utterances or actions that divide south africans as political parties and as leaders we must desist thank you for agreeing mr maimane from statements that demean or insult or offend other races other languages other religions or other groups i totally agree with the hon buthelezi when he says that never before have we seen such a deluge of racial slurs and divisive talk from leaders in our nation we share a responsibility to unite the country no matter how much and how enthusiastically we disagree ahead of the election we equally share a responsibility to accept the popular mandate of the people of south african we equally share a responsibility to work together to build a south africa that belongs to all who live in it in those difficult and trying times we share a responsibility to work together for the people of this country for ordinary families who struggle to make ends meet and to come up with ways to stretch their rands just that little bit further for homes for school fees and to put food on the table for the men and women who perform the services that keeps this country going our teachers our police our nurses and our doctors who get up every morning to go and do their work we share a responsibility to support them in the work that they do for the young men and women of this country who have not yet found employment but who still go out their cvs in hand knocking on doors making calls and sending emails for the students who have to take on extra jobs to finance their studies and return home late and exhausted but remain committed to finishing their education it is upon these people that the future of this country really in the end depends to them the people of south africa we say it is your hopes and your expectations that we carry with us we have felt your frustration and we have heeded your calls for real change we are determined to rectify the mistakes of the past improve the conditions of the present and to work with you side by side to make this our south africa a land of prosperity for all a land in which the noble values of our constitution and our bill of rights are the canvas upon which we chart a new and glorious future not just for ourselves but for those yet to come i can say to all those south africans who so depend on us who are seated here we will try everything we can not fail you hon members we gather here as the representatives of the people of this country duly elected to advance their interests and to give expression to their will as we conclude this debate we should reflect on our individual and collective contributions to building a new and better society as we conclude we would do well to reflect on the words of the nigerian author ben okri in his poem on a new dream for politics where he says they say there is only one way for politics that it looks with hard eyes at the hard world and shapes it with a ruler s edge measuring what is possible against acclaim support and votes they say there is only one way to dream for the people to give them not what they need but food for their fears we measure the deeds of politicians by their time in power but in ancient times they had another way they measured greatness by the gold of contentment by the enduring arts the laughter at the hearths the length of silence when the bards told of what was done by those who had the courage to make their lands happy away from war spreading justice and fostering health the most precious of the arts of governance but we live in times that have lost this tough art of dreaming the best for its people or so we are told by cynics and doomsayers who see the end of time in blood red moons always when least expected or unexpected figure rises when dreams here have become like ashes but when the light is woken in our hearts after the long sleep they wonder if it is a fable can we still seek the lost angels of our better natures can we still wish and will for poverty s death and a newer way to undo war and find peace in the labyrinth of the middle east and prosperity in africa as the true way to end the feared tide of immigration we dream of a new politics that will renew the world under their weary suspicious gaze there s always a new way a better way that s not been tried before we are saying let us embark on a new way and perhaps a way that has never been tried before and it up to all of us to make that way possible for our people thank you very much debate concluded the joint sitting adjourned

while politicos like to call tax cuts trickle down economics the real culprit is socialism the robin hood theory of steal from the rich and give to the poor sounds noble however in practice it doesn t work that way the political class tax and spend for their benefit first then some may trickle down to the masses margaret thatcher sums up the problem well citizens gladly take government benefits as long as someone else pays for them while politicians of all flavors are happy to oblige the american people will never knowingly adopt socialism but under the name of liberalism they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program until one day america will be a socialist nation without knowing how it happened i no longer need to run as a presidential candidate for the socialist party norman mattoon thomas 1884 1968 six time presidential candidate for the socialist party of america politicos buying votes with tax dollars offer give away programs to the citizens and politically connected only after protecting themselves and millions of government employees high salaries generous health care family leave and pension benefits garner votes and significant campaign contributions from government workers with each election creative politicos invent new and creative ways to grow and maintain their power spending our tax dollars if tax revenues can t cover the costs the government raises taxes and or borrows money to make up the difference unlike the federal government individual states can t print money is there a breaking point on how much they spend borrow and tax how bad is it three high population states ny il and ca all rank in the top 10 in total tax burden levied on their citizens to pay for enormous give away programs ny is 1 crain s new york business tells us report new york sitting on a debt bomb my emphasis the empire state leads the nation in hidden debt according to a new report new york s ledgers bear some 69 7 billion in unfunded liabilities mainly pensions and health benefits contractually promised to state workers such obligations which states did not have to divulge belie claims of balanced budgets and limit borrowing capacity for future infrastructure projects the massive dollar figure is in addition to 40 9 billion in debt that new york did disclose in its 2017 financial report investor s business daily quotes ny governor cuomo he told his state s citizens that income tax revenues were coming in 2 3 billion below the expectations of just a month ago that s as serious as a heart attack in fiscal year 2020 new york plans to spend around 176 billion with an estimated 100 billion coming from federal funds illinois is ranked 8 illinois pension problems have been well documented this illinoispolicy org headline grabbed my attention my emphasis more than 19 000 illinois government retirees receive pensions over 100k data from illinois six largest pension systems show 19 158 former government workers collect annual pensions of more than 100 000 costing those systems nearly 2 4 billion combined in fiscal year 2018 six figure pensioners enrolled in those systems contributed an average of 160 100 toward their own retirements over the course of their careers and retired on average at age 59 the state s officially reported pension debt sits at 130 billion while moody s investors service lists the state s unfunded pension liability at 250 billion leaving taxpayers on the hook for massive debts they have also caused routine calls for tax hikes at the state level the teachers retirement system is the largest group in 100 000 club with nearly 12 000 pensioners california is ranked 10 pensions investments reported on investment return assumptions of public pension funds with my emphasis calpers is the largest public pension fund in the u s the 311 billion california public employees retirement system reduced its assumed investment rate of return to 7 from 7 5 given the fund s 10 year annualized return of 5 1 however even this return assumption might prove overly optimistic this 2016 la times offers updates calpers is underfunded and unrealistic can it save itself the calpers board of governors finally voted to lower the fund s projected rate of return but only to 6 5 per year realities may make even a 6 5 rate of return too optimistic who is to blame the state employees lived up to their end of the bargain can t blame them if a businessman makes a mistake he suffers the consequences if a bureaucrat makes a mistake you suffer the consequences ayn rand 1905 1982 during the 90 s boom states received record amounts of taxes instead of using the windfall to pay down debt they squandered the money including more expensive future promises past lawmakers bear great responsibility for the states pension problems today while some pension plans were adequately funded things changed in 2008 when the federal government bailed out the banks driving interest rates to historic lows states were slow to react continuing with unrealistic funding projections modern day trickle down socialism has several components confiscate wealth from the working class government is first in line grabbing the major portion for themselves take care of those politically connected who help you stay in power trickle down some of the remainder to the citizens never trickle down too much political power depends on a permanent underclass if you run short of money blame the rich and call them greedy citizens are moving out our article if socialism is so good why are people moving away outlines the exodus from the three high tax states citizens see the states scrambling raising taxes and the cost of government services to cover the costs of political promises made to government employees not for the benefit of ordinary workers many seniors are voting with their feet hoping to see their nest egg last in less expensive areas of the country the hidden agenda i was recently asked why are these states promoting sanctuary cities and illegal immigration they are recruiting people who want to live off the welfare system while putting citizens at risk by harboring criminals wouldn t they be better off reducing welfare and encouraging workers and companies to move there difficult questions and difficult answers a looming showdown the obama administration discontinued the long form census questionnaire that asked a citizenship question when the trump administration added back the citizenship question for the 2020 census all hell broke loose the new york times reports supreme court to hear case on census citizenship question critics say that adding the question on citizenship would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the forms by one government estimate about 6 5 million people might decide not to participate breitbart explains why the socialist states are battling the question democrats understand that the revised 2010 u s census questionnaire which did not ask about interviewee s citizenship under the penalty of perjury encouraged many of california s approximately 2 35 million illegal aliens and 1 65 million legal aliens to participate improperly in the u s census california is ranked as the 1 recipient for total u s federal spending with 343 7 billion in receipts in 2013 for every dollar that california residents paid in federal taxes the state received 1 18 in federal spending it s all about grabbing other people s money while maintaining a permanent government dependent underclass the new york times nyt article a census question that could change how power is divided in america outlines the battle is this person a citizen the answer could mean less representation for populous states and big cities the question could generate the data necessary to redefine how political power is apportioned in america the census determines each state s membership in the house of representatives their electoral votes and allocation of federal tax dollars the high tax states are doing all they can to grab as much federal money as possible even if it means spending more welfare dollars and putting their citizens at personal risk california 53 illinois 18 and new york 27 represent 22 5 of the total membership in the house of representatives the nyt article tells us if 15 percent of noncitizens went uncounted that would be enough to cost california and new york one congressional seat each to the benefit of colorado and montana if we can remove all noncitizens from state population totals and reapportion congress a more drastic move that would require a constitutional amendment this would cost california four seats will the bankrupt states have enough political power to require the rest of america to bail out their lavish government pension plans if so expect the reckless process to continue at the expense of the middle class my wife jo and oldest son were headed out and i asked her to buy a lottery ticket my son raised his eyebrows i said i m willing to spend a couple dollars if we ever won several generations of our family would be set for life he thought for a second and said yeah if they move out of the country boy i hope it never comes to that a personal note i prefer to avoid political issues however when i see the political class regardless of party moving the country in the direction where our life savings and standard of living are the target i feel i must warn my readers i hope you all understand thank you for more

the dovishness of the federal reserve should have been widely negative for the us dollar but instead of extending wednesday s slide the greenback rebounded against all of the major currencies better than expected manufacturing activity in the philadelphia region lower jobless claims and an uptick in leading indicators helped fuel the u turn but the fed s belief that accommodative policy is still needed in face of stronger growth tells us how just how deep their concerns run usd jpy also benefitted from the recovery in stocks but the rally should fizzle near 111 as yesterday s breakdown shifts the pair s outlook aside from the central bank s plans to keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of the year us china trade talks are going nowhere fast the us will be sending mnuchin and lighthizer to china next week for more trade talks but with reports that president trump wants china to double or triple their purchases of us goods an agreement still appears far away as such the 111 00 to 111 25 area could be a great place to reload usd jpy shorts meanwhile sterling fell by the largest amount this year versus the us dollar and not because of the bank of england s monetary policy announcement the boe voted unanimously to leave interest rates unchanged and said brexit could prompt policy moves in either direction they also warned that employment growth could moderate significantly as more companies trigger no deal brexit plans instead of falling sterling rallied after the rate decision because the central bank said gradual limited tightening is probably needed uk retail sales also beat expectations rising 0 4 against a forecast for a 0 4 drop unfortunately with brexit in focus nothing matters more than the european union s response to uk prime minister may s request for a short extension until june 30 2019 and they are not letting her off the hook easily the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier wants the extension to be conditional on a positive vote which means they either accept the current deal or exit with no deal in doing so the eu would raise the stakes but we still don t know if that will be their official response if it is the british pound is in serious trouble we re looking at the strong possibility of an emergency eu summit next week that will prolong the uncertainty and take gbp usd well below 1 30 the swiss national bank also left monetary policy unchanged like the boe there were no surprises snb president jordan said he s moderately optimistic this year but trade conflict italy and brexit are risks the rising dollar also took a big toll on the euro which erased 70 of yesterday s gain if tomorrow s ez pmi reports show ongoing weakness we could see eur usd break below yesterday s low which would completely alter the technical outlook for the pair if the data is strong it would reinforce the anti dollar bias and take eur usd back above 1 14 the australian dollar also fell but held up better than its peers after the unemployment rate dropped below 5 for the first time in 8 years unfortunately a large part of the improvement was caused by lower participation job growth also slowed to 4 6k after rising 38 3k the previous month the new zealand dollar on the other hand was the second worst performing currency although gdp growth accelerated to 0 6 in the fourth quarter year over year growth slowed to 2 3 the weakest pace inn 3 years usd cad shot higher erasing all of yesterday s slide the loonie will be in play tomorrow with retail sales and consumer prices scheduled for release on friday the risk is to the upside because job growth was strong wholesale trade rebounded in january and the price component of ivey pmi increased but the trend is to the upside and any disappointment even if it is small could send the pair even higher

keating was the best treasurer i ve seen by a country mile evans declares he did so much with hawke s help the whole of the 80s and to a lesser extent the 90s were really great for economic policy evans still speaks regularly to keating and recently saw him in sydney at the launch of the biography of david morgan a fellow treasury cum westpac alumnus evans at treasury when he was treasury secretary canberra times evans joined treasury in 1969 and was heavily involved in the reforms that underpinned a record 27 years of consecutive economic growth and higher living standards for australians the sweeping overhaul included tax reforms deregulating the financial system increasing labour market flexibility and floating the currency when then secretary john stone advised keating against the currency float evans told the treasurer he disagreed with the treasury boss advertisement decades later when evans retired as westpac chairman the bank arranged for television host mike munro to hold a special this is your life ceremony with video messages from evans old mates from around the world including keating who impersonated stone s antics on the currency debate you disagree you disagree ted you disagree keating rang out in the re enactment evans is a little hard of hearing and tells a story about his disobedient cavoodle chewing up his hearing aid i speak up better outcomes the currency float in 1983 helped to pave the way for deregulating the labour market evans says labour market reforms were the most important thing that needed to be done inflation had hit 15 per cent in the 1970s and was still nudging double digits in the early 80s as the centralised wage fixation system drove up pay and prices advertisement hawke introduced the prices and incomes accord and unions agreed to trade off wage rises for superannuation later prime minister john howard broke the union stranglehold on the waterfront and extended enterprise bargaining and individual contracts that s why we ve got so much better employment outcomes and a lower inflation rate evans says i ask if howard s politically unpopular 2005 work choices tipped the balance too far in favour of business definitely not evans says defiantly so what does he make of the shorten labor opposition foreshadowing a generous rise in the minimum wage possible reintroduction of pattern bargaining in low wage industries and boosting union rights i think that will be a problem and the start of our going backwards he says the consequences he says will be fewer jobs and higher inflation advertisement labor s proposed minimum wage policy will be a problem and the start of our going backwards evans says rohan thomson evans view is informed by personal experience he left school in year 10 and joined the precursor to telstra the government owned pmg as a telecoms technician i just loved the work and i didn t want to do anything else an older colleague encouraged him to become an engineer and so he completed his school education and starteda mathematics degree at queensland university as an external student then the unions negotiated a 25 per cent pay rise for pmg engineers and evans became a casualty pmg responded by cutting out the cadetship so i lost it evans says it was a brutal lesson in the realities of supply and demand in the labour market evans was forced to drop out of study but ultimately returned to university to study economics snaring a scholarship and graduating with honours an encounter over a drink with leading academic economist max corden convinced him to forgo a phd offer in new zealand and to join treasury in canberra to learn some economics advertisement as much as you learn the economic tools at university your best learning is on the job and being involved in real issues the 28 year old graduate with his second child on the way to his first wife heather was on a meteoric rise evans at westpac in 2010 louie douvis we peruse the menu and evans warns the portions are very big evans opts for the battered flathead fillets i choose the porterhouse steak and order at the counter evans drinks water he says he doesn t drink much alcohol these days and prefers two 500ml cans of german non alcoholic beer each night he jokes he grew up on beer evans and treasury colleagues such as stone chris higgins and morgan who later became westpac chief executive enjoyed after work drinks at the national press club frequented by politicians public servants and journalists in those days as deputy secretary in the 80s and 90s he worked very closely with keating he was secretary when keating was prime minister and worked for treasurers john dawkins ralph willis and peter costello between 1993 and 2001 advertisement evans had been parachuted into canberra as treasury secretary from washington in 1993 after tony cole was let go by treasurer dawkins just three years earlier evans had suffered his first heart attack at the age of 49 heart failure had claimed the life of his father at their ipswich queensland family home when ted was 18 and also later killed his close friend treasury secretary chris higgins evans considers himself lucky to have survived two heart attacks over the decades he has had bypass surgery stents and a defibrillator evans says costello now chairman of nine publisher of afr weekend was highly intelligent and with howard successfully introduced the overdue gst that hawke and keating strongly considered but infamously dropped at the eleventh hour so in evans view why was keating the best he was a very quick learner he had no economics training but listened very carefully and was just very determined he pushed things through advertisement could labor s shadow treasurer chris bowen who speaks to keating most days be a successful reformer like his idol he s not showing any signs of being up to it frankly evans says he doesn t speak enough on things that matter as far as i can see the softly spoken evans had a fierce reputation for standing up to treasurers with a famous death stare and an occasional thumping of his fist on the table according to former colleagues one behind the scenes encounter saw him stand up to prime minister john howard on the importance of reserve bank of australia independence and not publicly hinting on his preference for interest rate changes i suspect it s not quite what it used to be like he says in an oblique reference to the two most recent heads of treasury philip gaetjens and john fraser who were political appointments by the coalition government as much as you learn the economic tools at university your best learning is on the job and being involved in real issues says evans rohan thomson advertisement evans also laments that government appointed advisory boards are not listened to he recently chaired the abc chair selection panel which put forward four candidates only for the government to appoint ita buttrose who wasn t on the shortlist speaking generally he says committees are really a charade by the same token he acknowledges bureaucrats don t have all the wisdom including in financial markets and corporate tax it s why one of his proudest achievements was setting up the board of taxation to advise the government when he joined westpac in 2001 evans admits i was very embarrassed to find out how very little i knew about the operations of the financial markets he had been a regulator at treasury overseeing financial policy it s a canberra problem across all areas of the public service he says they need external advice advertisement outlandish salaries our meals arrive oh look at that he says as the super sized fish and steak are placed on the table we shift our conversation to the banking royal commission evans joined the westpac board in 2001 and became chairman in 2007 before retiring in 2011 evans on screen with wespac director lindsay maxstead and ceo gail kelly in 2011 janie barrett he admits he was surprised by the extent of problems exposed by the commissioner kenneth hayne i d long been very concerned about the wage system in banking evans says the salaries are rather outlandish not chief executives but particularly those involved in markets where in most banks people are paid what they earn in the market using the bank s balance sheet some of it is good risk management but most of it is just betting advertisement westpac had a system that would charge traders for using bank capital to moderate incentives for traders to make risky bets even so they d make a mint some of our traders earned more than many of the executives he says as a bank director the challenge was that the international employment market inflated banker salaries he says evans looks at his plate and says he should stop picking at the pile of chips i ask what he makes of his former treasury colleague henry who was recently forced to quit as national australia bank chairman after the commission s damning findings i feel very sorry for him i think the reaction was grossly overdone he is an outstanding person in every sense advertisement keating was the best treasurer i ve seen by a country mile says ted evans rohan thomson evans henry and morgan worked closely on tax reform for keating ken was a great asset and model builder evans says over cappuccinos we discuss henry s successor at nab phil chronican who was a chief financial officer at westpac he came out of the new zealand treasury and is really good stuff evans says he just understands economics extraordinarily well evans passed over chronican rob whitfield and phil coffey for westpac s top job in favour of gail kelly from st george we were fortunate in westpac to have an excellent ceo in gail kelly the best public speaker i ve ever seen

source xinhua 2019 03 21 19 18 09 editor zx video player close washington march 20 xinhua the u s federal reserve on wednesday left interest rates unchanged after concluding a two day policy meeting in a move that met market expectations and reflected the central bank s patient approach regarding monetary policy changes the fed also announced that it will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings at the end of september keeping interest rates steady in support of the goals of fostering maximum employment and price stability the federal open market committee fomc decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent the central bank said in a statement the fomc the fed s monetary policymaking body continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes said the statement in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes it said addressing a press conference fed chairman jerome powell said he and his colleagues believe that the central bank should be patient in assessing the need for any change in the stance of policy patient means that we see no need to rush to judgment he said it may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation clearly calls for a change in policy rate projections released after the policy meeting showed that 11 of the 17 officials who participated in setting interest rate policy didn t predict any rate hikes whatsoever this year while the rest of the six participants foresaw between one and two increases in december the median projection for the number of rate hikes this year was two asked by a reporter if there will be a big cut in interest rates in the future powell responded by saying that the data the fed is seeing is not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another the median of responses in the march 13 15 bloomberg poll predicted one hike by the fed in september with the upper end of the target range for the federal funds rate touching 2 75 percent economists said that would likely mark the peak of this hiking cycle edwin truman a nonresident senior fellow at the washington based peterson institute for international economics said on tuesday that he predicts there will be at least one more hike probably this year he said he agrees that the hiking cycle is nearing the peak but you don t know where the peak will be in an interview with xinhua truman estimated that the rate s target range at the end of this cycle would probably reach somewhere between the current levels and 3 25 percent not far from where we are he said whether the upper end is three or three and a quarter it depends on the evidence and we don t know what that evidence is going to be modest slowdown of u s economy with respect to the u s economy powell told the press conference that the individual fomc participants views point to a modest slowdown with overall conditions remaining favorable this year the fomc members now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent and core inflation rate which omits the volatile food and energy prices remains close to 2 percent he added powell said fed officials are also very mindful of what the risks are citing examples such as the slowing global growth uncertainties related to britain s exit from the european union as well as the ongoing u s china trade talks truman said there is probably enough strength in the u s economy adding that the chance for a rate hike in early 2020 is less than 50 percent i would be surprised that things go beyond that speaking of china coping with the fed s monetary tightening truman said the country s recent fiscal and monetary policies are serving the economy well adding that he thinks china can handle its economy reasonably well they ve done a pretty good job over the years truman said on the trade disputes between beijing and washington the expert said the issues would not have too much of an impact on the bigger picture of the two economies the trade issues in and of themselves are not dramatic because they are relatively small moves in terms of the total size of the chinese economy or the u s economy truman said adding however that the tension has introduced a level of uncertainty affected investment decisions and had some impact on global slowdown ending balance sheet runoff in a separate statement on wednesday the fed said it intends to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings at the end of september the process known as balance sheet normalization started in october 2017 the central bank intends to slow the reduction of its holdings of treasury securities by reducing the cap on monthly redemptions from the current level of 30 billion u s dollars to 15 billion u s dollars beginning in may according to the statement the fed s asset portfolio as a consequence of the quantitative easing policy following the 2008 financial crisis amounted to about 4 5 trillion dollars when the central bank began to gradually reduce it two years ago powell said the balance sheet will be of a size of approximately 17 percent of gross domestic production gdp around the end of this year down from 25 percent of gdp at the end of 2014 in dollar terms powell added it looks like it ll be a bit above 3 5 trillion the fed powell said does not regard its balance sheet normalization program as a monetary policy tool we still think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months we re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy he said

quarter of 2019 rebounded four points from the previous quarter to 39 2 indicating that confidence among exporters is growing across all sectors and markets progress in the trade talks between mainland china and the united states has led to an improved sentiment however it is still expected the dispute will not be resolved imminently so we are calling on local exporters to expand their business into new markets such as the russian far east and asean countries hong kong trade development council hktdc director of research nicholas kwan said at a press conference today the hktdc export index gauges near term export prospects readings above and below 50 indicate positive and negative sentiment respectively mr kwan noted that the indices remained below the watershed mark of 50 but expansion has been satisfactory especially in the toys sector and european union market which rose 17 1 and 5 6 points respectively our forecast for export growth in 2019 remains unchanged an increase of 5 in value and 3 in volume he said mr kwan added that machinery is the most promising export sector with a score of 42 2 points followed by toys 41 4 and electronics 39 7 in terms of specific export markets japan 48 and the eu 47 4 enjoyed the most positive short term market outlook followed by the united states 46 1 and mainland china 45 7 smaller orders from us buyers hktdc economist doris fung said hong kong exporters were slightly more optimistic than before on the outcome of the sino us trade dispute fewer respondents 51 7 compared with 54 4 in the last quarter were concerned that it might adversely affect their export performance over the near term but despite the increase in optimism almost half of the respondents 48 5 reported they had already experienced a negative impact related to the trade dispute particularly in relation to reduced order sizes 69 other impacts include price bargaining 34 9 cancelled orders 22 7 and sharing or bearing part of the tariff costs 16 2 responding to the trade friction over half of the respondents 54 1 said they had considered developing markets outside the us other plans included moving the production or sourcing base 27 4 and downsizing the company 19 9 russian far east an alternative manufacturing base hktdc assistant principal economist global research louis chan said that with its rich natural resources abundant land upgraded infrastructure unfettered access to the markets of the eurasian economic union eaeu and the availability of generous tax incentives the russian far east district also known as the far eastern federal district fefd is an attractive destination for manufacturing investment the fefd is an especially suitable market for hong kong traders who are operating in the food processing paper and pulp rubber and plastics electrical equipment medicine and jewellery industries mr chan said over the past five years the fefd has set up a ministry and four government agencies to accelerate infrastructure improvement and increase industrial capability in the region one of the most important initiatives is the establishment of the far east development corporation fedc which oversees 18 advanced special economic zones asezs and 22 free ports of vladivostok fpvs municipals amid the lingering sino us trade tension the fefd not only offers emerging manufacturing investment opportunities with unfettered access to eaeu markets but also alternative sources of agricultural products currently affected by us tariffs mr chan said for example some mainland china and russian investors have already started soybean processing in the fefd s amur region and jewish autonomous region to supply the mainland market aquaculture and tourism potential mr chan added that hong kong business can also consider importing a range of products from the fefd the district has access to the waters of north pacific which are a paradise for cold water seafood such as crabs and scallops a range of cosmetics and health supplements has also been developed including face masks derived from sea cucumbers and medicinal products made using the chaga mushroom the fefd is also planning to develop an entertainment zone incorporating resorts and casinos to boost tourism there are plenty of opportunities for hong kong companies to participate in the development of the tourism industry in the fefd in addition to investment and project management they can also provide marketing support for the fefd to promote its tourism to potential asian visitors mr chan explained growing asean e

the telemarketers have invaded cellphones so when i got a call at 11 45 a m on march 7 with a number but no name attached to it i didn t bother to answer my mistake it was jenny donohue sherrod brown s communications director wanting to give me a heads up about something a minute later she sent me an email titled senator will not run for president in 2020 i had been working for several months on a profile of brown as a potential presidential candidate i had just interviewed him the week before had followed him around during his recent tour of early primary and caucus states and had talked to his friends his family and his political associates my piece was due the next day clearly brown s decision to sit out 2020 was not good news for my article but if you re someone who wants to see donald trump defeated in 2020 it was far worse news for the country during the course of my reporting i had come to believe that brown 66 would have made a formidable candidate against trump with brown s longtime experience in politics before becoming a u s senator in 2006 he had served as a state legislator ohio s secretary of state and a member of the u s house of representatives he might also have made a good president as alan tonelson the former research director of a lobby for smaller manufacturing companies and no flaming liberal had told me about brown s grasp of policy he may be the smartest politician i ve ever encountered even though brown won t be the nominee there are still things about his politics and about the way he conducts himself that liberals really should be aware of indeed the remaining democrats path to beating trump may very well lie in extracting some of the key lessons from brown s candidacy that never was and applying them to their own campaigns the country has moved leftward on economic issues since the great recession you could see that in 2014 when voters in solidly republican arkansas alaska south dakota and nebraska approved increases in the minimum wage even as they handed the gop a decisive victory in the midterm elections you could see it in bernie sanders success in the democratic primaries in 2016 or in trump s insurgent campaign when he appeared to side with workers against big business and their washington lobbyists in opposing past trade deals and decrying corporations that moved out of the country in search of cheaper wages and lower taxes in all these instances voters hoped to increase workers incomes and protect their jobs even at the expense of business that s the historical role of the left but at the same time these voters don t necessarily identify as left wing there s an important disjunction here that helps explain brown s appeal in ohio and why he would have made a strong general election candidate brown s history in office and the proposals he embraces are about improving the lot of american workers sometimes at the expense of corporations and the wealthy he was an outspoken foe of the north american free trade agreement and of china s entry into the world trade organization as a developing nation which he charged would doom american manufacturing he was also a harsh critic of the 2017 republican tax bill which he claims gives an incentive for companies to move overseas his current proposals which he promoted during his recent proto campaign dubbed the dignity of work tour would reward companies for investing in american jobs that pay a living wage and charge corporations a freeloader fee when they pay their employees so little that they have to go on food stamps and medicaid and he would raise the earned income tax credit for workers who barely escape poverty these are fundamentally left wing proposals but when i was following brown around new hampshire i was surprised to hear people at his events describe him as a moderate and when he announced that he would not run one headline that ran on a number of news sites was moderate democrat sherrod brown says he s not running for president that identification is reflected in brown s success in ohio where in the last election the 41 percent of the electorate that identified itself as moderate the largest bloc of voters favored brown by 2 to 1 being perceived as moderate rather than right wing or left wing can be a huge advantage in american politics one reason voters might see brown as moderate is his temperament he is not angry his default button is set to joy his wife journalist connie schultz told me he doesn t rail against the billionaire class the way sanders does he appears affable with his tousled hair off the rack suits and new balance sneakers supporters in ohio described him to me as looking like a regular guy here there is an analogy with ronald reagan who benefited from his public affability and informality even as he pursued a very conservative agenda it used to be said that reagan could make extreme proposals sound moderate and barry goldwater could make moderate proposals sound extreme brown has also benefited from avoiding two kinds of political stands that have led self identified moderates to reject politicians they see as left wing first brown doesn t promote potentially disruptive big government programs that could significantly raise taxes this includes medicare for all and the green new deal both of which several democratic candidates have endorsed brown is not dismissive of the problems that these kinds of programs address but he worries about proposing initiatives that could not win popular support and would be difficult to implement when was in the house he actually backed then rep jim mcdermott s single payer alternative to the clinton health care plan in 1994 and he told me that he still sees such a plan as a long term objective for the moment however brown favors making medicare available to people age 50 and older and creating a public option to supplement the private plans offered under the affordable care act i see it as a matter of steps and i don t know how you convince millions of people to drop their private health insurance he told me brown also avoids the extreme social and cultural positions that are today being heavily promoted by young left wing activists he is a longtime advocate of civil rights and women s rights and was one of a minority of democrats to vote in 1996 against the defense of marriage act but when i asked him what he thought about calls to abolish immigration and customs enforcement ice and reparations for african americans he said you don t abolish ice you improve it he didn t comment at all on reparations there s an obvious lesson here in 2020 democrats can advocate left wing economic programs and win in key midwestern states like ohio and michigan there is widespread public support for measures that would raise workers wages and limit the ability of corporations to move out of the country and evade taxes what democrats have to avoid and what brown tried to steer clear of during his brief flirtation with a presidential run are proposals that raise the specter of big government and high taxes as well as social measures that brush aside public fears about safety or benefit one part of working america at the expense of or to the exclusion of another during his recent travels brown spoke about the idea that americans deserve respect and good wages regardless of the kind of work they do as dr martin luther king jr taught us all labor has dignity and no job is really menial if it pays adequate wages brown said in his brunswick ohio speech kicking off the tour the dignity of work means hard work should pay off for everyone no matter who you are or what kind of work you do whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge earn a salary or make tips whether you re raising children or caring for an aging parent regardless of your race or gender brown repeated this statement almost word for word in every speech i heard him give brown s focus on the well being of workers along with his own lack of pretension and casual appearance might create the impression that he himself is a product of the proletariat in a 2012 interview on hardball chris matthews told brown you re the labor guy you re a blue collar kind but nothing could be further from the truth brown s father who was a successful physician in mansfield ohio descended from a long line of prominent ohioans sherrod and his two brothers grew up in a three story colonial in mansfield and spent summers on the family s 285 acre farm all three brown children graduated from ivy league colleges sherrod from yale in 1974 with a degree in russian studies so the question is how sherrod brown became a labor guy one reason is the place he grew up located 80 miles southwest of cleveland mansfield was an industrial boom town during the decades after world war ii westinghouse tappan empire steel and general motors had multi block size plants there ron davis a retired steelworker and union official who went to high school with brown told me the saying was that you could quit your job in the morning and have a new job by lunch but beginning in the 1970s one big plant after another left town what remains are huge empty lots mansfield has lost almost 16 percent of its population that was the reality that brown began to confront when fresh from yale in 1974 he was elected state representative that alone doesn t explain brown however other aspiring politicians have grown up in dying industrial towns without becoming a tribune for its workers former house speaker paul ryan a fierce defender of corporate prerogatives grew up in and later represented janesville wisconsin which was ravaged by factory closeouts instead the most convincing explanation i found for brown s political evolution is the influence of his mother emily campbell brown specifically her combination of political and religious conviction while sherrod s father charles brown was a moderate republican and a man of few words emily brown was a democrat and an eloquent advocate for civil rights religion played a large role in her politics she attended church regularly and spent 20 minutes every morning reading the bible her main activity when brown was growing up was the young women s christian association which was founded to promote christian principles and became active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s in 1972 she was a delegate to its convention on racial justice in new york she was later a board member for habitat for humanity which describes itself as a christian housing ministry she was also a leader of richland county s democratic party and a founder of its women s caucus her photo hangs in the local party office sherrod followed his mother s example at mansfield senior high school he was president of the student council and in 1970 he led a march down the town s main street for earth day he was one of the few white members of the high school s black studies club at yale he worked on multiple political campaigns including george mcgovern s 1972 presidential bid and like his mother he blended christian devotion with politics when he came to congress in 1993 he joined a weekly prayer group brown has said that history s greatest political speech was jesus sermon on the mount and when he married schultz in 2004 he asked their wedding officiant pastor kate matthews to base her sermon on the beatitudes which are part of the sermon on the mount according to schultz brown read the bible all the way through four years ago when i suggested to matthews that brown s politics were shaped by his religions conviction she replied yes i would say that you are exactly right what i observed in sherrod is very much a motivation grounded in faith he really wrestles with the bible and the questions about g od he really is interested in what the bible tells him to do brown s strain of christian advocacy like that of his mother and of his idol martin luther king dates from the 19th century turn of protestants away from individual salvation toward social reform the protestant social gospel informed both progressive and socialist movements in the early 20th century and organizations like the ywca it sought to build the kingdom of god on earth by healing or eliminating the class division that the industrial revolution had created it preached social equality during his dignity of work tour brown quoted a passage from the new testament s book of matthew chapter 25 that was a central text of the social gospel in it jesus praises those who feed the hungry tend the sick clothe the naked and take in the stranger what is done for the least of these and condemns those who give the thirsty nothing to drink advised by matthews brown translated the least of these to those who are less important john judis is not worth less than jenny is he interjected during our interview referring to his communications head who was sitting with us that passage brown explained increasingly drives me in this world brown told me that he considered being a politician a calling rather than a career indeed the title of his tour the dignity of work more closely resembles the title of a sermon than the slogan for a political campaign brown fully acknowledges his mother s influence i asked him who he would substitute for jesus in the question what would jesus do and the first name that came to his mind was his mother the one area where brown rebelled from her was in his dress amy burns a mansfield schoolteacher who got to know emily brown later in her life describes her as being elegant and recalls her being concerned about her son s unruly hair it was a rebellion in the sense that everything was in the late 60s and early 70s brown told me but it has become i think an expression of his political and religious conviction by eschewing brioni suits and gucci loafers brown is displaying his determination not to appear more important than his constituents it s matthew 25 in reviving a tradition that helped produce the progressive era and the new deal as well as the civil rights revolution of the 1960s brown is reclaiming religion and christianity from the religious right and the republicans and at a moment when liberals are increasingly describing themselves as socialists a word that has often been associated with hard line secularism brown s worldview is a reminder that liberal and democratic socialist advocacy arose out of and can continue to base itself consciously or not on an enduring american religious tradition i don t know why brown decided not to run i suspect from his statements afterward that his heart was not in the long slog of a campaign but just as i became convinced that brown would have made a formidable general election candidate i became equally convinced that he would not get the democratic nomination here s the political science version the calendar was against him he could expect to be strongest in the industrial midwest but before democrats got around to voting in ohio and michigan on march 10 they would have already gone through new england the deep south texas and california other candidates stood a much better chance of winning those places and if brown failed to make a significant showing in those states his funding would dry up and even in the midwest and in pennsylvania which doesn t vote until april brown might have had to divide the working class vote with former vice president joe biden there were however deeper reasons brown would probably not have won the nomination in ohio brown has appeal across the democratic electorate but in the deepest recesses of his politics he is an evangelist for what he calls the the people that are invisible in society the worker of modest means and status this goes back to the thousands of workers who lost their jobs when mansfield s factories shut down more recently it is the former workers at general motors newly shuttered plant in lordstown ohio who have been pushed aside by gm as brown charged in his brunswick speech he recounted how one woman from the plant had told him all we want is to get up and work hard support our families build a nest egg and have decent health care and retirement but those jobs are getting harder and harder to come by she s right brown exclaimed this vision of politics doesn t resonate among many of the young upscale democrats on the coasts who increasingly dominate the democratic party on a saturday night in february i watched brown give the keynote address at the well attended annual convention of new hampshire s young democrats it s a large and important group in state politics that extends from high school student council presidents to young state legislators candidates including those for president draw volunteers and even staff from this group brown gave his standard dignity of work speech but many of the details seemed to elude the audience he told them of his wife s father being a proud member of the utility workers local 270 he assured them that you shouldn t need a second or third job just to make ends meet he inserted lines about not being able to afford a starter home and needing to drive an uber at night just to make a rent but you could feel him losing the crowd by halfway through some of the young people were looking at their smartphones or quietly chatting while brown spoke some of them started heading for exits before he was finished the second reason brown would have had trouble in the primaries is that dutiful legislator that he is he tends to become fixated on means not eventual ends or on what might be immediately possible to the exclusion of what is eventually desirable in brown s speech to the young democrats he expressed sympathy for students who were drowning in college debt and proposed increasing pell grants and forgiving loans after 20 years when most of the students in the audience would be middle aged at a small meeting in las vegas sponsored by a community organization called make it work nevada brown was asked by a distraught young woman who had fallen between the cracks of the affordable care act why medicare for all wasn t the best solution he responded like a pragmatic legislator i just know that mitch mcconnell won t pass medicare for all he said consider the difference between brown s approach to politics and that of bernie sanders who was once one of brown s closest friends and political allies brown like sanders criticizes past democratic administrations from the left i think no president has stood up in my memory to corporate interests who have outsourced jobs or to wall street brown told me and brown would share some of sanders s ultimate objectives such as single payer health insurance but while brown focuses on the intermediate steps sanders focuses entirely on the ends sanders whose lodestar was another leading proponent of the social gospel socialist party leader eugene v debs passionately advocates for medicare for all the green new deal tuition free college education and a federal job guarantee for the unemployed but he does not spell out the pragmatic steps needed to achieve these objectives they would simply be part of a political revolution sanders approach which other candidates are increasingly adopting won enthusiastic support in 2016 among primary voters and continues to do so but if ultimate ends are not paired with realistic means it could lead to disaster in a general election in colorado in 2016 voters gave their electoral votes to hillary clinton but also defeated a sanders backed referendum for a single payer health care system by a margin of 4 to 1 by contrast brown s attention to immediate detail and moderate achievable initiatives might have fared very well in a general election against a president who has acquired a reputation for erratic extremism brown s proposals to shore up our health insurance system by instituting a public option and allowing 50 year olds to obtain medicare would capture the center and the left from a president who has endorsed plans to gut the affordable care act and to cut medicare and while brown s attention to factory shutdowns corporate freeloading and the earned income tax cut and his celebration of street sweepers waitresses and laid off autoworkers might not have excited some primary voters all of this might well have resonated among voters in crucial swing states in the general election democratic voters may not rue his absence in the primaries but come november 2020 they might wish he had stayed in the race unless that is other democratic candidates decide to borrow from the sherrod brown playbook every weekday jewishworldreview com

jerome powell even more dovish than expected the federal reserve america s central bank delivered its latest decision on monetary policy yesterday the fed is now clearly worried that it has done too much tightening already so it was very much back to business as usual surprise the market by being even more dovish than expected subscribe to moneyweek subscribe to moneyweek today and get your first

daily newsletter don t miss the latest investment and personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up the question is will it be enough the end of quantitative tightening is nigh the us central bank is by now well known for keeping a close eye on the stockmarket s reaction when it sets monetary policy this was christened the greenspan put back in the days when alan greenspan was in charge the belief was that you didn t need to worry too much about the downside in markets because the central bank would always be ready to cut interest rates if stocks fell too far and too fast so far that has broadly proved to be the case the put was maintained following the financial crisis under ben bernanke and janet yellen the belief in its existence was shaken under new chairman jerome powell during 2018 but at the start of this year he did a u turn and now he s making sure that the market knows that he has its back so what came out of the latest meeting first things first the federal reserve doesn t expect to raise interest rates again this year and it only expects to raise them once by the end of 2021 just a few months ago the expectation was for two rate rises by the end of 2019 so this is a big shift in the direction of much easier monetary policy although it s worth noting that the market is now starting to price in a cut in rates for next year more importantly the fed has outlined when it will call a halt to quantitative tightening qt the process of reversing quantitative easing it will be doing less qt from may and it will stop altogether in september in other words the fed is going to stop taking money out of the financial markets which is one of the key things that rattled markets so badly towards the end of last year from then on the plan is that the fed will keep getting rid of its mortgage backed securities but that it will replace those with us treasury bonds in other words it will just be swapping one for the other rather than taking money out of the system why aren t markets happier this is what markets want to hear they want a dovish fed yet they didn t exactly roar ahead yes the s p 500 rallied at first but it couldn t hang on to the gains by the end of the day clearly markets are rattled that powell really does know something that they don t and that a full on slump is around the corner and it s true that the most recent economic data from the us doesn t look great equally there are the ongoing jitters over the us trade war with china to contend with murmurings that there might not be a deal after all which seem to amount to little more than the usual gossip and chit chat helped to unnerve investors towards the end of the session but the other big issue is bond yields the idea that the fed will be buying more treasuries later in the year helped to drive the price of us government bonds sharply higher which means that yields fell but this is also what you d expect to see if investors are becoming more worried about the state of the economy the yield on the ten year us treasury is now at its lowest level in a year this does not indicate optimism about the outlook it does not suggest that investors expect inflation to take off any moment now indeed it indicates that investors reckon the economy has already peaked another problem with falling bond yields is that at these levels it is not very healthy for the banking sector it s a longish story but the upshot is that it makes them less profitable and like it or not banks are still an important part of the economy if banks are struggling then they won t be lending and if they re not lending then it s harder for businesses to expand and grow this does rather indicate the problem with having interest rates so low for so long you can argue about the direction of the causation until the cows come home but there is a risk that your economy becomes mired in quicksand ultra low interest rates interfere with the process of efficient capital allocation which is the fundamental point of free markets you get overcapacity across the board because no one is going bust as a result you bake deflation into your economy because as soon as you withdraw monetary support you run the risk that this overcapacity causes a collapse of course this could also all be a scare these things feed off each other markets are worried because they think the fed knows something they don t the fed is worried because it doesn t want to cop the blame for being too slow to react if this does turn into a recession what s the upshot watch and wait and keep an eye on the dollar of all the risk on risk off indicators this is the trend that matters most and certainly the fed s actions should make for a weaker dollar all else being equal so stick to your plan invest in good value markets and own some gold and if you haven t already subscribed to moneyweek do so now and get your first six issues free

washington the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week pointing to still strong labor market conditions though the pace of job growth has slowed after last year s robust gains other data on thursday showed a measure of factory activity in the mid atlantic region rebounding sharply this month after falling into negative territory in february for the first time in more than 2 1 2 years but manufacturers perceptions about the outlook were the least favorable in three years and their expectations for capital spending were also less upbeat these findings support the view that the manufacturing sector is slowing in line with softening economic growth the federal reserve held interest rates steady on wednesday and its policymakers abandoned projections for further rate increases this year noting that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter the u s economy has clearly slowed and will cause job growth to moderate which isn t alarming as long as it is orderly said ryan sweet a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9 000 to a seasonally adjusted 221 000 for the week ended march 16 the labor department said on thursday economists polled by reuters had forecast claims falling to 225 000 in the latest week claims have been drifting in the middle of their 200 000 253 000 range this year the four week moving average of initial claims considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility rose 1 000 to 225 000 last week the claims data covered the survey week for the nonfarm payrolls portion of march s employment the four week average of claims fell 11 000 between the february and march survey periods suggesting a pickup in job growth after hiring almost stalled last month nonfarm payrolls increased by only 20 000 jobs in february the fewest since september 2017 the slowdown followed big gains in december and january average job growth has moderated to about 165 500 per month from 223 250 per month in 2018 despite the slowdown in employment growth the labor market remains solid the unemployment rate is at 3 8 percent and annual wage growth in february was the strongest since 2009 the step down in hiring reflects a shortage of workers and softening economic growth as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades a trade war between the united states and china slowing global growth and uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union are also hurting domestic activity ebbing momentum the slow growth theme was also underscored by another report on thursday from the conference board showing its leading economic index which measures future u s economic activity rose in february for the first time in five months february s 0 2 percent increase in the leading indicator followed an unchanged reading in january the leading indicator s growth rate has slowed in the past six months which the conference board said suggested that while the economy will continue to expand in the near term its pace of growth could decelerate by year end gross domestic product estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 0 4 percent annualized rate the economy grew at a 2 6 percent pace in the fourth quarter the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies while stocks on wall street rose u s treasury prices were generally higher in a third report on thursday the philadelphia fed said its business conditions index jumped to 13 7 in march from 4 1 in february which was the first negative reading since may 2016 but the survey s measure of new orders received by factories in the region which covers eastern pennsylvania southern new jersey and delaware rebounded moderately from negative territory in february and unsold goods piled up in addition the survey s six month business conditions index dropped to a reading of 21 8 this month the lowest since february 2016 from 31 3 in february its six month capital expenditures index fell to a reading of 19 5 in march from 31 7 in the prior month the index dropped below 20 for the first time since 2016 the details within the report were much more of a mixed bag and more downbeat than one might think given the solid improvement in the headline reading said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york these readings are in line with other surveys showing signs of slowing national factory activity a report from the new york fed last week showed a gauge of factory activity in new york state dropped to a two year low in march the philadelphia fed survey also showed more factories experiencing difficulty finding workers which could weigh on production in the future nearly 74 percent of the firms reported labor shortages up from 63 8 percent last year just over half of the companies also reported they had positions that have remained vacant for more than 90 days that compared to 47 8 percent in 2018

upbeat these findings support the view that the manufacturing sector is slowing in line with softening economic growth the federal reserve held interest rates steady on wednesday and its policymakers abandoned projections for further rate increases this year noting that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter the u s economy has clearly slowed and will cause job growth to moderate which isn t alarming as long as it is orderly said ryan sweet a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9 000 to a seasonally adjusted 221 000 for the week ended march 16 the labor department said on thursday economists polled by reuters had forecast claims falling to 225 000 in the latest week claims have been drifting in the middle of their 200 000 253 000 range this year the four week moving average of initial claims considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility rose 1 000 to 225 000 last week the claims data covered the survey week for the nonfarm payrolls portion of march s employment the four week average of claims fell 11 000 between the february and march survey periods suggesting a pickup in job growth after hiring almost stalled last month nonfarm payrolls increased by only 20 000 jobs in february the fewest since september 2017 the slowdown followed big gains in december and january average job growth has moderated to about 165 500 per month from 223 250 per month in 2018 despite the slowdown in employment growth the labor market remains solid the unemployment rate is at 3 8 percent and annual wage growth in february was the strongest since 2009 the step down in hiring reflects a shortage of workers and softening economic growth as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades a trade war between the united states and china slowing global growth and uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union are also hurting domestic activity ebbing momentum the slow growth theme was also underscored by another report on thursday from the conference board showing its leading economic index which measures future u s economic activity rose in february for the first time in five months february s 0 2 percent increase in the leading indicator followed an unchanged reading in january the leading indicator s growth rate has slowed in the past six months which the conference board said suggested that while the economy will continue to expand in the near term its pace of growth could decelerate by year end gross domestic product estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 0 4 percent annualized rate the economy grew at a 2 6 percent pace in the fourth quarter the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies while stocks on wall street rose u s treasury prices were generally higher in a third report on thursday the philadelphia fed said its business conditions index jumped to 13 7 in march from 4 1 in february which was the first negative reading since may 2016 but the survey s measure of new orders received by factories in the region which covers eastern pennsylvania southern new jersey and delaware rebounded moderately from negative territory in february and unsold goods piled up in addition the survey s six month business conditions index dropped to a reading of 21 8 this month the lowest since february 2016 from 31 3 in february its six month capital expenditures index fell to a reading of 19 5 in march from 31 7 in the prior month the index dropped below 20 for the first time since 2016 the details within the report were much more of a mixed bag and more downbeat than one might think given the solid improvement in the headline reading said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york these readings are in line with other surveys showing signs of slowing national factory activity a report from the new york fed last week showed a gauge of factory activity in new york state dropped to a two year low in march the philadelphia fed survey also showed more factories experiencing difficulty finding workers which could weigh on production in the future nearly 74 percent of the firms reported labor shortages up from 63 8 percent last year just over half of the companies also reported they had positions that have remained vacant for more than 90 days that compared to 47 8 percent in 2018
