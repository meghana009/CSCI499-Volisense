update on economic and monetary developments summary incoming information since the last governing council meeting in early december is in line with the governing council s baseline scenario of ongoing but moderate growth of the euro area economy in particular the weakness in the manufacturing sector remains a drag on euro area growth momentum at the same time ongoing albeit decelerating employment growth and increasing wages continue to support the resilience of the euro area economy the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets remain tilted to the downside but have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding while inflation developments remain subdued overall there are some signs of a moderate increase in underlying inflation in line with expectations against this background the governing council kept its monetary policy stance unchanged at its meeting on 23 january 2020 the unfolding monetary policy measures are underpinning favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy in particular easier borrowing conditions for firms and households are supporting consumer spending and business investment this will sustain the euro area expansion the build up of domestic price pressures and thus the robust convergence of inflation to the governing council s medium term aim global economic activity remains moderate but there are signs of stabilisation in particular the global manufacturing sector firmed in the last quarter of 2019 while the services sector remained broadly stable global trade remains weak amid signs of stabilisation a preliminary trade deal between china and the united states has led to an easing of trade tensions which should contribute to removing impediments to trade growth looking ahead global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained while the balance of risks to global economic activity although less pronounced remains tilted to the downside since the governing council meeting in december 2019 movements in euro area financial markets have been limited with asset prices continuing to be supported by accommodative monetary policy and improved risk sentiment as trade tensions have further receded long term risk free rates are broadly unchanged and the eonia forward curve has shifted slightly upwards continuing to signal market expectations of an unchanged deposit facility rate in the coming months sovereign spreads have remained broadly stable over this period equity prices have increased amid lower risk premia and corporate bond spreads have decreased slightly in foreign exchange markets the euro has weakened slightly in trade weighted terms euro area real gdp increased by 0 3 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2019 following growth of 0 2 in the second quarter this pattern of moderate growth reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued global uncertainties which has particularly affected the euro area manufacturing sector and has also dampened investment growth at the same time the services and construction sectors remain more resilient despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019 incoming economic data and survey information point to some stabilisation in euro area growth dynamics with near term growth expected to be similar to rates observed in previous quarters looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower growth in global activity euro area annual hicp inflation increased to 1 3 in december 2019 from 1 0 in november reflecting mainly higher energy price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to hover around current levels in the coming months while indicators of inflation expectations remain at low levels recently they have either stabilised or ticked up slightly measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted although there are further indications of a moderate increase in line with previous expectations while labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass through to inflation over the medium term inflation is expected to increase supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth regarding monetary developments broad money m3 growth stood at 5 6 in november 2019 broadly unchanged since august m3 growth continues to be backed up by bank credit creation and the narrow monetary aggregate m1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth the growth of loans to firms and households remained solid benefiting from the ongoing support provided by the ecb s accommodative monetary policy stance which is reflected in very low bank lending rates while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged from october at 3 5 in november the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations moderated to 3 4 from 3 8 in october likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy however credit standards for both loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged pointing to still favourable credit supply conditions the governing council s accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing across all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium sized enterprises combining the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis the governing council confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term on the basis of this assessment the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged and expects them to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics the governing council confirmed that it will continue to make net purchases under the ecb s asset purchase programme app at a monthly pace of 20 billion it expects them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of the ecb policy rates and to end shortly before the governing council starts raising the key ecb interest rates the governing council also intends to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation in the light of the continued subdued inflation outlook the governing council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term the governing council s forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook in any case the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry the governing council also decided to launch a review of the ecb s monetary policy strategy the review will encompass the quantitative formulation of price stability the monetary policy toolkit the economic and monetary analyses and communication practices other considerations such as financial stability employment and environmental sustainability will also be part of the review which is expected to be concluded by the end of 2020 the review will be based on thorough analysis and open minds accordingly the eurosystem will engage with all stakeholders external environment the outlook for global economic activity excluding the euro area remains subdued but has been showing signs of stabilisation the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi excluding the euro area increased moderately in december the manufacturing component in particular recovered in the fourth quarter signalling a firming of global manufacturing activity which had gradually weakened since early 2018 the services sector remained resilient and grew further in december see chart 1 chart 1 global output pmi excluding the euro area diffusion indices sources markit and ecb calculations notes the latest observations are for december 2019 risks to the global outlook remain elevated but are less skewed to the downside the partial us china trade agreement represents a welcome easing of trade tensions the so called phase 1 deal includes a commitment from china to purchase a substantial amount of a broad range of us agricultural and other goods and services which may affect demand for eu exports to china it also aims to bring about changes in areas ranging from exchange rate policy to intellectual property protection and technology transfer the us trade representative has clarified that certain existing tariffs will be reduced including the september 2019 tariffs which will be halved and that the planned december 2019 tariffs will be postponed indefinitely moreover china has dropped duties that were to come into effect alongside the us tariffs previously scheduled for december and will continue to hold back from introducing retaliatory tariffs on us made automobiles and auto parts financial conditions continued to loosen on the back of easing trade tensions financial conditions remain very loose by historical standards in advanced economies this dynamic is partly related to the exceptional response by central banks to the great recession of 2007 09 and the relatively weak global economic performance in recent years in emerging markets financial conditions also remain accommodative but have not eased to the same extent on account of the current broad based strength of the us dollar looking ahead in 2020 financial conditions will benefit from anchored inflation rate expectations firms expectations of earnings growth in the united states and other major economies and a possible further easing of trade tensions the global trade momentum remains weak albeit amid signs of stabilisation global merchandise imports continued to increase moderately in october while the global pmi for new export orders excluding the euro area continued to recover in december for the fourth quarter as a whole the global pmi for new export orders increased significantly relative to the third quarter with the index nearing the neutral threshold see chart 2 the recent easing of trade tensions further serves to remove impediments to global trade activity in line with this outlook high frequency trade data are on balance consistent with low but positive growth in world trade chart 2 surveys and global trade in goods excluding the euro area left hand scale three month on three month percentage changes right hand scale diffusion indices sources markit cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis and ecb calculations note the latest observations are for october 2019 for global merchandise imports and december 2019 for the pmis global inflation rose further in november annual consumer price inflation in the countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd increased to 1 8 in november driven in part by high food price inflation in selected emerging market economies including china and india meanwhile inflation excluding energy and food increased only marginally to 2 1 in november from 2 0 in the previous month looking ahead global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained wage growth in advanced economies continues to be moderate despite a tightening of labour markets and rising capacity constraints oil markets have remained broadly stable oil prices were supported only temporarily by the opec group of major oil producers who extended their production cuts in early december prices spiked at around usd 70 per barrel in early january following a rise in tensions in the middle east but fell back quickly after tensions eased with high levels of inventories and us shale oil production together with the international energy agency projecting global oil demand to slow in the first quarter of 2020 oil markets are expected to remain well supplied despite the recent opec agreement total non oil prices increased slightly 1 7 as both metal prices 1 2 and food prices rose 2 8 economic growth in the united states remained moderate in the third quarter of 2019 annualised us real gdp growth stood at 2 1 despite the modest pick up in activity from second quarter growth of 2 0 economic activity moderated as a result of weak investment the fading effect of the 2018 tax reform and the maturing business cycle risks to the outlook have eased somewhat but are still tilted to the downside while trade tensions with china have eased the recent announcement by boeing to halt indefinitely the production of its 737 max in january represents a new risk the net impact on the economy so far has been modest as a decline in deliveries has been offset by accumulating inventories looking ahead however weakness in the manufacturing sector is likely to persist apart from the issues at boeing prolonged trade uncertainties subdued global growth and the broad based appreciation of the us dollar in recent years continue to weigh on the economy in japan the government has prepared a stimulus package to support economic growth in early december the government of prime minister abe announced a fiscal package to tackle downside risks to activity stemming from a weak external environment and recent natural disasters under the package fiscal spending amounts to 2 4 of gdp which puts it among the largest fiscal stimulus packages enacted under abenomics the package will largely be implemented in 2020 21 it should be noted that the impact of the package on the economy partially offsets the recent increase in vat in addition weak manufacturing pushed growth into negative territory in the last quarter of 2019 the economy is expected to return to moderate positive growth in early 2020 as the impact of transitory factors dissipates and fiscal spending takes effect consumer price inflation has accelerated slightly annual headline inflation increased to 0 5 in november looking ahead subdued wage growth and expectations of stable inflation at low levels imply a weak reflation momentum in the economy in the united kingdom economic activity appears to have slowed progressively over the fourth quarter of 2019 confidence indicators remain subdued and well below their historical averages the outcome of the december election and the large majority obtained by prime minister johnson remove the short term risk of a no deal brexit at the end of january as the withdrawal agreement has now become law however the united kingdom is facing a tight deadline to reach an agreement on its future relationship with the european union towards the end of 2020 and therefore policy uncertainty remains high the preliminary trade agreement between the united states and china removes some of the obstacles to chinese economic activity and trade china s economy is showing signs of stabilisation and should benefit from the phase 1 trade deal with the united states the trade agreement can further support growth by improving net trade and lowering trade related uncertainty meanwhile annual headline cpi inflation stabilised in december at 4 5 but remained above the official target the december reading remained elevated owing to ongoing high food price inflation stemming from the outbreak of african swine fever and its impact on pork prices the latter rose by 97 in year on year terms in december down from 110 in november at the same time cpi inflation excluding energy and food remained unchanged at 1 4 in december financial developments long term sovereign yields in the euro area were broadly unchanged over the review period amid some volatility following the large decrease in 2019 over the period under review 12 december 2019 to 22 january 2020 the gdp weighted euro area ten year sovereign bond yield decreased by 1 basis point to 0 20 see chart 3 there was some volatility however with easing trade tensions following the signing of a phase 1 us china trade deal and increasing geopolitical tensions between the united states and iran ten year sovereign bond yields in both the united kingdom and the united states decreased slightly over the review period to 0 63 and 1 77 respectively chart 3 ten year sovereign bond yields

january 2020 euro area sovereign bond spreads relative to the risk free overnight index swap ois rate remained broadly stable in the review period for all countries except spain where the spread narrowed slightly the spread on spanish ten year sovereign bonds decreased by 4 basis points to 48 basis points following the formation of a new coalition government after an eight month standstill overall the gdp weighted spread for the euro area decreased by 1 basis point to 25 basis points broad indices of euro area equity prices rose amid receding trade uncertainty in a continuation of the trend that started in early 2019 equity prices of euro area financial and non financial corporations nfcs increased by 0 2 and 3 3 respectively in the review period the positive development of nfc equity prices was supported by a reduction in the equity risk premium which may partly reflect some relaxation of both global trade tensions and near term risks related to brexit euro area corporate bond spreads decreased mildly over the review period the positive risk sentiment was also reflected in lower corporate bond spreads the spreads on both investment grade nfc bonds and financial sector bonds relative to the risk free rate decreased slightly to stand at 55 and 67 basis points respectively although corporate bond spreads are currently above the lows reached in early 2018 they remain some 50 basis points below the levels observed in march 2016 prior to the announcement and subsequent launch of the corporate sector purchase programme the euro overnight index average eonia and the new benchmark euro short term rate str averaged 46 and 55 basis points respectively over the review period excess liquidity decreased by approximately 51 billion to around 1 740 billion this decline mainly reflects voluntary repayments in the second series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro ii and to a lesser extent an increase in liquidity absorbing autonomous factors the eonia forward curve shifted slightly upwards over the review period as markets do not expect an imminent reduction in the deposit facility rate by the end of 2022 the curve reaches 10 basis points above the current level of the eonia overall it remains below zero for horizons up to 2025 reflecting continued market expectations of a prolonged period of negative interest rates in foreign exchange markets the euro weakened slightly in trade weighted terms over the review period see chart 4 the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro as measured against the currencies of 38 of the euro area s most important trading partners depreciated by 0 9 this largely reflected a depreciation of the euro against the chinese renminbi by 2 4 and the currencies of other major emerging economies in asia as investor sentiment towards emerging economies improved on the prospect of a reduction in trade tensions the euro also weakened against the swiss franc by 1 7 as well as to a lesser extent against the us dollar by 0 4 and the pound sterling by 0 1 but strengthened against the japanese yen by 0 8 chart 4 changes in the exchange rate of the euro vis à vis selected currencies percentage changes source ecb notes eer 38 is the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro against the currencies of 38 of the euro area s most important trading partners a positive negative change corresponds to an

moderate pace in the third quarter of 2019 output in the euro area rose by 0 3 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2019 following growth of 0 2 in the second quarter see chart 5 domestic demand contributed negatively to gdp growth and changes in inventories also provided a small negative contribution while net trade made a positive contribution however these contributions to growth were

spending private consumption rose by 0 5 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2019 which is the strongest rate of expansion since the third quarter of 2017 household real disposable income has been largely unaffected by the recent economic slowdown annual growth of real gross disposable income rose from 2 2 in the second quarter to 2 3 in the third quarter overall employment growth has continued to support labour income in addition lower direct taxes and social security contributions reflecting fiscal measures in a number of euro area countries have contributed positively to households purchasing power the savings ratio increased further in the third quarter of 2019 as income growth outpaced consumption growth looking ahead private consumption should continue to underpin growth in the euro area recent data on the volume of retail sales and new passenger car registrations point to somewhat lower consumption growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the previous quarter however other indicators support the picture of fairly robust consumption dynamics consumer confidence which started to decline at the end of 2017 has stabilised and remained broadly steady over the course of 2019 the latest survey results also signal continued albeit slowing employment growth which should continue to support household income and consumer spending business investment is expected to remain subdued in a context of still elevated uncertainty and weak profit margins but supported by favourable financing conditions according to the latest quarterly national accounts data for the euro area non construction investment declined sharply in the third quarter of 2019 7 7 quarter on quarter following strong growth in the second quarter 10 3 quarter on quarter however this is mostly due to the incorporation of volatile irish data for the most recent quarters reflecting developments in investment in intellectual property products looking through this volatility incoming data suggest rather moderate or even negative investment growth in the euro area for instance annual growth in investment in machinery and equipment has slowed gradually since 2018 see chart 7 as regards near term development in october and november 2019 industrial production of capital goods stood on average 1 4 below its average level in the previous quarter in the period to december industrial confidence in the capital goods production sector stabilised at levels below its historical average despite rising in the third quarter firms profit margins remain weak in a context of ongoing elevated uncertainty moreover according to the november 2019 eib investment survey the number of eu manufacturing firms planning to reduce investment in the next 12 months has risen for the first time in four years see box 6 entitled business outlook surveys as indicators of euro area real business investment the softer investment outlook reflects more widespread expectations of a deterioration in the economic political and regulatory outlook over the next 12 months the european commission biannual investment survey from the end of november also points to modest euro area industrial investment growth in 2020 on a more positive note favourable financing conditions continue to support business investment chart 7 non construction investment and components year on year percentage changes and percentage point contributions sources eurostat and ecb calculations notes non construction investment is decomposed into a machinery and equipment and b investment in intellectual property products excluding cultivated biological resources which have a very small weight the chart shows an aggregation of the four largest eu member states data housing investment should maintain its moderate momentum over the near term supported by buoyant demand and favourable financing conditions but limited by supply side constraints according to the latest quarterly national accounts construction investment and its housing component grew strongly in the third quarter 0 9 and 1 1 respectively quarter on quarter after a modest contraction in the previous quarter 0 3 and 0 1 respectively quarter on quarter together with the latest outcomes for construction production and building permits short term and survey indicators suggest that the moderate growth momentum in housing investment is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2019 in this period housing investment is expected to be supported mainly by strong housing demand as shown by rising spending intentions on housing and strong demand for housing loans while some positive signals have also emerged on the supply side in particular looking at the pmi for housing activity extra euro area exports of goods show some signs of stabilisation while imports and intra euro area trade weakened further in the fourth quarter of 2019 after a rebound in export growth in the third quarter of 2019 from negative growth in the previous quarter preliminary trade goods data to november indicate a stabilisation of extra euro area exports which have been characterised by pronounced volatility most likely associated with stockpiling behaviour related to concerns about the possibility of a hard brexit in october 2019 data show relatively resilient growth in exports to the united states and a firming recovery in exports to turkey and china while exports to the rest of asia remain subdued on the other hand intra euro area goods exports and imports declined in october and november reflecting weakness in euro area industrial production and activity the latest release of national accounts data shows a marked decline in imports in the third quarter of 2019 mostly driven by trade in services which contracted strongly by 5 1 after posting 8 4 growth quarter on quarter in the second quarter however this was mainly driven by irish data leading indicators point to below trend dynamics for extra euro area exports while the pmi for new manufacturing export orders improved to 47 3 which is nevertheless still in contraction territory the european commission s indicator on the assessment of export order books fell again in december at the same time signals from shipping indicators are more positive incoming data and survey results point to ongoing positive but moderate economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 weak global trade together with a prolonged period of uncertainty continue to hamper the overall performance of output growth in the euro area for instance industrial production stood below its average level in the third quarter thus pointing to a further quarter on quarter fall in production in the fourth quarter as regards more timely survey data in the fourth quarter both the european commission s esi and the composite output pmi were below their respective average levels in the third quarter looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions in addition growth is likely to be underpinned by further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower growth in global activity the results of the latest round of the ecb survey of professional forecasters conducted in early january showed that the private sector gdp growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021 had only been revised marginally compared with the previous round conducted in early october although the risks surrounding the outlook for growth in the euro area related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging market economies remain tilted to the downside they have become somewhat less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding prices and costs hicp inflation increased to 1 3 in december 2019 up from 1 0 in november 2019 the increase reflected increases in energy

deflation edged down after increasing during most of 2019 and remains below the levels observed prior to the announcement of the asset purchase programme in 2015 at the same time the forward profile of market based indicators of inflation expectations continues to point to the risk of a prolonged period of low inflation the results of the ecb survey of professional forecasters spf for the first

securities under the corporate sector purchase programme the latest observation is for november 2019 credit to the private sector has remained the main source of money growth followed by external monetary inflows in november the contribution of credit to the private sector and of external monetary inflows remained broadly unchanged see respectively the blue and yellow portions of the bars in chart 10 the support from external monetary inflows to m3 growth since october 2018 has reflected ongoing interest of foreign investors in euro area assets in particular newly issued government securities the termination of net monthly asset purchases under the asset purchase programme app at the end of 2018 had implied that the contribution from general government securities held by the eurosystem started to fade out see the red portion of the bars in chart 10 in early 2019 while the reactivation of the app in november 2019 has so far only had limited influence on m3 growth furthermore the drag from longer term financial liabilities remained small see the dark green portion of the bars in chart 10 loans to the private sector have continued to grow at a solid rate the annual growth rate of mfi loans to the private sector adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling stood at 3 6 in november 2019 after 3 7 in october see chart 11 this development was mainly due to a decrease in the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations nfcs which fell to 3 4 in november from 3 8 in october the moderation in nfc loan dynamics is in line with the slowdown of economic activity observed since 2018 loans to households grew at an annual rate of 3 5 in november 2019 unchanged from october overall loan growth continued to benefit from historically low bank lending rates and the overall favourable supply of bank loans while the slowdown in economic activity dampened loan demand as also indicated by the results of the latest euro area bank lending survey chart 11 loans to the private sector annual growth rate source ecb notes loans are adjusted for loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling the latest observation is for november 2019 the january 2020 euro area bank lending survey found that credit standards for loans to enterprises and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged competition from other banks continued to contribute to an easing of credit standards for enterprises and households in the case of loans to enterprises there was a tightening impact stemming from risk perceptions related to the economic outlook credit terms and conditions i e the actual conditions laid down in the loan contract for new loans to enterprises and housing loans remained broadly unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2019 loan demand from enterprises decreased for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2013 reflecting the slowdown in economic activity observed since 2018 with financing needs for fixed investment ceasing to make a positive contribution to loan demand while the general low level of interest rates continued to support loan demand from firms and households euro area banks also indicated that their access to debt securities funding and securitisation continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2019 at the same time they highlighted a continued strengthening of their capital position against the backdrop of regulatory or supervisory actions in the second half of 2019 and a small tightening of their credit standards for loans to enterprises and consumer credit on account of non performing loan ratios furthermore banks indicated their intention to use tltro iii liquidity to a large extent for granting loans to the non financial private sector very favourable lending rates continued to support euro area economic growth lending rates remained close to their historical lows having declined in line with market reference rates over previous months in november 2019 the composite bank lending rates for loans to nfcs and households remained broadly unchanged at 1 55 and 1 47 respectively see chart 12 competitive pressures and more favourable bank funding costs dampened lending rates for loans to nfcs and households overall composite bank lending rates for loans to nfcs and households have fallen significantly since the ecb s

articles household wealth and consumption in the euro area prepared by gabe de bondt arne gieseck and mika tujula household wealth is the difference between the value of a household s assets and the value of its liabilities and is one of the key determinants of private consumption increases in wealth can affect private consumption in the short run as households may feel richer and become more confident moreover the level of household wealth is an important factor driving longer term consumption choices and growth together with future expected labour income it determines the level of life long resources available to households as private consumption is by far the largest contributor to total economic activity household wealth may have a substantial impact on the state of the economy and ultimately on the outlook for inflation in turn monetary policy may have an impact on wealth developments not only via its impact on asset prices but also through transmission channels therefore it is important to consider levels of and changes in wealth when determining the appropriate monetary policy stance assessing bank lending to corporates in the euro area since 2014 prepared by ramón

argentine peso the dairy division argentina will continue to adapt to changing economic conditions the dairy division australia continues to proceed with the integration of the specialty cheese business acquisition which adds to and complements its current activities as a result of the decrease in milk production in australia the dairy division australia expects increased competition in the sourcing of raw milk to persist and to continue to put pressure on margins as such the division is implementing alternate measures to mitigate these factors it will also continue to review operations to optimize the network at its disposal and benefit from its manufacturing flexibility the company aims to further capture opportunities derived from the operational combination of murray goulburn and warrnambool cheese and butter under a single platform and from the wide portfolio of australian brands inherited through the specialty cheese business acquisition at this time the impact of the australian bushfires on the company s operations has been limited and its facilities are operating as usual saputo has been able to collect close to all the milk from farmers and continues to work on a variety of ongoing practical support initiatives for those suppliers that are affected the company has confirmed its support to disaster relief efforts through financial and product donations and has supported employee initiatives to raise additional funds and volunteer for the first half of fiscal 2021 the company expects prices to remain relatively stable in the cheese and dairy ingredient markets as there is a better equilibrium between supply and demand in the international market europe sector for the remainder of fiscal 2020 the company will continue its integration of the dairy division uk and focus on aligning processes systems and sharing best practices the division will pursue capital investments in its manufacturing facilities with the objective of increasing its cheesemaking capabilities and driving overall growth at present the dairy division uk is a uk focused business with a predominantly local supply chain and customer base which mitigates the division s exposure to risks surrounding brexit enterprise resource planning erp program the company will continue planning designing and implementing activities for the migration to the new erp system in the first half of calendar 2020 the company will start the deployment of the erp program in the remainder of the dairy division australia to ensure its alignment under a single system and begin the subsequent phases of the implementation within the cheese division usa having recently completed the first phase the dairy division canada implementation will begin during calendar 2021 the dairy division uk is not currently in the scope of saputo s global erp program and its business will continue to operate under its existing erp system trade agreements the company expects to continue making an effective use of its interim quota allocation under the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp and intends to focus on importing dairy products that complement the current canadian product offering provided final allocations of dairy import licences are handled in a manner similar to the initial allocation the company does not foresee the cptpp having significant impacts on its operations and will seek to take advantage of export opportunities arising from australia and canada to other signatory countries the north american free trade agreement will remain in force until the new canada united states mexico agreement cusma is ratified by all three signatory countries at this stage canada is the only country that has yet to complete this step the company does not foresee significant impacts on its operations upon formal adoption of the cusma assuming the bulk of the import licences is allocated to dairy processors in canada finally the goal remains to continue to improve overall efficiencies in all sectors pursue growth organically and through acquisitions and always strive to be a stronger and better operator information by sector

originally published january 30 2020 we don t know what will trigger the crisis but a likely candidate is foreign selling of us dollars combining with a collapse in the us government s finances perhaps the coronavirus will turn out to be a black swan event but the underlying conditions for an economic and monetary crisis already exist this article looks at alternative outcomes it concludes that the current situation bears a worrying resemblance to the collapse of john law s mississippi scheme exactly 300 years ago the key to understanding why this is so is because of the link forged between asset prices and fiat currencies one fails and they both fail more rapidly than the most bearish bear might expect introduction ahead of a financial event it is a matter for educated guesswork to anticipate its course in the last few weeks increasing signs of a global recession have been observed telling us that the credit cycle is on the turn and a systemic crisis is due shortly adding to our woes the coronavirus might turn out to be a plague of biblical proportions at least that is the way the hype is going if so the economic damage will be immense a prescient analyst might deduce that one of the following outcomes is therefore likely 1 the playbook outcome a few banks get into trouble and are successfully rescued bankers become cautious in their lending and seek to withdraw loan facilities from riskier customers a moderate recession ensues unemployment rises the inflation rate declines and central banks respond by easing monetary policy in time the economy steadies and begins to recover this is the neo keynesian expectation of economists and monetary planners employed by central banks their government masters and the version currently believed in financial markets 2 a systemic breakdown in this version banking problems are just the start of it after the first few banks collapse and are rescued banking problems appear elsewhere and it is clear the global economy is in deep trouble in the authorities attempts to keep control over the situation the expansion of base money is on a far larger scale than that witnessed following the lehman crisis both to fund burgeoning government deficits and to build bank reserves after a protracted period of time the global economy stabilises and the immediate threat is over at some cost to the credibility and purchasing power of currencies a currency reset might be used in an attempt to stabilise the situation 3 a total collapse a systemic breakdown leads initially to lower interest rates already in progress and after a brief pause to a vicious bond bear market undermining financial asset values upon which the whole fiat money edifice is based the unbacked nature of modern fiat money then comes into play the principal consideration being that the collapse in bank collateral values exposes the illiquidity and bankruptcy of businesses and individuals alike tax income evaporates along with all credibility in the government s unbacked money which eventually becomes worthless in an attempt to divine the most likely outcome we must assess the importance of the moving parts and their likely sequencing cyclical considerations it is a mistake to regard the ending of the current credit cycle in isolation from previous cycles in the distant past it was valid to view the expansion of bank credit and its subsequent contraction as a purely cyclical phenomenon whereby excessive expansion is broadly wiped out by the subsequent contraction but ever since president hoover s tenure successive american governments and their central banks have attempted to contain the effects of bank credit contraction consequently failures have been increasingly institutionalised the piling up of failures has required further evils to maintain them governments have taken increasing control over free markets regulation has severely restricted competition in all but the newest of industries which in turn become regulated over time consumers have been encouraged to spend their savings and go into debt to increase immediate consumption trade barriers rightly seen as contributing to the 1930s depression have been preserved and protectionism is now weaponised budget deficits being twinned with trade deficits in savings free economies have also been increasing notably for america under president trump the american government is in a debt trap only alleviated by the fed s forced suppression of borrowing costs increasingly government funding is by overtly inflationary means the evidence and consequences of inflationary financing have been hidden from the general public because statistics particularly price inflation estimates have been suppressed this has allowed governments to fund themselves by expanding money quantities without apparent consequences for the general level of prices and at the same time to give the illusion that real gdp is positive when properly adjusted for price inflation it would be negative with successive cycles not being permitted to clear bad and unproductive debt the dollar has gone from 20 77 per ounce since president hoover s time to nearly 1600 today relative to gold that is a loss of purchasing power for the us dollar of nearly 99 over the whole epoch of non clearing credit cycles with increasing quantities of non productive debt in the global economy it is plainly naã ve to think it is a process that will continue indefinitely when the odds favouring a grand crisis undermining the whole fiat money system are increasing over time diligent students of history will have recognised that economic and monetary systems under the control of governments have always failed eventually there is no reason why this one will be different the question is not if but when monetary debasement at the core of the government illusion of control is money over successive credit cycles its expansion has reflected a ratchet effect with an underlying rate of expansion being supplemented by alternate expansions and contractions of bank credit that was the case before the lehman crisis at that time the rescue of the banking system involved an unprecedented expansion of the money supply last year the fed s attempt at reducing its balance sheet was hastily abandoned when it became clear that all the post lehman liquidity had simply vanished the fifty year history of the money quantity is illustrated in figure 1 which is of the fiat money quantity a measure that includes bank reserves not in public circulation but is fiat money nonetheless the pre banking crisis fmq path had been growing at a long term average rate of 5 9 while the average rate of growth subsequent to it has been 9 6 despite the extra 5 6 trillion of money in the system arising from this divergence there are signs of severe liquidity stresses with the fed having to inject tens of billions of dollars daily into the banking system through repo operations this is reflected in the sharp upturn in fmq in recent months visible in the chart it should be noted that before lehman failed fmq was roughly one third of gdp today it is three quarters there is therefore a substantial quantity of money in the us economy surplus to normal requirements a factor which might be crucial to the dollar s future that notwithstanding the pressure is now on for a further increase in the acceleration of money creation with growth in fmq likely to rise well above 10 annualised instead of demands for money from the productive private sector it has been the us government and financial speculators who have demanded excess money in recent years the government deficit is now officially expected to increase to over a trillion dollars while according to us treasury tic data foreigners appear to be losing their appetite for buying more us treasuries the drain on wholesale liquidity imposed by the government s financing demands now combines with demands on liquidity from very large hedge funds they have provided artificial support for the dollar by gearing up their interest rate arbitrage positions whereby they are short of euros and yen with their negative rates and long of the dollar and short term us government treasury bills and bonds to capture yield differentials it is therefore becoming apparent that without further monetary expansion interest rates and government bond yields will rise with devastating consequences for the us government s finances the hedge funds would be forced by the banks to unwind their positions selling dollars and buying euros and yen for lack of available balance sheet reserves limited by basel iii rules the shortage of dollar liquidity would drive up overnight interest rates at a time when the federal reserve board would wish to reflate the economy consequently sub 10 annualised growth in broad money is no longer tenable without triggering a widespread government funding and financial crisis we now stand on the edge of an acceleration of monetary inflation leading in time to a significant fall in the dollar s purchasing power measured not against other currencies facing similar difficulties but against commodities and ultimately consumer goods and services financial asset values central to how a financial crisis develops is the progression of asset values since the development of the greenspan put in the 1980s it has been assumed that the fed would always put a floor under equity markets by lowering interest rates sufficiently to do so starting with the containment of the 1987 stock market crash increasing numbers of methods have been deployed including interest rate manipulation open market operations and quantitative easing changing the level of required reserves for commercial banks has also been an important monetary tool but is no longer an option due to overriding basel iii regulations for global systemically important banks this is why the fed removed the distinction between required and excess reserves a few years ago the principal method of monetary and asset price control remains reducing interest rates and through them bond yields thereby increasing the relative attraction of equities but with the zero bound there is a theoretical limit to reducing interest rates and dollar rates are already close to it as shown in figure 2 with the fed funds rate under two per cent and the market already beginning to discount further declines interest rate policy is unlikely to be sufficient to underwrite asset values in the next systemic and financial crisis for this reason many commentators think that negative rates for the dollar are increasingly likely that would not necessarily help stabilise the us economy as evidence from the eurozone s ecb attests furthermore by putting all commodities into permanent backwardation not only would the purchasing power of the dollar be badly undermined but so would those of the fiat currencies that take their cue from the dollar as a matter of fact even current fed funds rates fully discount a general time preference for goods meaning that interest rates are at zero in real terms or even negative already the only piece of the monetary puzzle missing is an appreciation by complacent investors of how close markets are to a currency cliff edge understanding how and why markets are on the brink of a significant erosion in the dollar s purchasing power is crucial because it defines the limit of how low interest rates can be pushed without triggering an immediate monetary crisis we already know that current levels of interest rate suppression require the effect on prices to be suppressed by statistical methods tip the relationship between fiat dollars and commodities just a little further and the result will almost certainly become catastrophic for the dollar and all other currencies that sail with her if the dollar suffers this fate then an initial dip in interest rates will be followed by a significant rise forced on a reluctant fed by global markets refusing to fund the us deficit and choosing to liquidate their dollar positions instead it would therefore appear that there are two opposing forces for investors in financial assets to consider currently there is a bullish hope that the current economic deterioration can be contained and an ongoing reduction in interest rates will help preserve asset values against that there is the threat of fed policy failing to improve economic prospects leading to us treasury yields rising as markets become aware that budget deficits are spiralling out of control to be financed entirely by monetary expansion muddying the waters is direct and indirect statist purchasing of equities by central banks and sovereign wealth funds effectively binding financial assets more tightly to fiat currencies how the road ends from the foregoing it should be clear that not only is there a financial and systemic crisis in the wings but it cannot be resolved by central banks using the tools available to them we can easily deduce that there will be the usual end of credit cycle systemic and financial problems likely to involve the rescue of one or more major banks furthermore the monetary debasement by central banks will be significantly greater than that following the lehman crisis not only because the scale of the banking problem is likely to involve far larger numbers but because of the impossible position the us government finds itself in with respect to its own finances the clichã following the lehman crisis was kicking the can down the road the end of that road is no longer over the hill or around a bend but is coming into view that being the case we can rule out the first of the three options in the introduction to this article the playbook outcome that leaves either a wider systemic breakdown or a total collapse the difference between them will require success in stemming the former from evolving into the latter there can be little doubt a wider systemic breakdown will lead to a fall in the purchasing powers of fiat currencies which will be impossible to conceal by statistical method at this juncture a political leader with a true understanding of the situation and how to resolve it will have the opportunity to do so because the alternative to not doing so will be far worse and obvious to the wider public but such a leader must have guts and be surrounded by others willing to take his lead it will require the abandonment of socialising money and markets denying responsibility for future welfare in all but the most needy cases and a return to sound money while things can change there does not appear to be a ghost of a chance that such a leader exists and that he or she would be able to carry his or her colleagues this leaves us with the last possible outcome a total collapse of the neo keynesian paradigm and its principal tool the fiat currency the likely sequencing is as follows after an initial easing of interest rates and fall in government bond yields which is already under way it becomes clear that the economy is in a far worse condition than previously thought the productive sector and those employed in it having been impoverished of their income and savings through monetary inflation economic recovery becomes wishful thinking followed by a realisation that government finances are deteriorating rapidly with savers gone and consumers maxed out the only means of financing budget deficits is by inflationary means the currency begins its decline in either of two ways foreigners sell it and refuse to help finance the budget deficit or domestic depositors decide to reduce their cash in their bank accounts and buy goods instead in the latter case the damage comes from the public dumping of the currency the effects of which heavily outweigh the apparent increase in demand from the rush out of money if the government is lucky its people continue to use the currency as money despite its purchasing power continuing to decline even at ten times its current rate of issue seigniorage still gives the government some income attempts to stabilise the currency such as by introducing price controls only make things worse these are the conditions that have allowed certain latin american countries to suffer high inflation rates for prolonged periods alternatively the currency is driven towards worthlessness we shall dismiss a comparison with venezuela or zimbabwe where corruption has been a major factor the german experience after the first world war is a better model when inflationary financing of government spending commenced before the war and led to the final collapse of the currency in november 1923 this suggests that a final collapse reflected in the destruction of fiat currencies will take several years to evolve but there are differences between the european hyperinflations of nearly a hundred years ago and the situation today in america and britain as well as in some eurozone countries the majority of bank deposits are not owed to individuals because consumer credit predominates with eighty per cent of employees in these countries typically living from paycheck to paycheck and credit card borrowing being the norm there is a greater weighting of institutional deposits in today s banking system than in the past in the case of the us dollar total checking and savings accounts of 12 15 trillion include about 4 trillion of foreign owned deposits through correspondent banks credit card issuers and other finance companies accumulate significant cash flows and therefore deposits financial speculators such as hedge funds in the interest arbitrage business also maintain significant balances as repo collateral in short deposit holder classifications are very different from those of yesteryear so their collective attitude to money is likely to be very different they are not in the business of spending it on goods and do not make relative value judgements in this basic sense they are more likely to be spooked by purely financial developments it leads us on to consider another possibility a john law bubble deflation and currency collapse as the model to examine law s financing model john law was a prototype keynesian who in 1716 obtained permission from the duc d orlã ans acting as regent for louis xv in his minority to establish the banque genã rale in paris s place de vendome as a private bank capitalised with discredited state debt as a basis for issuing banknotes he took in deposits of specie mostly gold and silver coins by september 1716 the bank had become so successful that it was driving other bankers out of business the relationship between the regent and law was based on law s plan to restore royal finances which were in considerable difficulties put crudely his plan was to profit from the inflation of his own notes in order to pay down the royal debts furthermore by introducing modern banking into a financially backward france the improvement in the economy from more effective monetary circulation in the form of his notes compared with clumsy coinage would also help restore the royal finances through higher tax revenues the use of law s banknotes to settle taxes ensured their circulation and specie continued to be deposited at banque royale in exchange for them in accordance with law s plans banque genã rale s balance sheet was rapidly inflating and beginning to dominate financial affairs in paris law took in more discredited state debt which promised to pay a doubtful 4 substituting it for his own notes paying an apparently more certain 4 and including a bonus kicker of claims on louisiana and the canadian fur trade in france s american colonies law s use of discredited state debt as the foundation for his affairs had similarities with the basic functioning of today s central banks issuing money through quantitative easing for government debt and it came to pass that in december 1718 banque generale became banque royale evolving from a private bank into the state s bank law now had a monopoly on france s money concurrently law had acquired all the rights to trade with france s american colonies which became the mississippi venture he capitalised it by the use of partly paid subscriptions which by giving quick and substantial profits to early subscribers ensured the mississippi shares got off to a strong start and he further used the banque royale s note issues to boost share prices even further and so a bubble was born but by late 1719 law found it increasingly difficult to sustain the bubble the best part of a billion livres had been created and spent in ramping the mississippi shares following his appointment as controller general in 1720 he decreed that his banknotes were to be the only permitted currency except for small transactions and all old coins were to be handed in or seized clearly he was plugging holes in an increasingly leaky vessel on february 22 1720 the mississippi company and the banque royale merged the king sold 100 000 shares at 9 000 livres and the shares of the merged entities subsequently began to sink by november that year they had fallen to 3 200 livres and many of them faced further unpaid calls in the last three months of 1720 there was no sterling price for french livres because law s notes had also collapsed in value along with the mississippi bubble today s similarities with the mississippi bubble there are important similarities developing today with the events in france almost exactly three hundred years ago the salient points being law implemented a similar inflation scheme to that proposed by keynes both had an initially favourable economic impact followed by a failure to sustain earlier promises having progressed through a number of credit cycles keynes s scheme is yet to fully collapse law used state debt as the foundation for his scheme as do today s central banks the difference is the public knew louis xv to be bankrupt today markets are yet to realise this fact about modern welfare driven economies supported by the state law used the powers given to him to manipulate asset values to support his scheme an objective now openly pursued by modern central banks and their allied sovereign wealth funds in banque royale law established a prototype central bank whose twin objectives were to finance government borrowing and to issue currency the support offered to today s commercial banking system by central banks is ultimately intended to achieve the same end law banished the circulation of specie as money and any other alternatives to his own banknotes today s central banks exercise exactly the same monopolies in their respective jurisdiction law was an early user of derivatives in the form of partly paid stock and options to promote and sustain asset values the global financial system today similarly uses derivatives to support and encourage bullish speculation in financial assets by linking rising financial asset values to the purchasing power of his livre law ensured that the collapse of financial asset values undermined faith in the currency as well causing it to collapse entirely in a short six month period today both central banks and sovereign wealth funds are active investors in bonds and equities with the effect of creating a similar linkage across government bonds equities and fiat currencies given different times and different methods there are dissimilarities between law s scheme and the way those of keynes are playing out but it is the similarities which should ring alarm bells critics of inflationary financing generally assume the end of a fiat currency is marked by the general public eventually discarding it the similarities between keynes s and law s schemes suggest a different outcome by tying in financial asset values to currencies if one fails the other will too a loss of confidence in one immediately undermines the other the sequencing is that a failure to sustain bond and equity prices occurs first followed by their collapse closely accompanied by the erosion of all faith in the currency with this framework we can propose a future for both financial markets and the dollar the fed in a similar role to banque royale continues with its attempts to manipulate us treasury bond prices higher and therefore equity markets as has been the situation the case since the greenspan put in february 1720 the king sold 100 000 shares for 9 000 livres each netting 900 000 000 livres it marked the top of law s bubble the question is who or what will ring the bell this time today we cannot see who outside the us banking system is going to buy ever larger quantities of us treasury stock because foreigners are stalling in their appetite and domestic savers hardly exist we should bear in mind ownership of foreign currencies is justified by trade volumes and evidence of declining international trade firmly points to the dollar being sold consequently the banks acting as agents for the fed are going to be the only buyers being paid by the fed through crediting their reserves at the last count foreigners and their governments owned 19 4 trillion in us securities and had about 4 trillion in bank deposits the bubble will surely burst when the dollar begins to decline against other currencies creating doubled losses for foreign investors and a funding crisis for us government debt with us treasury bond yields then rising the dollar seems certain to accelerate its decline due to mounting portfolio losses faced by foreign investors that perhaps is where the similarity with the ending of law s scheme exists today a combination of circumstances based on an official tie between financial assets and the fiat currency like the collapse of law s scheme we can expect it to be measured in the soaring price of specie physical gold and silver and today perhaps decentralised issue limited cryptocurrencies this being the case the collapse will not be drawn out as even the most bearish bears expect but could be completed by the end of this year original post editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors

by on tuesday february 4 2020 donald trump delivered a state of the union speech that revealed his election 2020 strategy designed to roil and mobilize his political base and to declare to the democrats that his political war with them will now escalate further if anyone thinks the recent impeachment and senate trial was the high point of the growing conflict between the two political parties republican correct that trumpublicans now and democrat they haven t seen anything yet the worse much worse is yet to come in the months leading up to the november 2020 elections the visual personification of this intensifying conflict was evident during trump s speech as he began speaking trump turned to vice president pence and house of representatives leader pelosi both sitting behind him on a dais trump handed them his written speech as is the tradition he then abruptly turned away from pelosi refusing to shake her extended hand as traditional decorum has always required pelosi shocked by the snub after trump finished in turn symbolically tore up the written speech all this was caught on national tv the event was symbolic of the fight will now escalate and get even more vicious in the run up to november if trump s speech summarized the conflict up to this point the exchange between him and pelosi reflected the gloves off political conflict now about to begin as the saying goes we ain t seen nothing yet it is not difficult to understand the true meaning of trump s sotu above all it represents a toss of red meat to his radical political base there was very little in it about what he proposes for the country in the future as is normal for a sotu speech instead what we got was a speech designed to agitate and mobilize his political base based on themes of fear of the immigrant and hate of pelosi and the democrats the dish of fear hate was sauteed with a large dose of lies and misrepresentations and served up with a new recipe of racism designed to help trump hold on to the swing states that delivered his electoral college majority in 2016 the speech marks what will be a significant escalation of extraordinary political attacks by trump and his movement against his democrat opponents in the election and if past practice is any clue the democrat leadership is likely unprepared for what is to come the red meat to the base the speech was replete with what trump s base wants to hear with no punches pulled once again as in 2016 the immigrant is the dangerous criminal and killer the immigrant is of course anyone of color but especially latinos crossing the southern us border and anyone sympathetic in any way to them or even those already legally here trump wants to protect us from the immigrant and according to trump s appeal to this base the democrats want to embrace him protect him with taxpayer money and thereby identify themselves with the criminal killer element among us in the same breath as he reiterated his politically successful anti latino racist appeal trump touted his long tall and very powerful wall claiming 100 miles have already been built and another 500 coming next year more money for the wall will thus by inference be necessary or else we may all suffer the fate of the anecdotal killer criminal immigrant who of course is latino a variation on this illegal read latino enemy within us theme is the sanctuary cities movement and by association the entire state of california which has declared itself a sanctuary state trump spent a good deal of time in his speech attacking sanctuary cities in the past his bete noir was a person hillary pelosi etc now it s a geography even a state watch out california trump is about to swing his ax far and wide and in your direction like most demagogues trump likes to make his case with anecdotal emotional appeals thus with a fear mongering melodramatic anecdotal example early in his speech he cited a criminal illegal running amuck shooting everyone in california that cleared the way for his proposal for legislation to go after sanctuary cities in particular in california the legislation proposed was the justice for victims of sanctuary cities act that would allow individuals to sue sanctuary cities it is clearly a move to open the door for radical elements of his base to protest and engage in even more militant perhaps even violent action not unlike how anti abortion radicals were encouraged in the past to physically attack abortion clinics and threaten and assault doctors and nurses like all extreme nationalist and proto fascist movements there must be an enemy within that is identified as the source of the country s problems including those who might defend them another red meat toss to his base in his speech was his proposal for legislation to bar late term abortions still another dish offered up was allowing prayer in public schools which he followed up with a pledge to increase federal funding to promote it another fresh bone thrown to the base was trump s strong endorsement of 2nd amendment gun rights in contrast throughout the speech not a word was said about mass killings at us schools or the fact that studies show a shooting and killing goes on in schools in america at least once every day somewhere his base was no doubt pleased as well with his solution to the growing climate crisis somehow business and the public will plant 1 trillion more trees he proposed that would presumably create enough oxygen to prevent the oceans from acidifying glaciers from melting and australia and california from burning there was also an attack on public schools trump claimed they were failing everywhere and that every parent should have the choice of sending their kid to whatever school they wanted and receive scholarship money paid by the taxpayer to send them to a private school of their choice trump touted the educational freedom scholarship act in one of at least a half dozen examples best described as gallery melodrama he turned to the gallery in the house chamber and introduced a young black girl and her mother announcing on the spot he personally was giving her a scholarship under the act one of the more disgusting examples of gallery melodrama that has become ready fare apparently in these sotu speeches in recent years was trump s introduction of the right wing radical talk show pundit rush limbaugh long an ideologue of the radical extreme right who has dished up lies and misrepresentations on a daily basis limbaugh was introduced as having stage 4 lung cancer that was to set up the sympathy appeal of course trump then announced he was giving rush the presidential medal of freedom rush acted surprised the person next to rush then immediately pulled out the medal and draped it around limbaugh s neck we re supposed to believe it was all unrehearsed and spontaneous not a dry eye in the gallery trump s message all you liars and hate mongers on the right out there you too can become a hero under trump just keep up the good work in the coming election year the new racism card democrats should take note of trump s new racism strategy he clearly is now appealing to the african american voter even as he writes off and declares the latino as the illegal alien threat in at least six episodes of gallery melodrama trump s subject was a black american in addition to the young girl and her mother noted above trump introduced a black former drug user who became a businessman enabled by trump s opportunity zone legislation in fact a piece of legislation designed to give special tax cuts to businesses in certain cities then there was the black kid who wants to become an astronaut he was introduced with his 100 year old grandfather a former air force officer charles mcgee who served in korea and vietnam next to him trump announced he just made mcgee a brigadier general that kills three birds with one stone as they say a kudo to senior citizens to blacks and to the military all in one melodrama bundle trump then proposed an increase in funding for black colleges in only one and very brief gallery melodrama episode during the speech was a latino introduced unlike all the black kids and moms he was a latino ice officer not as much emotional sympathy appeal there see where this is going up with blacks down with latinos split the minority vote why the strange pro black strategy a strategy launched by the way a few days earlier in his unprecedented election ad in the super bowl where trump took credit for the bipartisan criminal reform legislation just passed by showing a middle aged black women crying in relief now that trump had released her relative from prison trump now a defender of african americans a reformed former racist trump the declarer that africans lived in shithole countries it s not that trump has overnight given up his racist attitude against african americans what he s doing is counting the electoral votes in the swing states the new appeal to blacks is designed to provide him a margin of extra votes in those swing states a safer margin in the red states especially the south in places like georgia all to ensure he wins the electoral college votes in those states as he did in 2016 that black vote margin is needed to offset the possible loss of middle class white women in the swing states that are according to polls put off by trump s aggressive and off the cuff tweets and statements manipulate blacks mobilize white nationalists by vilifying latinos and other peoples of color split the minority vote in other words trump s lies by commission as heard so often from trump much of his sotu speech was laden with outright lies in the roughly one third of it devoted to the economy this was especially the case another one third of the speech was devoted to domestic issues and another third to foreign policy first there was trump s claim that the under him the us economy is the best it has ever been in us history but what are the facts not so in terms of us gdp trump s roughly 2 growth rate today is not that much different from the average since 2000 nevertheless he said families are flourishing oh what about the more than half of families today who have less than 400 to their name for emergencies or the more than half in each of the last two years who say in polls they received no wage increase at all in either year or what about the tens of millions of millennials and youth indentured with 1 6 trillion in student debt and can t get homes or families even started in the speech trump claimed the unemployment rate was the lowest ever but that s the so called u 3 rate which covers only full time workers whose employment ranks by the way have been declining in absolute terms it further excludes altogether the roughly 60 million us part time gig and temp workers if they were accurately estimated and included in unemployment figures the true unemployment rate would be 8 10 and what about wages in the speech trump repeated the oft heard statistic that wages have been rising on his watch but behind that figure lay several deeper facts first there s the more than half of the labor force who acknowledge they received no wage increase at all last year or the year before that suggests it is the top 10 of tech professional and other workers who are getting most of the wage gains moreover the wage figures and gains noted by trump are an average if those at the top get more those at the middle and below are getting less or even nothing in addition the numbers are for full time workers leaving out the 60 million part time and temps finally they re wages not adjusted for inflation the real picture is that unemployment is much higher and wages are stagnating for the vast majority or worse but this didn t stop trump in his sotu speech from saying companies are coming back to the us and creating jobs or that this is a blue collar boom with wages rising trump also declared in his sotu that he would protect social security and medicare but in his recent speech to the billionaire crowd in davos switzerland he let it slip to the well heeled in attendance he would be going after both once he won the election again one wonders which audience he s speaking the truth of his real intentions to in the sotu he also gave support to infrastructure spending but his prior proposals define infrastructure investment as tax cuts for real estate developers he also declared in the sotu speech that his recent proposals would lower prescription drug prices but by this he really meant consumers being gouged by the pharma companies would get to see how much the various drugs were being raised in order to choose which one that would gouge them less market transparency does not mean lower drug prices big pharma is not a competitive market where the consumer can choose among multiple offerings an even more outrageous blatant lie was trump s declaration he was giving his ironclad guarantee that those with health related pre existing conditions would have access to health care when in fact what he has proposed to date are various measures to roll back pre existing conditions guarantees trump s most ridiculous lie was that medicare was socialist here he was obviously attacking the growing support for a medicare for all solution to the health crisis increasingly supported both by the public and within the ranks of the democrats as he put it 180 million americans love their private health insurance and he promised not to let the socialists take that away even though it s quite clear that 70 of the us population is now dissatisfied with private health insurance and want something better and if medicare is socialist does that mean the 50 million seniors on medicare and social security are socialists as well add the millennials and seniors and america must have already gone socialist one of the more disgusting outright lying claims of trump was his comment that under his regime 7 million on food stamps had left the program but what he didn t mention was he and the republicans just declared 700 000 no longer eligible for food stamp support including single moms with kids trump s sotu lying by omission lies may be committed by carefully not elaborating on topics here trump excelled as well in his sotu speech for example he boasted that the stock markets had risen in value by 12 trillion on his watch but what he didn t say is that more than 1 trillion every year has been passed on by corporations to investors and stock holders in the form of stock buybacks and dividend payouts that s what drove the 12 trillion making the 2 of the voters who own most of the stock richer than ever in history he then glossed over the recent signed china us phase 1 trade deal as well as the nafta 2 0 usmca trade deal he said they were great achievements but refused to indicate in what sense in recent weeks he has declared china would buy 100 billion more in us goods this year as part of that deal but the fact is china never agreed to that and most economists estimate it will be well less than 50b and maybe not even that now that the coronavirus is undermining us china trade and so far as the usmca is concerned trump in the sotu speech reported it will produce 100 000 new us jobs but even a cursory reading of the terms of that deal show there are no measures designed to bring back jobs from mexico to the us in both the trade deals there s really no there there as economists are now beginning to determine both the china and usmca trade deals are just old wine in new bottles as they say corked up with a lot of bombast hyperbole and factual misrepresentation missing totally from the sotu speech was any reference how trump s multi trillion dollar tax cuts for corporations and investors and war spending have driven the us budget deficit in excess of 1 trillion a year with trillion dollar additional deficits for another decade in short unlike all republican presidents before him in his sotu speech trump said nothing about the accelerating deficit and in turn the 23 trillion national debt or how he proposed to address it in the coming year or beyond in yet another example of lying by omission in the speech trump claimed that low wage workers had experienced an increase of 16 in wages on his watch but then didn t bother to explain that most of that was due to the raising of minimum wages by governors and legislatures in the blue democratic states lying by omission means taking credit for things you never did or were done by others that s become a norm for trump and he kept up that practice throughout the sotu speech foreign policy fantasies trump has had no actual foreign policy accomplishment during his entire term in office nothing came of the north korea deal he was able to get only a few token european countries like greece to increase their nato spending a little but not much his attempted support for a coup in venezuela collapsed that didn t stop him by bringing to his speech the us selected puppet guaido and introducing him in the gallery his trade deals produced very little in actual gains for the us ballooning trade deficit he achieved nothing in syria or turkey except to allow russia to increase its influence in both and he failed to get iran to the bargaining table to renegotiate the nuclear deal what he did declare in his sotu speech as victories in foreign policy was his reversal of the obama administration s opening to cuba his recent launch a new mideast israel palestine initiative that was dead on arrival the claim he destroyed isis when in fact it was mostly the iranians kurds russians and turks that did it and his declaration that peace talks in afghanistan to end that conflict were making tremendous progress when in fact a deal isn t even close and not least his assassination of the iranian general soleimani that almost pushed both countries over the brink of war not much there in foreign policy either the sotu message domestic political warfare where trump has succeeded is in his domestic political war with the democrats as he noted in the sotu speech he has approved 187 new federal court judges and two supreme court judges giving him a clear majority in the judiciary the us senate has become no less myopically committed to him than his political grassroots base and media machine senate leader mcconnell has proven to be one of the most obsequious senate leaders in history with the judiciary and one house of congress firmly in his pocket now he has not been reluctant to break whatever rules and norms he deems necessary having outmaneuvered the democrats in the mueller report and russia interference affair and now as well in the impeachment attempt trump is now even more confident no doubt that he can run roughshod over pelosi and the democrats in this election year and he will his sotu speech was in effect a declaration of his intent to do so and the confrontation at the end of the speech between himself and pelosi trump refusing to shake her extended hand and pelosi then ripping up his speech is symbolic of the political dogfight about to come throughout it all trump s approval rating has survived in safe territory his red state allies are intent on ensuring his electoral vote majority via both gerrymandering and voter roll suppression his grass roots minions are itching to release more aggressive protests demonstrations and action his strategists are formulating a new racist appeal to split democrats historical minority base of support meanwhile the democrats themselves are sliding into their own internal conflict with the corporate wing planning to scuttle sanders by any means necessary and replace him with bloomberg as their candidate at the convention in short trump s sotu speech was less about the state of the union and more about the state of trump s re election and the trump strategy to win a second term in november and it appears he may succeed in domestic politics while having clearly failed in economics and foreign policy

when she first became indonesia s finance minister in 2005 sri mulyani indrawati sacked 150 of her departmental staff for corruption and penalised another 2 000 if you are corrupt you are going to have to deal with me i am not going to let you work here and i will put you in prison sri mulyani indrawati despite being the fourth most populous country in the world indonesia plays a relatively small role on the geopolitical stage rarely do its cabinet ministers garner any form of international recognition however there is one minister whose reputation precedes her sri mulyani indrawati finance minister of indonesia is highly respected at home and abroad as well as being named the world s best finance minister in 2006 by euromoney she regularly features on forbes annual rankings of the world s most powerful women and her popularity shows no signs of waning when she was reappointed for president joko jokowi widodo s second term in 2019 the indonesian rupiah strengthened by 0 6 percent investors appear to trust that she can run a tight ship nicholas antonio mapa senior economist at ing told world finance after all it takes nerves of steel to champion economic reform with as much commitment as sri mulyani particularly when reform means undoing decades of corruption honest achievements sri mulyani is known for her no nonsense approach when she first became finance minister under president susilo bambang yudhoyono in 2005 she sacked 150 of her departmental staff for corruption and penalised another 2 000 if you are corrupt you are going to have to deal with me she said in an interview in 2009 i am not going to let you work here and i will put you in prison that s going to be my policy many saw sri mulyani indrawati s resignation as an indication that indonesia was turning back the clock on much needed economic and political reform this hostility towards those who cheat the system was instilled in sri mulyani from an early age for most of her young life indonesia was ruled by one of the most dishonest autocrats of all time president suharto through his system of patronage the dictator s family members and close associates dominated the economy sri mulyani s first experience of this cronyism came while she was studying at the university of indonesia where the president s daughter siti hediati hariyadi was also enrolled already sri mulyani could see that the entourage of the president s daughter would be fast tracked into high flying business roles and cabinet positions that were out of reach for her fellow students that feeling of exclusion was very strong she told bloomberg in 2017 if you re not a friend of those people then your career path is going to be very different and that is exactly what influences very strongly the way i think about economics and the economy in indonesia born to academics sri mulyani s upbringing was modest she had nine siblings and her mother worked a second job to make ends meet her parents impressed upon her the value of education and at university she excelled earning a scholarship that allowed her to go on to pursue a doctorate in economics at the university of illinois after graduating she returned to her alma mater it was then while sri mulyani was working as a lecturer that the country underwent radical change the 1997 asian financial crisis saw the devaluations of many east asian currencies including indonesia s rupiah across the country there were widespread layoffs and bankruptcies as anger towards the ruling class mounted president suharto who had ruled for more than 30 years was deposed during this tumultuous period and in the years of uncertainty that followed sri mulyani became more incensed by what she saw as the wrong policy the wrong approach being executed by indonesia s politicians compelled to make a difference she began looking for career opportunities beyond academia she worked on strengthening local government institutions through the us agency for international development and then became an executive director at the international monetary fund where she represented 12 countries in south east asia before being appointed head of the indonesian national development planning agency these positions focused mainly on development preparing her for her most challenging role yet managing south east asia s largest economy as it recovered from crisis enemies in high places analysts estimate that president suharto stole as much as 35bn from indonesia before he was deposed since his resignation the country has changed dramatically the indonesia of 2019 is almost unrecognisable from 1999 said tom pepinsky non resident senior fellow at the brookings institution not only has the country overseen a successful democratic transition but it has also recovered from a massive economic crisis the country has enjoyed two decades now of consistent economic growth and politics has become far more open and plural than it was under suharto s authoritarian new order regime sri mulyani s economic reforms were key in shaping indonesia during this period after becoming finance minister in 2005 she tackled corruption head on and pushed hard to raise tax revenue and slash private and public debt by 2009 the nation s debts had been reduced to 30 percent of overall gdp down from over 100 percent a decade prior sri mulyani indrawati in numbers 2005 first appointed as indonesian finance minister 2016 returned to finance minister role 700m cost to bail out century bank 90 salary cut to leave the world bank suharto s legacy of patronage and bribery was so entrenched within the system that sri mulyani had to fight hard to keep it out of her ranks in this respect she was ruthless when the government s human resources department was accused of manipulating the rotation for promotions sri mulyani sought to fire the person responsible but there was no way to work out exactly who it was so sri mulyani told the director general to replace all 60 employees in that cohort overkill is necessary and important to get the message across she said about the decision not everyone took kindly to her tough reforms one of many powerful enemies she made was aburizal bakrie a member of indonesia s elite and chair of the suharto era golkar party one of his family s companies bumi resources was hit hard by sri mulyani s tax crackdown she also resisted pressure from bakrie to prop up his coal interests with government funds like others in indonesia s old guard bakrie became determined to undermine her reform agenda the wheels were set in motion for sri mulyani s resignation when she made the controversial decision to bail out century bank for 700m it was not long after the 2008 financial crisis and sri mulyani feared that the failing institution could be a contagion for the rest of the financial sector but critics accused her of acting without legal authority bakrie s golkar party seized the opportunity and backed a parliamentary inquiry into the bailout although sri mulyani denied any criminal wrongdoing her reputation in indonesia suffered a significant blow as a result of the investigation it didn t help that president yudhoyono was quiet on the subject for months eventually he came to her aid commending her credibility and personal integrity but it was too little too late the investigation was enough to convince sri mulyani that her battle against corruption had come to an end a day after testifying she announced her resignation return to the charge around the world many saw sri mulyani s resignation as an indication that indonesia was turning back the clock on much needed economic and political reform the indonesia stock exchange tumbled 3 8 percent after her departure was announced but sri mulyani was not on the back foot for long in june 2010 she became one of the three managing directors at the world bank with her experience as a reformist proving highly valuable for this career defining role the regions she was responsible for the middle east and north africa had endured the same corruption that sri mulyani tried to stamp out in indonesia and she championed reform in energy health and education during her tenure she helped pull in significant donations for some of the world s poorest regions and rose to second in command within the organisation earning respect from peers around the globe it came as a huge shock when six years later jokowi asked her to join his cabinet she was on a three day visit to the university of indonesia when the president offered her the finance minister position it was no easy decision for one thing it meant taking a bruising 90 percent salary cut ultimately sri mulyani s sense of duty got the better of her if a president who was elected by the people asked you to join him to realise indonesia s ambition i don t think anyone can say no to that she told the south china morning post sri mulyani was tasked with helping jokowi find funds for his major road rail and port infrastructure projects she immediately put raising tax revenues at the top of the agenda with this tax amnesty programme sri mulyani hoped to boost tax revenues by as much as idr 165trn 11 7bn in the first year at the time indonesia had one of the lowest tax collection rates in south east asia with just 900 000 indonesians submitting returns in 2014 sri mulyani was keen to show that she d lost none of her fire for economic reform in her first interview as finance minister under jokowi she warned tax evaders that they had to choose between heaven and hell and either accept a two percent tax penalty and have their sins deleted or suffer the consequences i m not going to play around she added indonesia s tough reformist was back in town room for improvement now that she s been reappointed for jokowi s second term the world is waiting to see whether sri mulyani can lift the economy out of stagnation jokowi sailed to victory on promises that he would transform the economy and achieve seven percent annual growth but since coming to power in 2014 growth has remained sluggish at five percent indonesia has churned out robust growth figures over the past few quarters even in the face of several fed rate hikes as well as concerns about the global economy mapa told world finance but five percent for the region s largest economy doesn t point to the economy hitting its potential so far the administration has struggled to attract the foreign investment it hoped for the us china trade war should have been a great opportunity for indonesia as companies looked to relocate their manufacturing bases to avoid being hit by us tariffs but of the 33 companies that announced plans to move operations out of china between june 2018 and august 2019 23 chose vietnam as their new base none chose indonesia one of the main reasons investors have cold feet is the vast amount of red tape that surrounds indonesian business causing significant delays at the same time poor road and rail connections can be a major deterrent for foreign companies jokowi further development of the country s infrastructure and as the country starts to lay out the details of the plan to move the capital from jakarta to the eastern part of indonesian borneo development financing will be a major priority pepinsky told world finance sri mulyani must now try to boost growth within a very tight budget despite her impressive credentials executing the president s ambitious vision for the economy will be a gruelling task but no one is better suited for the job than indonesia s iron lady curriculum vitae born 1962 education university of indonesia 1998 sri mulyani indrawati became a lecturer in economics at the university of indonesia her alma mater and was later appointed as visiting professor at the andrew young school of policy studies at georgia state university 2002 inspired to take a more active role in economic development sri mulyani joined the board of the international monetary fund as executive director representing 12 countries in south east asia 2005 president susilo bambang yudhoyono selected sri mulyani as indonesia s finance minister she was credited with strengthening indonesia s economy and safeguarding it against the 2008 financial crisis 2010 after making the controversial decision to bail out century bank a failing financial institution sri mulyani resigned as finance minister and became a managing director at the world bank 2016 sri mulyani made her return to indonesia s cabinet as finance minister under president joko jokowi widodo who tasked her with securing financing for his ambitious infrastructure plans and attracting foreign investment 2019 when news came that sri mulyani had been reappointed as finance minister for jokowi s second term in office it caused the rupiah to strengthen by 0 6 percent its highest value in more than a month
while u s advocates and local politicians struggle to get their first public banks chartered mexico s new president has begun construction on 2 700 branches of a government owned bank to be completed in 2021 when it will be the largest bank in the country at a press conference on jan 6 he said the neoliberal model had failed private banks were not serving the poor and people outside the cities so the government had to step in andrés manuel lópez obrador known as amlo has been compared to the united kingdom s left wing opposition leader jeremy corbyn with one notable difference amlo is now in power he and his left wing coalition won by a landslide in mexico s 2018 general election overturning the institutional revolutionary party pri that had ruled the country for much of the past century called mexico s first full fledged left wing experiment amlo s election marks a dramatic change in the political direction of the country amlo wrote in his 2018 book a new hope for mexico in mexico the governing class constitutes a gang of plunderers mexico will not grow strong if our public institutions remain at the service of the wealthy elites the new president has held to his campaign promises in 2019 his first year in office he did what donald trump pledged to do drain the swamp purging the government of technocrats and institutions he considered corrupt profligate or impeding the transformation of mexico after 36 years of failed market focused neoliberal policies other accomplishments have included substantially increasing the minimum wage while cutting top government salaries and oversize pensions making small loans and grants directly to farmers guaranteeing crop prices for key agricultural crops launching programs to benefit youth the disabled and the elderly and initiating a 44 billion infrastructure plan lópez obrador s goal he says is to construct a new paradigm in economic policy that improves human welfare not just increases gross domestic product the end of the neoliberal era to deliver on that promise in july 2019 amlo converted the publicly owned federal savings bank bansefi into a bank of the poor banco del bienestar or welfare bank he said on jan 6 that the neoliberal era had eliminated all the state owned banks but one which he had gotten approval to expand with 2 700 new branches added to the existing 538 branches of the former bansefi that will bring the total in two years to 3 238 branches far outstripping any other bank in the country banco azteca currently the largest by number of branches has 1 860 digital banking will also be developed speaking to a local group in december amlo said his goal was for the bank of the poor to reach 13 000 branches more than all the private banks in the country combined at a news conference on jan 8 he explained why this new bank was needed there are more than 1 000 municipalities that don t have a bank branch we re dispersing resources but we don t have a way to do it people have to go to branches that are two three hours away if we don t bring these services close to the people we re not going to bring development to the people they re already building i ll invite you within two months three at the most to the inauguration of the first branches because they re already working they re getting the land because we have to do it quickly the president said the 10 billion pesos 530 4 million needed to build the new branches would come from government savings and that 5 million had already been transferred to the banco del bienestar which would pass the funds to the secretariat of defense whose engineers were responsible for construction the military will also be used to transport physical funds to the branches for welfare payments amlo added they are helping me they are propping me up the military has behaved very well and they don t back down at all they always tell me yes you can yes we do go to concerns that the government owned bank would draw deposits away from commercial banks and might compete in other ways such as making interest free loans to small businesses amlo countered there s no reason to be complaining about us building these branches f private banks want to build branches they have every right to go to the towns and build their branches but as they won t because they believe that it s not business we have to do it it s our social responsibility the state can t shirk its social responsibility issues with the central bank while the legislature has approved the new bank mexico s central bank can still block it if bank regulations are breached ricardo delfín who works at the international accounting firm kpmg told the newspaper la razón that if the money to fund the bank comes from a loan from the federal government rather than from capital it will adversely affect the bank s capitalization ratio but amlo contends that the bank will be self sufficient funding for construction will come from federal savings from other programs and the bank s operating expenses will be covered by small commissions paid on each transaction by customers most of whom are welfare recipients branches will be built on land owned by the government or donated and software companies have offered to advise for free about the central bank he said we re going to speak with those from the bank of méxico respecting the autonomy of the bank of méxico we have to educate them because for them this is an anachronism even sacrilege because they have other ideas but we ve arrived here after telling the people that the neoliberal economic policy was going to change there shouldn t be obstacles how is the bank of méxico going to stop us from having a branch that disperses resources in favor of the people what damage does that do whom does it harm amlo has repeatedly promised not to interfere in the business of the central bank which has been autonomous for the past quarter of a century but he has also said that he would like its mandate expanded from just preserving the value of the peso by fighting inflation to include fostering growth the concern according to the financial times is that he might use the central bank to fund government programs following in the footsteps of argentina s former president cristina fernández de kirchner whose heterodox policies led to high inflation and many economists believe the country s current crisis mark weisbrot counters in the new york times however that argentina s problems were caused not by printing money to fund domestic development but by a massive foreign debt hyperinflation actually happened under fernández de kirchner s successor president mauricio macri who replaced her in 2015 the public debt grew from 53 to more than 86 of gdp inflation soared from 18 to 54 short term interest rates shot up to 75 and poverty increased from 27 to 40 in an upset election in august 2019 the outraged argentinian public re elected fernández de kirchner as vice president and her former head of the cabinet of ministers as president restoring the 12 year kirchner legacy begun by her husband nestor kirchner in 2003 and considered by weisbrot to be among the most successful presidencies in the western hemisphere more appropriate than argentina as a model for what can be achieved by a government working in partnership with its central bank is that of japan where prime minister shinzo abe has funded his stimulus programs by selling government bonds directly to the bank of japan the boj now holds nearly 50 of the government s debt yet consumer price inflation remains low so low that the boj cannot get the figure up even to its 2 target other funding options amlo is unlikely to go that route because he has vowed not to interfere with the central bank but analysts say he needs to introduce some sort of economic stimulus because mexico s gdp has slipped in the last year the mexican president has criticized gdp as the ultimate standard advocating instead for a model of development that incorporates wealth distribution and access to education health housing and culture into its measurements but as kurt hackbarth warned in jacobin in december to fully unfurl program without simply ransacking other line items to pay for it will require doing something amlo has up to now categorically ruled out raising taxes on the rich and large corporations which not surprisingly make out like utter bandits in mexico s rigged financial system amlo has continually vowed however not to raise taxes on the rich instead he has enlisted mexico s business magnates as investors in public private partnerships allowing him to avoid the tequila trap that brought down argentina and mexico itself in earlier years getting locked into debt to foreign investors and the international monetary fund mexico s business leaders seem happy to invest in the country despite some slippage in gdp as noted by carlos slim mexico s wealthiest man debt didn t go up there is no fiscal deficit and inflation came down in november 2019 the economy secretariat reported that foreign direct investment showed a 7 8 increase in the first nine months of that year compared with the same period in 2018 reaching its second highest level ever and at the end of 2019 the peso was up around 4 stocks also rose 4 5 and inflation dropped from 4 8 to 3 partnering with local businessleaders is politically expedient but public private partnerships can be expensive and as u k professor richard werner points out tapping up private investors merely recirculates existing money in the economy better would be to borrow directly from banks which create new bank money when they lend as the bank of england has confirmed this new money then circulates in the economy stimulating productivity today the best model for that approach is china which funds infrastructure by borrowing from its own state owned banks like all banks they create loans as bank credit on their books which is then repaid with the proceeds of the projects created with the loans there is no need to tap up the central bank or rich investors or the tax base government banks can create money on their books just as central banks and private banks do for mexico however using its public banks as china does would be something for the future if at all meanwhile amlo has been a trailblazer in

sucking the life out of thriving china if it is not controlled in a short period it could shatter the dream of china to become the world s largest economy presently its economy is trailing behind the usa only and is well poised to take the lead in its bid to grapple with the coronavirus on a war footing and eliminate it china may be compelled to cut down taxes increase expenditure and lower interest rates to offset the ill effects of the virus impact of coronavirus on china s economy production of electric cars and solar manufacturing by the us company tessa in shanghai has stopped

the closure of factories in the virus prone regions it is feared that unemployment in china which is currently at 4 5 would further fall down prices of food items are likely to soar economists foresee a drop of 2 in china s gdp resulting in a loss of 62 billion this heavy jolt could make china s flourishing economy anemic china s growth rate had slid down last year from over 11 to 6 1 and was the lowest in the last three decades it is likely to slip to 5 6 this year the reason was the us trade sanctions and tariffs on china s goods in 2018 19 trade war impelled multi national companies to shift from china to other countries such as vietnam to avoid us tariffs other reasons were increasing foreign debts owing to largescale development works in western china gigantic obor project and

release references to oil sands operations exclude suncor energy inc s suncor or the company interests in fort hills and syncrude calgary alberta feb 05 2020 globe newswire in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor generated funds from operations of 2 6 billion bringing annual funds from operations to a new record of 10 8 billion said mark little president and chief executive officer in 2019 we returned 4 9 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders representing 45 of our total funds from operations since the start of 2017 we have paid 7 1 billion in dividends and repurchased 6 7 billion of shares representing over 9 of our outstanding common shares demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns funds from operations were 2 553 billion 1 66 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the prior year quarter marking the tenth consecutive quarter above 2 billion cash flow provided by operating activities was 2 304 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3 040 billion in the prior year quarter as the prior year quarter included a source of cash in working capital associated with a declining price environment operating earnings were 782 million 0 51 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 580 million 0 36 per common share in the prior year quarter the company had a net loss of 2 335 billion 1 52 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to non cash asset impairment charges of 3 352 billion after tax primarily due to lower forecasted heavy oil prices for fort hills and higher capital cost estimates for the west white rose project compared to a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the prior year quarter in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor demonstrated its continued focus on value over volume as oil sands operations achieved synthetic crude oil sco production of 300 000 barrels per day bbls d and upgrader utilization of 86 compared to sco production of 273 400 bbls d and upgrader utilization of 79 in the prior year period with both periods impacted by maintenance total exploration and production e p production during the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to 115 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d from 90 200 boe d in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to higher production in east coast canada which increased to 69 600 bbls d from 47 900 bbls d in the prior year quarter reliable operations in refining and marketing drove refinery utilization of 97 and crude throughput of 447 500 bbls d suncor sanctioned the forty mile wind power project which is expected to drive value through sustainable low carbon power generation and the retention of generated carbon credits for utilization in suncor s upstream business subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 465 per share an increase of 11 the board also approved an increase to the company s existing share repurchase program from 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion through to the end of february 2020 and a further annual extension of the share repurchase program up to 2 0 billion beginning march 1 2020 demonstrating confidence in the company s ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to return cash to shareholders financial results operating earnings suncor s fourth quarter 2019 operating earnings were 782 million 0 51 per common share compared to 580 million 0 36 per common share in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily a result of improved western canadian crude oil differentials including a substantial narrowing of heavy crude and sco differentials which more than offset lower benchmark pricing from the prior year quarter this resulted in an increase in oil sands price realizations and a net favourable inventory valuation change partially offset by lower refining margins fourth quarter 2019 operating earnings were also positively impacted by increased production at east coast canada and oda operating earnings were unfavourably impacted by lower oil sands production compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to planned maintenance and the alberta government s mandatory production curtailments higher depreciation depletion and amortization dd a and royalties and lower refinery crude throughput net loss suncor s net loss was 2 335 billion 1 52 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors impacting operating earnings discussed above the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2019 included 3 352 billion of non cash after tax asset impairment charges partially offset by a 235 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt the net loss in the prior year quarter included an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 637 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a non cash impairment loss of 223 million after tax on one of the company s equity investments funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 553 billion 1 66 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were influenced primarily by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was 2 304 billion 1 50 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 in addition to the items impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by a use of cash from working capital in the current quarter as compared to a source of cash in the prior year quarter the use of cash in the company s non cash working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable related to increasing refinery margins at the end of the quarter and higher upstream sales volumes operating results suncor s total upstream production was 778 200 boe d during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 831 000 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower oil sands production as a result of planned maintenance and mandatory production curtailments in the province of alberta e p production volumes increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher production from east coast canada and oda during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company continued to leverage its regional footprint and asset flexibility to maximize the value of its allotted barrels under the mandatory production curtailment program the company was able to optimize the transfer of our allotted curtailment credits among the company s assets during planned maintenance at oil sands operations and syncrude while continuing to focus on higher value sco production upon completion of maintenance in the quarter the company was able to purchase additional curtailment credits from third parties as well as capitalize on the special production allowances announced by the government of alberta on october 31 2019 and effective december 1 2019 this program provides producers with temporary relief equivalent to incremental increases in rail shipments which is anticipated to continue into 2020 oil sands operations production was 418 100 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 432 700 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to maintenance including planned annual coker maintenance at oil sands base increased yield loss associated with higher sco production mandatory production curtailments and an outage at mackay river mackay river is expected to return to operation early in the second quarter of 2020 after completion of planned maintenance which has been accelerated to the first quarter of 2020 to coincide with the outage in an effort to minimize the impacts to annual production as a result of strong upgrader reliability sco production increased to 300 000 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite maintenance compared to 273 400 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 representing utilization rates of 86 and 79 respectively production of non upgraded bitumen from the company s in situ assets was 118 100 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 159 300 bbls d in the prior year quarter primarily impacted by the outage at mackay river and management of mandatory production curtailments which increased volumes diverted to upgrading as we continue to focus on value over volume through the production of higher value sco oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel increased to 28 55 in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 24 50 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of lower production volumes discussed above higher costs associated with increased production of higher value sco barrels as well as an increase in contractor mining shovel maintenance and commodity costs suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 87 900 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 98 500 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was due to planned maintenance which was completed during the quarter and mandatory production curtailments fort hills remains adversely impacted by mandatory production curtailment due to the continued disproportionate effect of curtailment as it is applied on a 2018 production basis when the asset was ramping up to full production rates however the company was able to partially mitigate production impacts by internally transferring credits from oil sands operations and purchasing third party credits fort hills cash operating costs per barrel averaged 28 65 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 24 85 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of lower production volumes and slightly higher cash operating costs due to the increase in planned maintenance suncor s share of syncrude production was 156 300 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 209 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to planned maintenance that commenced in the third quarter of 2019 and was completed within the fourth quarter compared to no planned maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and mandatory production curtailments upon completion of maintenance the company was able to partially mitigate impacts of curtailment on production by internally transferring and purchasing third party curtailment credits strong reliability following the maintenance was reflective of the asset s performance in the year with 2019 marking the second best year of production in the asset s history even when curtailed syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 39 85 in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase from 31 75 in the prior year quarter due primarily to the decrease in production partially offset by lower cash operating costs production volumes at e p were 115 900 boe d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 90 200 boe d in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to higher production at east coast canada and oda which began production in the first quarter of 2019 partially offset by natural declines in the united kingdom refinery crude throughput was 447 500 bbls d and refinery utilization remained strong at 97 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to crude throughput of 467 900 bbls d and refinery utilization of 101 in the prior year quarter refined product sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 534 600 bbls d compared to 530 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter reflecting strong retail volumes we demonstrated solid reliability across our refineries and upgraders during the quarter and while we had some operational challenges we completed significant maintenance across our upstream operations said little our strong upgrader reliability enabled the company to opportunistically focus on value over volume generating higher margin production during mandatory production curtailments strategy update in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor remained focused on maximizing the return to its shareholders through payment of 644 million of dividends and the repurchase of 11 1 million common shares for 452 million under the company s share repurchase program in 2019 the company returned 4 9 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders representing 45 of total funds from operations in addition to a reduction of debt of 425 million reflecting continued flexibility in the company s capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2019 the board approved an increase to the company s share repurchase program from 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion following this approval the toronto stock exchange accepted a notice to increase the maximum number of shares the company may purchase pursuant to its normal course issuer bid the increase to the program demonstrates confidence in the company s ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to return cash to shareholders subsequent to the end of the quarter the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 465 per share an increase of 11 and also approved authority to repurchase shares of up to 2 0 billion beginning march 1 2020 suncor continues to advance projects and investments intended to incrementally and sustainably grow annual free funds flow by reducing operating and

macdonald reports the duke and duchess of sussex have been living on vancouver island as they step away from royal duties in a beautiful 14 million estate in nearby north saanich like many other cities housing affordability is a huge issue in victoria according to the latest measure by national bank financial for a house the mortgage payment as a percentage of income rose in the fourth quarter of last year to 65 1 per cent from the previous three month period national bank deputy chief economist matthieu arseneau and economist kyle dahms found that s based on a representative home in the metropolitan market at about 854 300 for a condo it s substantially lower at 37 3 per cent you d need annual income of 177 346 to afford that representative home and it would take 103 months of saving for a down payment national bank said compare victoria with toronto where a mortgage payment as a percentage of income came in at 61 per cent and it takes annual income of 193 550 to support a purchase or vancouver where the corresponding numbers are 84 per cent and 222 381 and 377 months of saving for a down payment housing affordability statistics q4 2019 non condo homes market median

interest rates were essentially unchanged from q3 income growth was unable to keep pace with the rise in home prices for the urban composite they said referring to the group of cities they track among the 10 urban centres covered only vancouver and winnipeg saw income increasing faster than housing prices during the quarter they added vancouver was the only market showing an improvement in affordability the monthly mortgage payment as a percentage of income registering a fourth consecutive decline a first since 2008 2009 when the global economy was mired in a recession their national composite index stands on the cusp of its 20 year average they noted but that comes with widespread differences among the cities measured indeed despite some ameliorations over the past year the vancouver toronto and hamilton markets are still exhibiting affordability concerns while all other markets are either in line with their historical norms or even better mr arseneau and mr dahms said the widespread improvement in affordability occurred in 2019 thanks to an 85 basis points decline in mortgage interest rates and one of the smallest increases in home prices among oecd countries they added referencing canada s membership in the organization for economic co operation and development that said we doubt that a further improvement in home affordability is possible at this point as we see interest rates levelling off and home prices should accelerate given tight supply in the resale market victoria by the way showed improvement where condos are concerned and deterioration for other

from operations of 2 6 billion bringing annual funds from operations to a new record of 10 8 billion said mark little president and chief executive officer in 2019 we returned 4 9 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders representing 45 of our total funds from operations since the start of 2017 we have paid 7 1 billion in dividends and repurchased 6 7 billion of shares representing over 9 of our outstanding common shares demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns funds from operations were 2 553 billion 1 66 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the prior year quarter marking the tenth consecutive quarter above 2 billion cash flow provided by operating activities was 2 304 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3 040 billion in the prior year quarter as the prior year quarter included a source of cash in working capital associated with a declining price environment operating earnings were 782 million 0 51 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 580 million 0 36 per common share in the prior year quarter the company had a net loss of 2 335 billion 1 52 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to non cash asset impairment charges of 3 352 billion after tax primarily due to lower forecasted heavy oil prices for fort hills and higher capital cost estimates for the west white rose project compared to a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the prior year quarter in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor demonstrated its continued focus on value over volume as oil sands operations achieved synthetic crude oil sco production of 300 000 barrels per day bbls d and upgrader utilization of 86 compared to sco production of 273 400 bbls d and upgrader utilization of 79 in the prior year period with both periods impacted by maintenance total exploration and production e p production during the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to 115 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d from 90 200 boe d in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to higher production in east coast canada which increased to 69 600 bbls d from 47 900 bbls d in the prior year quarter reliable operations in refining and marketing drove refinery utilization of 97 and crude throughput of 447 500 bbls d suncor sanctioned the forty mile wind power project which is expected to drive value through sustainable low carbon power generation and the retention of generated carbon credits for utilization in suncor s upstream business subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 465 per share an increase of 11 the board also approved an increase to the company s existing share repurchase program from 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion through to the end of february 2020 and a further annual extension of the share repurchase program up to 2 0 billion beginning march 1 2020 demonstrating confidence in the company s ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to return cash to shareholders financial results operating earnings suncor s fourth quarter 2019 operating earnings were 782 million 0 51 per common share compared to 580 million 0 36 per common share in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily a result of improved western canadian crude oil differentials including a substantial narrowing of heavy crude and sco differentials which more than offset lower benchmark pricing from the prior year quarter this resulted in an increase in oil sands price realizations and a net favourable inventory valuation change partially offset by lower refining margins fourth quarter 2019 operating earnings were also positively impacted by increased production at east coast canada and oda operating earnings were unfavourably impacted by lower oil sands production compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to planned maintenance and the alberta government s mandatory production curtailments higher depreciation depletion and amortization dd a and royalties and lower refinery crude throughput net loss suncor s net loss was 2 335 billion 1 52 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors impacting operating earnings discussed above the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2019 included 3 352 billion of non cash after tax asset impairment charges partially offset by a 235 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt the net loss in the prior year quarter included an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 637 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a non cash impairment loss of 223 million after tax on one of the company s equity investments funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 553 billion 1 66 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were influenced primarily by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was 2 304 billion 1 50 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 in addition to the items impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by a use of cash from working capital in the current quarter as compared to a source of cash in the prior year quarter the use of cash in the company s non cash working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable related to increasing refinery margins at the end of the quarter and higher upstream sales volumes operating results suncor s total upstream production was 778 200 boe d during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 831 000 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower oil sands production as a result of planned maintenance and mandatory production curtailments in the province of alberta e p production volumes increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher production from east coast canada and oda during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company continued to leverage its regional footprint and asset flexibility to maximize the value of its allotted barrels under the mandatory production curtailment program the company was able to optimize the transfer of our allotted curtailment credits among the company s assets during planned maintenance at oil sands operations and syncrude while continuing to focus on higher value sco production upon completion of maintenance in the quarter the company was able to purchase additional curtailment credits from third parties as well as capitalize on the special production allowances announced by the government of alberta on october 31 2019 and effective december 1 2019 this program provides producers with temporary relief equivalent to incremental increases in rail shipments which is anticipated to continue into 2020 oil sands operations production was 418 100 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 432 700 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to maintenance including planned annual coker maintenance at oil sands base increased yield loss associated with higher sco production mandatory production curtailments and an outage at mackay river mackay river is expected to return to operation early in the second quarter of 2020 after completion of planned maintenance which has been accelerated to the first quarter of 2020 to coincide with the outage in an effort to minimize the impacts to annual production as a result of strong upgrader reliability sco production increased to 300 000 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite maintenance compared to 273 400 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 representing utilization rates of 86 and 79 respectively production of non upgraded bitumen from the company s in situ assets was 118 100 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 159 300 bbls d in the prior year quarter primarily impacted by the outage at mackay river and management of mandatory production curtailments which increased volumes diverted to upgrading as we continue to focus on value over volume through the production of higher value sco oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel increased to 28 55 in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 24 50 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of lower production volumes discussed above higher costs associated with increased production of higher value sco barrels as well as an increase in contractor mining shovel maintenance and commodity costs suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 87 900 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 98 500 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was due to planned maintenance which was completed during the quarter and mandatory production curtailments fort hills remains adversely impacted by mandatory production curtailment due to the continued disproportionate effect of curtailment as it is applied on a 2018 production basis when the asset was ramping up to full production rates however the company was able to partially mitigate production impacts by internally transferring credits from oil sands operations and purchasing third party credits fort hills cash operating costs per barrel averaged 28 65 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 24 85 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of lower production volumes and slightly higher cash operating costs due to the increase in planned maintenance suncor s share of syncrude production was 156 300 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 209 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to planned maintenance that commenced in the third quarter of 2019 and was completed within the fourth quarter compared to no planned maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and mandatory production curtailments upon completion of maintenance the company was able to partially mitigate impacts of curtailment on production by internally transferring and purchasing third party curtailment credits strong reliability following the maintenance was reflective of the asset s performance in the year with 2019 marking the second best year of production in the asset s history even when curtailed syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 39 85 in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase from 31 75 in the prior year quarter due primarily to the decrease in production partially offset by lower cash operating costs production volumes at e p were 115 900 boe d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 90 200 boe d in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to higher production at east coast canada and oda which began production in the first quarter of 2019 partially offset by natural declines in the united kingdom refinery crude throughput was 447 500 bbls d and refinery utilization remained strong at 97 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to crude throughput of 467 900 bbls d and refinery utilization of 101 in the prior year quarter refined product sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 534 600 bbls d compared to 530 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter reflecting strong retail volumes we demonstrated solid reliability across our refineries and upgraders during the quarter and while we had some operational challenges we completed significant maintenance across our upstream operations said little our strong upgrader reliability enabled the company to opportunistically focus on value over volume generating higher margin production during mandatory production curtailments strategy update in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor remained focused on maximizing the return to its shareholders through payment of 644 million of dividends and the repurchase of 11 1 million common shares for 452 million under the company s share repurchase program in 2019 the company returned 4 9 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders representing 45 of total funds from operations in addition to a reduction of debt of 425 million reflecting continued flexibility in the company s capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2019 the board approved an increase to the company s share repurchase program from 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion following this approval the toronto stock exchange accepted a notice to increase the maximum number of shares the company may purchase pursuant to its normal course issuer bid the increase to the program demonstrates confidence in the company s ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to return cash to shareholders subsequent to the end of the quarter the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 465 per share an increase of 11 and also approved authority to repurchase shares of up to 2 0 billion beginning march 1 2020 suncor continues to advance projects and investments intended to incrementally and sustainably grow annual free funds flow by reducing operating and sustainment costs and investing in projects that enhance value within our existing integrated asset base while moving forward in the areas of safety reliability and sustainability suncor is focused on

power project has an estimated total capital spend of 300 million with 25 of the capital spent in 2019 and the remainder to be spent over the next two years this investment approach in renewable energy is expected to generate significant value through sustainable low carbon power generation and the retention of generated carbon credits for utilization in suncor s upstream business together with the cogeneration facility suncor has sanctioned projects in 2019 that are expected to achieve one third of our ghg emissions intensity reduction goal in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company also finalized an additional 50 million equity investment in enerkem inc a waste to biofuels and chemicals producer bringing the company s total equity investment to 73 million suncor continues to invest in high return projects and in the fourth quarter of 2019 sanctioned the forty mile wind power project which is designed to provide reliable low carbon power to the alberta power grid said

jordan s four year agreement with the international monetary fund for 1 3 billion dh4 8bn of funding broadly supports its economy and reform agenda but the country s fiscal consolidation efforts continue to face headwinds amid historically low growth ratings agency fitch said jordan s budget performance in 2019 that fell short of targets and the agreed budget for this year underpin the kingdom s economic difficulties fitch said prior to the agreement with the washington lender both budgets projected a deficit of 3 9 per cent of gross domestic product while we expected jordan to negotiate a fresh and expanded imf programme the budget numbers are worse than our forecasts fitch said external finances improved as expected in 2019 with reserves remaining robust the preliminary agreement reached with the imf at the end of january on a 1 3bn four year extended fund facility eff helps supports jordan s economic growth and improve its fiscal and external finances the kingdom s economy since 2010 has expanded at an average of 2 to 2 5 per cent the imf projects the economy will grow 2 1 per cent this year while inflation will remain subdued at below 1 per cent the new eff could also be subject to slow implementation and delayed disbursements but the risk is reduced to some extent because it does not include new taxation fitch said the budget this year assumes 10 per cent growth in domestic revenue it expects an increase of 733m jordanian dinars dh3 8bn in revenue on the back of 4 per cent rise in nominal gdp and stronger implementation of the income tax law this may prove optimistic which would put jordan at risk of missing its deficit target again although the impact on the deficit may be contained by under execution of plans for a 33 per cent rise in capex fitch said economic growth is a priority of the new programme which has set 3 3 per cent expansion as a medium term target jordan s growth averaged 6 5 per cent in 2000 09 when external conditions both economically and politically were more favourable jordan is trying to balance its debt obligations with economic growth to provide jobs for a fast growing population where 40 per cent of 15 to 35 year old are unemployed the country which relies of foreign grants and aid to finance its fiscal and current account deficits imports more than 90 per cent of its energy needs which makes it vulnerable to oil price fluctuations the imf package said gradual fiscal consolidation coupled with reform initiatives will help reduce government debt the lender called on jordan to reform its electricity sector and refine its allocation of subsidies to households based on need the latest deal supersedes and expands the previous 723 million three year eff agreed in august 2016 under which jordan accessed only 309m reforms progressed slowly in the face of public protest which forced a change in the country s government in 2018

release references to oil sands operations exclude suncor energy inc s suncor or the company interests in fort hills and syncrude calgary alberta feb 05 2020 globe newswire in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor generated funds from operations of 2 6 billion bringing annual funds from operations to a new record of 10 8 billion said mark little president and chief executive officer in 2019 we returned 4 9 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders representing 45 of our total funds from operations since the start of 2017 we have paid 7 1 billion in dividends and repurchased 6 7 billion of shares representing over 9 of our outstanding common shares demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns funds from operations were 2 553 billion 1 66 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the prior year quarter marking the tenth consecutive quarter above 2 billion cash flow provided by operating activities was 2 304 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3 040 billion in the prior year quarter as the prior year quarter included a source of cash in working capital associated with a declining price environment operating earnings were 782 million 0 51 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 580 million 0 36 per common share in the prior year quarter the company had a net loss of 2 335 billion 1 52 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to non cash asset impairment charges of 3 352 billion after tax primarily due to lower forecasted heavy oil prices for fort hills and higher capital cost estimates for the west white rose project compared to a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the prior year quarter in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor demonstrated its continued focus on value over volume as oil sands operations achieved synthetic crude oil sco production of 300 000 barrels per day bbls d and upgrader utilization of 86 compared to sco production of 273 400 bbls d and upgrader utilization of 79 in the prior year period with both periods impacted by maintenance total exploration and production e p production during the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to 115 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d from 90 200 boe d in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to higher production in east coast canada which increased to 69 600 bbls d from 47 900 bbls d in the prior year quarter reliable operations in refining and marketing drove refinery utilization of 97 and crude throughput of 447 500 bbls d suncor sanctioned the forty mile wind power project which is expected to drive value through sustainable low carbon power generation and the retention of generated carbon credits for utilization in suncor s upstream business subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 465 per share an increase of 11 the board also approved an increase to the company s existing share repurchase program from 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion through to the end of february 2020 and a further annual extension of the share repurchase program up to 2 0 billion beginning march 1 2020 demonstrating confidence in the company s ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to return cash to shareholders financial results operating earnings suncor s fourth quarter 2019 operating earnings were 782 million 0 51 per common share compared to 580 million 0 36 per common share in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily a result of improved western canadian crude oil differentials including a substantial narrowing of heavy crude and sco differentials which more than offset lower benchmark pricing from the prior year quarter this resulted in an increase in oil sands price realizations and a net favourable inventory valuation change partially offset by lower refining margins fourth quarter 2019 operating earnings were also positively impacted by increased production at east coast canada and oda operating earnings were unfavourably impacted by lower oil sands production compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to planned maintenance and the alberta government s mandatory production curtailments higher depreciation depletion and amortization dd a and royalties and lower refinery crude throughput net loss suncor s net loss was 2 335 billion 1 52 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors impacting operating earnings discussed above the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2019 included 3 352 billion of non cash after tax asset impairment charges partially offset by a 235 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt the net loss in the prior year quarter included an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 637 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a non cash impairment loss of 223 million after tax on one of the company s equity investments funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 553 billion 1 66 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were influenced primarily by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was 2 304 billion 1 50 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 in addition to the items impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by a use of cash from working capital in the current quarter as compared to a source of cash in the prior year quarter the use of cash in the company s non cash working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable related to increasing refinery margins at the end of the quarter and higher upstream sales volumes operating results suncor s total upstream production was 778 200 boe d during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 831 000 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower oil sands production as a result of planned maintenance and mandatory production curtailments in the province of alberta e p production volumes increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher production from east coast canada and oda during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company continued to leverage its regional footprint and asset flexibility to maximize the value of its allotted barrels under the mandatory production curtailment program the company was able to optimize the transfer of our allotted curtailment credits among the company s assets during planned maintenance at oil sands operations and syncrude while continuing to focus on higher value sco production upon completion of maintenance in the quarter the company was able to purchase additional curtailment credits from third parties as well as capitalize on the special production allowances announced by the government of alberta on october 31 2019 and effective december 1 2019 this program provides producers with temporary relief equivalent to incremental increases in rail shipments which is anticipated to continue into 2020 oil sands operations production was 418 100 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 432 700 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to maintenance including planned annual coker maintenance at oil sands base increased yield loss associated with higher sco production mandatory production curtailments and an outage at mackay river mackay river is expected to return to operation early in the second quarter of 2020 after completion of planned maintenance which has been accelerated to the first quarter of 2020 to coincide with the outage in an effort to minimize the impacts to annual production as a result of strong upgrader reliability sco production increased to 300 000 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite maintenance compared to 273 400 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 representing utilization rates of 86 and 79 respectively production of non upgraded bitumen from the company s in situ assets was 118 100 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 159 300 bbls d in the prior year quarter primarily impacted by the outage at mackay river and management of mandatory production curtailments which increased volumes diverted to upgrading as we continue to focus on value over volume through the production of higher value sco oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel increased to 28 55 in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 24 50 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of lower production volumes discussed above higher costs associated with increased production of higher value sco barrels as well as an increase in contractor mining shovel maintenance and commodity costs suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 87 900 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 98 500 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was due to planned maintenance which was completed during the quarter and mandatory production curtailments fort hills remains adversely impacted by mandatory production curtailment due to the continued disproportionate effect of curtailment as it is applied on a 2018 production basis when the asset was ramping up to full production rates however the company was able to partially mitigate production impacts by internally transferring credits from oil sands operations and purchasing third party credits fort hills cash operating costs per barrel averaged 28 65 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 24 85 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of lower production volumes and slightly higher cash operating costs due to the increase in planned maintenance suncor s share of syncrude production was 156 300 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 209 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to planned maintenance that commenced in the third quarter of 2019 and was completed within the fourth quarter compared to no planned maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and mandatory production curtailments upon completion of maintenance the company was able to partially mitigate impacts of curtailment on production by internally transferring and purchasing third party curtailment credits strong reliability following the maintenance was reflective of the asset s performance in the year with 2019 marking the second best year of production in the asset s history even when curtailed syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 39 85 in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase from 31 75 in the prior year quarter due primarily to the decrease in production partially offset by lower cash operating costs production volumes at e p were 115 900 boe d in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 90 200 boe d in the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to higher production at east coast canada and oda which began production in the first quarter of 2019 partially offset by natural declines in the united kingdom refinery crude throughput was 447 500 bbls d and refinery utilization remained strong at 97 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to crude throughput of 467 900 bbls d and refinery utilization of 101 in the prior year quarter refined product sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 534 600 bbls d compared to 530 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter reflecting strong retail volumes we demonstrated solid reliability across our refineries and upgraders during the quarter and while we had some operational challenges we completed significant maintenance across our upstream operations said little our strong upgrader reliability enabled the company to opportunistically focus on value over volume generating higher margin production during mandatory production curtailments strategy update in the fourth quarter of 2019 suncor remained focused on maximizing the return to its shareholders through payment of 644 million of dividends and the repurchase of 11 1 million common shares for 452 million under the company s share repurchase program in 2019 the company returned 4 9 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders representing 45 of total funds from operations in addition to a reduction of debt of 425 million reflecting continued flexibility in the company s capital allocation strategy in the fourth quarter of 2019 the board approved an increase to the company s share repurchase program from 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion following this approval the toronto stock exchange accepted a notice to increase the maximum number of shares the company may purchase pursuant to its normal course issuer bid the increase to the program demonstrates confidence in the company s ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to return cash to shareholders subsequent to the end of the quarter the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 465 per share an increase of 11 and also approved authority to repurchase shares of up to 2 0 billion beginning march 1 2020 suncor continues to advance projects and investments intended to incrementally and sustainably grow annual free funds flow by reducing operating and

reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2019 over the last twenty years we have established ourselves as one of the leading producers of renewable resources globally said sachin shan ceo of brookfield renewable we have built a business where the generation from our 19 000 megawatt fleet avoids approximately 27 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually all while delivering strong compound returns to our unitholders looking forward we believe our global scale operational depth and financial strength position us well to participate in the global trend towards decarbonization while continuing to deliver 12 15 long term returns on a per unit basis financial results for the periods ended december 31 millions except per unit or otherwise

unit after deducting non cash depreciation our net loss attributable to unitholders for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was 59 million or 0 19 per unit these results were supported by contributions from recent acquisitions and newly commissioned facilities and execution on our key operating initiatives highlights increased ffo per unit by 13 driven by accretive growth and strong operational performance we continue our track record of strong ffo per unit growth at a 10 annual growth rate since our strategic combination with brookfield s renewable assets in 2011 we advanced key commercial priorities and delivered on cost saving initiatives totaling 40 million globally on an annualized basis 12 million net to bep invested 2 billion 550 million net to bep of equity in nine transactions including doubling the size of our asian and distributed generation businesses adding a leading global solar developer and investing in a hydro portfolio in canada commissioned 50 megawatts of new capacity progressed approximately 2 100 megawatts through construction and advanced stage permitting and increased the size of our development pipeline to approximately 13 000 megawatts maintained our robust investment grade balance sheet ended the year with 2 7 billion of available liquidity and raised approximately 1 4 billion in incremental liquidity through asset sales and strategic upfinancings and announced the creation of a canadian corporation bepc that will provide investors the optionality to invest in bep through either the current partnership or through a corporation which is expected to support the expansion of our investor base update on growth initiatives during the fourth quarter we closed our acquisition of a 50 interest in x elio a leading global solar developer with this acquisition we have significantly enhanced our solar development capabilities adding 972 megawatts of operating assets and almost 6 000 megawatts to our global construction and development pipeline also in the fourth quarter we signed two agreements to acquire 14 solar development projects in brazil with 428 mw of total capacity for total consideration of 120 million 30 million net to bep both these transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and represent attractive additions to our business in brazil with approximately 2 100 mw of capacity across multiple technologies hydro wind and solar furthermore through our interest in terraform power we acquired 44 mw of pv solar assets in spain for 70 million and signed an agreement to acquire 100 mw of solar csp assets in spain located proximate to terraform power s csp plants for 115 million which terraform power expects to close in the first quarter of 2020 operations in 2019 we generated ffo of 761 million a 13 increase over the prior year as the business benefitted from recent acquisitions strong operational performance and execution on margin enhancement initiatives during the year our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of 720 million representing a 7 increase over the prior year our storage segment also performed well generating 27 million of ffo in the year as our portfolio continues to provide critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and backup capacity to increasingly intermittent grids during the year our generation was roughly in line with the long term average as we continue to benefit from the diversity of our fleet our priority over the past decade has been to diversify the business which over the long term mitigates exposure to resource volatility regional or market disruptions and potential credit events we also continued to execute on key contracting initiatives across all our businesses our focus in latin america continues to be on extending the average duration of our power purchase agreements which today stands at 10 years in brazil and 3 years in colombia as well as signing contracts with high quality credit worthy counterparties globally we continue to see increasing value ascribed to the unique scale renewable storage capabilities that hydroelectric assets provide to increasingly intermittent electricity grids for example in colombia we secured 3 million of ancillary services revenues in the united states we qualified to receive the highest tier renewable energy credits for a number of our hydroelectric assets in the northeast which will contribute 3 million to ffo annually and in the u k our first hydro portfolio was the critical link to restarting the grid following a nation wide blackout in august our wind and solar segments generated a combined 274 million of ffo representing an 18 increase over the prior year these portfolios benefitted from contributions from recent growth initiatives including the acquisition of two wind portfolios in asia and through our interest in terraform power a large distributed generation portfolio in the united states and full year contributions from saeta yield a scale european wind and solar portfolio we also benefitted from executing on opportunistic o m outsourcing agreements aimed at de risking the portfolios owned by terraform power and where appropriate delivering cost savings we executed on three such agreements across terraform power and our wind portfolio in brazil a common theme across all these opportunities was attractive availability guarantees and a more comprehensive scope than what was currently in place at terraform power these initiatives will deliver aggregate cost savings of approximately 30 million 9 million net to bep finally we continued to advance our global greenfield development activities including progressing 717 megawatts of construction diversified across distributed and utility scale solar wind storage and hydro in 7 different countries we are also progressing 1 380 megawatts of advanced stage projects through final permitting and contracting and our total greenfield development pipeline now totals approximately 13 000 megawatts of note during the year we signed power purchase agreements for three wind repowering projects in new york and california totaling 220 megawatts and these projects are expected to be commissioned in 2021 environmental social and governance esg reporting we have been owner operators of long duration critical electricity assets for over a century and therefore understand that embedding strong esg practices into our investing and operating activities is essential to preserving capital mitigating risk and creating long term value fundamentally strong esg practices drive further economic value to our business and inherently create higher barriers to entry as such we integrate relevant esg considerations into our investing and operating strategies we are therefore proud to announce that we are publishing our inaugural esg report which among other things illustrates the on the ground work we do to maintain our social license to operate with one of the largest public pure play renewable portfolios globally we are helping to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids additionally maintaining socially responsible practices from health and safety to community relations to biodiversity is a critical component of successful operations over the long term we operate with the highest ethical standards conducting our business with integrity and above compliance with laws and regulations we aim for best practice everywhere we operate esg and sustainability investing continues to gain momentum globally with esg funds expected to rise into the trillions over the next decade we believe our portfolio s inherent environmental attributes coupled with our long standing practices around maintaining a social license to operate provide significant tailwinds to demand growth for brookfield renewable balance sheet and liquidity our liquidity position remains robust with 2 7 billion of total available liquidity at year end during the year we executed on key financing and capital raising initiatives aimed at maintaining robust access to capital a prudent debt maturity ladder and a low risk investment grade balance sheet during the year we executed on more than 6 billion of financings across the business which allowed us to raise 1 billion of incremental liquidity to bep extend our average debt portfolio duration to 10 years and reduce annual interest costs by 15 million 9 million net to bep of note we continue to advance our green financing strategy in order to capitalize on growing demand for carbon free debt products and diversify our debt investor base to date we have issued six green bonds at both the corporate and project levels which all together totaled approximately 2 4 billion during the fourth quarter we also closed our first incentive linked loan as part of our corporate credit facility that will allow us to reduce our cost of borrowing as we continue to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids as demand for sustainability focused investing continues to grow we expect green financings and sustainability linked loans will increasingly become a more prominent funding lever within our business in 2019 we also continued to execute our capital recycling strategy of selling mature de risked or non core assets to lower cost of capital buyers and redeploying the proceeds into higher yielding opportunities during the year we raised almost 600 million 365 million net to bep through this funding strategy allowing us to crystallize an approximate 18 return on our portuguese and northern ireland wind assets and to return more than two times our capital invested in south africa distribution currency option the

this news release does not constitute an offer to sell securities nor is it a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction not for distribution or for dissemination in the united states reserve advisory the recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil reserves provided in this news release are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein all december 31 2019 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2020 all december 31 2018 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2019 all december 31 2017 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2018 it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves it is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil bbl boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22 3 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 31 1 degrees api gravity and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 22 3 degrees api gravity with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for that year references to initial production test rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for parex parex cautions that short term production rates should be considered preliminary this press release contains several oil and gas metrics including f d costs fd a costs recycle ratio reserve replacement nav and rli these oil and gas metrics have been prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the company s operations over time readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this news release should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes a summary of the calculations of such metrics are as follows finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing capital expenditures by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category f d costs including fdc include all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition fd a costs represent the costs of property acquisition exploration and development incurred the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fd a costs are calculated as capital expenditures plus net acquisition costs plus change in fdc fd a per boe is calculated as fd a costs divided by reserves additions for the applicable period recycle ratio is calculated as funds flow from operations netback divided by f d or fd a as applicable funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure that includes all cash generated from operating activities and is calculated before changes in non cash working capital funds flow from operations netback or funds flow from operations per boe is calculated by dividing funds flow from operations by sales volumes for the period reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual reserve additions by the annual production net asset value nav per share is calculated as before or after tax npv10 plus estimated year end working capital converted from usd to cad as applicable divided by basic shares outstanding at december 31 2019 reserves life index is calculated by dividing the

unit after deducting non cash depreciation our net loss attributable to unitholders for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was 59 million or 0 19 per unit these results were supported by contributions from recent acquisitions and newly commissioned facilities and execution on our key operating initiatives highlights increased ffo per unit by 13 driven by accretive growth and strong operational performance we continue our track record of strong ffo per unit growth at a 10 annual growth rate since our strategic combination with brookfield s renewable assets in 2011 we advanced key commercial priorities and delivered on cost saving initiatives totaling 40 million globally on an annualized basis 12 million net to bep invested 2 billion 550 million net to bep of equity in nine transactions including doubling the size of our asian and distributed generation businesses adding a leading global solar developer and investing in a hydro portfolio in canada commissioned 50 megawatts of new capacity progressed approximately 2 100 megawatts through construction and advanced stage permitting and increased the size of our development pipeline to approximately 13 000 megawatts maintained our robust investment grade balance sheet ended the year with 2 7 billion of available liquidity and raised approximately 1 4 billion in incremental liquidity through asset sales and strategic upfinancings and announced the creation of a canadian corporation bepc that will provide investors the optionality to invest in bep through either the current partnership or through a corporation which is expected to support the expansion of our investor base update on growth initiatives during the fourth quarter we closed our acquisition of a 50 interest in x elio a leading global solar developer with this acquisition we have significantly enhanced our solar development capabilities adding 972 megawatts of operating assets and almost 6 000 megawatts to our global construction and development pipeline also in the fourth quarter we signed two agreements to acquire 14 solar development projects in brazil with 428 mw of total capacity for total consideration of 120 million 30 million net to bep both these transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and represent attractive additions to our business in brazil with approximately 2 100 mw of capacity across multiple technologies hydro wind and solar furthermore through our interest in terraform power we acquired 44 mw of pv solar assets in spain for 70 million and signed an agreement to acquire 100 mw of solar csp assets in spain located proximate to terraform power s csp plants for 115 million which terraform power expects to close in the first quarter of 2020 operations in 2019 we generated ffo of 761 million a 13 increase over the prior year as the business benefitted from recent acquisitions strong operational performance and execution on margin enhancement initiatives during the year our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of 720 million representing a 7 increase over the prior year our storage segment also performed well generating 27 million of ffo in the year as our portfolio continues to provide critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and backup capacity to increasingly intermittent grids during the year our generation was roughly in line with the long term average as we continue to benefit from the diversity of our fleet our priority over the past decade has been to diversify the business which over the long term mitigates exposure to resource volatility regional or market disruptions and potential credit events we also continued to execute on key contracting initiatives across all our businesses our focus in latin america continues to be on extending the average duration of our power purchase agreements which today stands at 10 years in brazil and 3 years in colombia as well as signing contracts with high quality credit worthy counterparties globally we continue to see increasing value ascribed to the unique scale renewable storage capabilities that hydroelectric assets provide to increasingly intermittent electricity grids for example in colombia we secured 3 million of ancillary services revenues in the united states we qualified to receive the highest tier renewable energy credits for a number of our hydroelectric assets in the northeast which will contribute 3 million to ffo annually and in the u k our first hydro portfolio was the critical link to restarting the grid following a nation wide blackout in august our wind and solar segments generated a combined 274 million of ffo representing an 18 increase over the prior year these portfolios benefitted from contributions from recent growth initiatives including the acquisition of two wind portfolios in asia and through our interest in terraform power a large distributed generation portfolio in the united states and full year contributions from saeta yield a scale european wind and solar portfolio we also benefitted from executing on opportunistic o m outsourcing agreements aimed at de risking the portfolios owned by terraform power and where appropriate delivering cost savings we executed on three such agreements across terraform power and our wind portfolio in brazil a common theme across all these opportunities was attractive availability guarantees and a more comprehensive scope than what was currently in place at terraform power these initiatives will deliver aggregate cost savings of approximately 30 million 9 million net to bep finally we continued to advance our global greenfield development activities including progressing 717 megawatts of construction diversified across distributed and utility scale solar wind storage and hydro in 7 different countries we are also progressing 1 380 megawatts of advanced stage projects through final permitting and contracting and our total greenfield development pipeline now totals approximately 13 000 megawatts of note during the year we signed power purchase agreements for three wind repowering projects in new york and california totaling 220 megawatts and these projects are expected to be commissioned in 2021 environmental social and governance esg reporting we have been owner operators of long duration critical electricity assets for over a century and therefore understand that embedding strong esg practices into our investing and operating activities is essential to preserving capital mitigating risk and creating long term value fundamentally strong esg practices drive further economic value to our business and inherently create higher barriers to entry as such we integrate relevant esg considerations into our investing and operating strategies we are therefore proud to announce that we are publishing our inaugural esg report which among other things illustrates the on the ground work we do to maintain our social license to operate with one of the largest public pure play renewable portfolios globally we are helping to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids additionally maintaining socially responsible practices from health and safety to community relations to biodiversity is a critical component of successful operations over the long term we operate with the highest ethical standards conducting our business with integrity and above compliance with laws and regulations we aim for best practice everywhere we operate esg and sustainability investing continues to gain momentum globally with esg funds expected to rise into the trillions over the next decade we believe our portfolio s inherent environmental attributes coupled with our long standing practices around maintaining a social license to operate provide significant tailwinds to demand growth for brookfield renewable balance sheet and liquidity our liquidity position remains robust with 2 7 billion of total available liquidity at year end during the year we executed on key financing and capital raising initiatives aimed at maintaining robust access to capital a prudent debt maturity ladder and a low risk investment grade balance sheet during the year we executed on more than 6 billion of financings across the business which allowed us to raise 1 billion of incremental liquidity to bep extend our average debt portfolio duration to 10 years and reduce annual interest costs by 15 million 9 million net to bep of note we continue to advance our green financing strategy in order to capitalize on growing demand for carbon free debt products and diversify our debt investor base to date we have issued six green bonds at both the corporate and project levels which all together totaled approximately 2 4 billion during the fourth quarter we also closed our first incentive linked loan as part of our corporate credit facility that will allow us to reduce our cost of borrowing as we continue to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids as demand for sustainability focused investing continues to grow we expect green financings and sustainability linked loans will increasingly become a more prominent funding lever within our business in 2019 we also continued to execute our capital recycling strategy of selling mature de risked or non core assets to lower cost of capital buyers and redeploying the proceeds into higher yielding opportunities during the year we raised almost 600 million 365 million net to bep through this funding strategy allowing us to crystallize an approximate 18 return on our portuguese and northern ireland wind assets and to return more than two times our capital invested in south africa distribution currency option the

consume and use every day sign up for our free newsletter and receive our best trading ideas and research leave this field empty if you re human crb commodities is made up of the following weighting softs coffee sugar orange juice 23 5 energy 17 6 grains 17 6 precious metals 17 6 industrials copper cotton 11 8 meats 11 8 commodities big picture on a monthly time frame show that we are still in a multi decade low yields have been falling reflecting concerns about global growth and also the dramatic change of direction by central banks which was itself largely driven by fears for growth the 10 year treasury yield is now almost a full percentage point lower than it was two years ago and its trend is clearly downward indeed if we take inflation expectations into account the real 10 year treasury yield has just gone negative according to the bloomberg commodity indexes industrial metals have now under performed precious metals over the period since donald trump was elected u s president and the price of oil is collapsing anew relative to gold these moves only make sense if people are worried about growth john authers bloomberg sounds dreary and john s commentary was before the coronavirus outbreak really grabbed american businesses attention despite my bearish leanings as detailed here perfect storm coronavirus and market risks from my vantage point we should bounce soon yellow circle if not we have more serious deflation to deal with not just disinflation in the commodity patch now let s drop the usd softly behind the same chart and add some annotations we have potential for a bounce but also a lot of resistance and indecision no clean signal yet still chop and a dxy that has been range bound for 4 years clearly the us dollar makes the weather for commodities and foreign exchange volatility as at an all time low you know my saying outliers revert with velocity watch the usd for the tell i should also add to this intermarket analysis with the macro read it s bearish inflation isabelnet_sa chart is suggesting that m2 velocity yoy leads us core inflation by 21 months it has been quite accurate for more than 20 years and it portends lower commodities dead long live commodities so why fight the trend humor me for the other side of the argument let s assume inflation catches a bounce pulling up commodities and yields with it what segments are most likely to rise food softs grains meats china is experiencing strong food price inflation from drought conditions rice culling of all that pork and soon chicken but in the us these input prices are declerating coffee corn hogs etc with the new coronavirus shutting off the flow of goods into and out of china for the time being and i suspect until april may we could start to see a tick up in food prices worst case as the pandemic spreads people with be unwilling unable to go to work which could also trigger supply chain constraints prices could accelerate quickly on supply contraction energy what s the bull case for energy oversold value play with high trailing dividend yields they are high for a reason and still major laggard of all spy sectors several years now oil investment is waning not expanding given trump s energy policies so aside from a geopolitical flare to temporarily disrupt supply like with iran the case for sustainable higher oil is weak and if when venezuela comes back online it would be a big hit to the bull case more supply in the meantime we have demand destruction out of china as a result of the coronavirus and general trends in decreasing demand due to 1 deglobalization 2 decarbonization 3 debt saturation 4 donald trump industrials copper is the big one and it is at 2016 levels so not expressing an economic growth look translation the trump bump 2017 has been dumped precious metals here are two charts that sum up my frustration on the perception versus reality of bidding up precious metals separate from the whole palladium and platinum play which i have written about since early november as a bullish thesis treasury yields are negative after adjusting for inflation so that is supposed to be a plus for gold but gold silver mining stocks are looking weary and potentially rolling over ok i may have talked you out of a commodity bump but stick with me commodities the new bonds just over a year ago the fed finished systematically hiking rates after 8 of them as ecb quit qe today fed has lowered rates 3 times in 2019 and market is pricing in 2 more cuts for 2020 fed clearly seems to unwind their 2017 tightening to avoid what happened in fall of 2018 where u s stocks collapsed nearly 20 from oct 3 to dec 31st basically the fed realized it had spent three years tightening into a low inflation low growth u s economy and the global economy was too fragile to handle the liquidity and tightening drain but rate cuts at this point have reached the law of diminishing returns and repo operations to inject capital in the money markets seems inadequate to jump start growth fiscal policies in combination may be the fuel that flame inflation in which case commodities could recover and rally but there are some heady headwinds headwinds demand destruction from slowing global growth from coronavirus in particular economic cycle and protectionist trends in general lower yields pull commodities with it and vice versa but right now fed has their proverbial thumb on any increases global central banks have suppressed volatility by anchoring expectations with lower for longer thereby enhancing the effect of rate cuts which suppresses commodities a more dovish fed also reduces the us foreign bond yield spread which strengthens the dollar thereby suppressing local currency valuation while burdening thier usd funding obligations a stronger dollar is tailwind to commodity run inversely related since commodities are priced in usd tailwinds local and coordinated global fiscal policies trigger global economic optimism debt and deficit hawks be damned containment of coronavirus psychologically and financially allow for economic expansion both will drive yields higher until these factors reveal themselves yields are falling and at risk of breaking critical support top 10 reasons for bond reversal from buy bonds wear zirconia yields are approaching my buy point just above all time lows bonds yields are on their respective bollinger bands keltner channel bands yellow circle on weekly chart which often acts as resistance causing a rubberband snap back effect seasonal tendency to sell bonds starts jan 31st nomura s charlie mcelligott 1m price reversal trade has run its course 1 94 drop to 1 64 in 10 yr yield since dec 18th duration infatuation the safety trade often kicks in at the first sign of trouble but then unwinds the normal viral drag on us10yr has the following tendency yields fall then bounce back sharply fed won t want the yield curve inversion which already erased half of the q4 steepening updated pre fomc fed may need to guide inflation above target which in turn supports a steeper curve so there is strong potential for final 2020 rate cut to cause inflation expectations to rise and the best reason potentially of all stocks are now yielding more than bonds again in the early summer of last year the 10 year treasury note was bid up considerably resulting in it yielding less than the s p 500 s dividend yield in fact at the point of the largest divergence between the two in late august the dividend yield of the s p 500 was 56 9 bps higher than the yield on the 10 year treasury although the disparity between the two has shrunk from that august peak that trend has generally continued in the months since then though equities surge into the end of the year saw bonds briefly yielding more in december since the start of the new year stocks once again hold a higher yield especially today as worries about the coronavirus have resulted in the selling of risk assets raising the s p 500 s yield and subsequent buying of safe havens lowering the 10 year treasury yield now the spread between the s p 500 s dividend yield and that of the 10 year is at its widest level in favor of the s p 500 since october 10th datatrek i am nothing if not persistent here is my client post from january 24th on this related subject all alone with my higher yield thesis high yield corporate debt is in trouble with oil dropping 20 since jan 7th and shale companies facing their biggest loan refinancing wall in 20 years when hy credit passes 358 bp then momentum will very likely sell off like happened in early september 2019 and value will finally catch a sustainable bid and when hedge funds cover their value shorts they sell bonds and when bonds get sold with momentum selling off too rates rip and we have a perfect storm set up for a massive vix spike and gamma flipping that is still my baseline projection market just doesn t see it yet samantha laduc is

measures the information presented herein includes certain financial measures such as adjusted ebitda non ifrs gross profit non ifrs general and administrative expenses non ifrs research and development expenses and non ifrs sales and marketing expenses these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management s perspective accordingly these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under ifrs these non ifrs measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus may highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures we also believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non ifrs measures in the evaluation of issuers our management also uses non ifrs measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation non ifrs gross profit non ifrs general and administrative expenses non ifrs research and development expenses and non ifrs sales and marketing expenses are non ifrs financial measures that exclude the effect of stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes and in the case of non ifrs general and administrative expenses transaction related costs

recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein all december 31 2019 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2020 all december 31 2018 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2019 all december 31 2017 reserves presented are based on glj s forecast pricing effective january 1 2018 it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented herein represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty proved developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption of production is unknown proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category proved probable possible to which they are assigned proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves it is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil bbl boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 1 may be misleading as an indication of value light crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 31 1 degrees api gravity medium crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 22 3 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 31 1 degrees api gravity and heavy crude oil is crude oil with a relative density greater than 10 degrees api gravity and less than or equal to 22 3 degrees api gravity with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserve additions for that year references to initial production test rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for parex parex cautions that short term production rates should be considered preliminary this press release contains several oil and gas metrics including f d costs fd a costs recycle ratio reserve replacement nav and rli these oil and gas metrics have been prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the company s operations over time readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this news release should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes a summary of the calculations of such metrics are as follows finding and development f d costs are calculated by dividing capital expenditures by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category f d costs including fdc include all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production finding development and acquisition fd a costs represent the costs of property acquisition exploration and development incurred the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fd a costs are calculated as capital expenditures plus net acquisition costs plus change in fdc fd a per boe is calculated as fd a costs divided by reserves additions for the applicable period recycle ratio is calculated as funds flow from operations netback divided by f d or fd a as applicable funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure that includes all cash generated from operating activities and is calculated before changes in non cash working capital funds flow from operations netback or funds flow from operations per boe is calculated by dividing funds flow from operations by sales volumes for the period reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual reserve additions by the annual production net asset value nav per share is calculated as before or after tax npv10 plus estimated year end working capital converted from usd to cad as applicable divided by basic shares outstanding at december 31 2019 reserves life index is calculated by dividing the

life has changed substantially for individuals in advanced economies in the first two decades of the 21st century as a result of trends including disruptions in technology globalization the economic crisis of 2008 and its recovery and shifting market and institutional dynamics in many ways changes for individuals have been for the better including new opportunities and overall economic growthâ and the prospect of more to come as the century progresses through developments in science technology and innovation and productivity growth yet the relatively positive perspective on the state of the economy based on gdp and job growth indicators needs to be complemented with a fuller assessment of the economic outcomes for individuals as workers consumers and savers in a report the social contract in the 21st century outcomes so far for workers consumers and savers in advanced economies pdfâ 2 7mb the mckinsey global institute takes an in depth look at these changes in 22 advanced economies in asia europe and north america covering 57 percent of global gdp among the findings while opportunities for work have expanded and employment rates have risen to record levels in many countries work polarization and income stagnation are real and widespread the cost of many discretionary goods and services has fallen sharply but basic necessities such as housing healthcare and education are absorbing an ever larger proportion of incomes coupled with wage stagnation effects this is eroding the welfare of the bottom three quintiles of the population by income level roughly 500 million people in 22 countries public pensions are being scaled backâ and roughly the same three quintiles of the population do not or cannot save enough to make up the difference these shifts point to an evolution in the â social contractâ the arrangements and expectations often implicit that govern the exchanges between individuals and institutions broadly individuals have had to assume greater responsibility for their economic outcomes while many have benefited from this evolution for a significant number of individuals the changes are spurring uncertainty pessimism and a general loss of trust in institutions policy makers business leaders and individuals will need to focus on two fronts the first is sustaining and expanding the gains achieved through continued economic and productivity growth business dynamism investment in economies technology and innovation and continued focus on job growth and opportunity creation the second is tackling the challenges individuals face especially those most affected leaders are beginning to respond to these opportunities and challenges to varying degrees however more is needed given the scale of the opportunities and challenges if the outcomes for the next 20 or more years of the 21st century are to be better than the first 20 and increase broad prosperity part 1 employment has risen but labor markets are polarized and wages have stagnated despite the 2008 financial crisis the first two decades of the 21st century have seen work opportunities expand and employment participation rise to record levels in most countries the share of the working age population in employment has risen strongly in our 22 sample countries to a high of 71 percent in 2018 45 million more working age people were employed than in 2000 exhibit 1 while opportunities for work have expanded and employment rates have risen to record levels in many countries work polarization and income stagnation are real and widespread alternative work arrangements have gained in prominence typically in the form of self employment temporary work part time work workplace fissuring or zero hour contracts such arrangements have enabled greater labor market participation part time paid work was the primary driver of the increase in overall employment between 2000 and 2018 its share rose in 18 out of 21 countries by an average of 4 1 percentage points equivalent to 29 million jobs while that of full time employment declined by 1 4 percentage points labor markets opportunities expanded particularly strongly for women of the 45 million additional workers since 2000 31 million are women female employment increased by 6 3 percentage points between 2000 and 2018 the growth in female employment in this period is seen almost everywhere except norway and the united states where it has declined by 1 3 and 2 2 percentage points respectively some 14 million additional male workers were employed during this period although their share of the working age population fell by 0 4 percentage points on average 1 new work opportunities have benefited high skill high wage workers and low skill low wage workers relative to the middle that has been squeezed between 2000 and 2018 the number of people in middle skill middle wage occupations dropped by seven million in 16 european countries and the united states although this trend has been slowing in the united states wage stagnation has been a persistent challenge for many workers exhibit 2 between 2000 and 2018 average wages grew just 0 7 percent per year across 22 countries although wage growth was positive in 20 out of 22 countries the growth rate was less than one percent over 18 years and less than half the average annual gdp growth of 1 6 percent during the same period 2 median equivalized net income grew even more slowly than wages by just 0 4 percent between 2000 and 2018 annually indicating unequal wage growth across income groups relative poverty rates even after taxes and transfers rose between 2000 and 2016 the share of the working age population earning less than 50 percent of household median income increased from 11 percent to 13 percent over that period equivalent to 14 million additional people across the 22 countries work is changing in part because of global trends such as technological innovation and globalization going forward climate changeâ may also have an effect on work and other economic aspects of the social contract across the united states and 15 european countries between 20 and 30 percent of the working age population or more than 160 million people now engage in independent work with a growing proportion leveraging digital platforms to do so about 70 percent say they do so out of choice technological innovation has also created new types of workâ that did not previously exist from drivers on ride sharing apps and big data translators to professional video gamers and social media influencers accompanying these disruptive trends is a shift in institutional arrangements that made labor markets more flexible and increased the responsibility of individual workers for their own employment and wage outcomes for example employment protection that governs the dismissal of regular workers and hiring of temporary workers has been shown by oecd research to have decreased over the past two decades wage negotiation mechanisms have also been changing the share of workers governed by collective agreements declined in 15 out of 22 countries from 44 percent to 38 percent on average with the most significant declines in countries including germany greece and the united kingdom part 2 for consumers discretionary goods and services are cheaper but housing and other basics are more expensive while the cost of discretionary goods and services has been falling the cost of basicsâ especially housing which accounts for 24 percent of household consumptionâ has risen much faster than general consumer prices and is absorbing a substantial part of householdsâ income exhibit 3 3 prices for clothing communication furnishing and recreation are falling relative to general consumer prices in all regions holding all else constant the average person can work six fewer weeks a year and still consume the same amount of these categories as in 2000 technology has helped unlock new consumption in discretionary categories some of it taking the form of â freeâ services for consumers such as social media communication and information services the combination of falling prices and improving quality has led to an increase in consumer surplus the wedge between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay for goods and services globalization has increased competition in traded goods such as clothing and electronic goods leading to significant price improvements china vietnam and other emerging economies have become key lower cost manufacturing centers and this has both driven down prices and increased offerings to consumers institutional moves to deregulate markets for some discretionary goods and the reduction of trade barriers to allow for greater competition have played a role in improving economic outcomes for consumers between 2000 and 2013 the oecd index for product market regulation fell across all sectors trackedâ telecommunications transportation and utilitiesâ and by 33 percent on average for 22 advanced economies overall price declines were steepest in markets that are most exposed to technology globalization and deregulation such as communications unlike many discretionary goods the cost of housing healthcare and education have risen faster than general consumer prices across countries in our sample meaning that a higher share of income would need to be spent for the same consumption level holding all else constant consumers across ten countries in our sample on average would have to work an additional four weeks a year to consume the same amount of housing healthcare and education that they did two decades ago housing is the primary cause of this loss in purchasing power in most countries housing costs have increased significantly in almost all 20 countries for which data is available accounting for 39 percent of the change on average across 15 european countries and the united states between 2002 and 2018 holding all else constant consumers across ten countries in our sample on average would have to work an additional four weeks a year to consume the same amount of housing healthcare and education that they did two decades ago healthcare prices increased sharply in the united states where it explained 17 percent of the change in consumer prices in europe healthcare constituted just three percent of the change education costs have jumped in all countries except japan and almost doubled in the united kingdom partly due to cuts in university fee subsidies that started in 2010 however education accounts for just two percent of total consumption spending on average in 22 countries the increase in housing healthcare and education spending for consumers absorbed income gains to varying degrees in ten of our 22 countries between 2000 and 2017 in countries where incomes increased the largest erosion of 107 percent of incremental income was in the united kingdom meaning that the gains in income have been entirely absorbed by increased spending on basic goods and services in france these price increases absorbed 87 percent of income gains in countries where incomes did not increaseâ in italy japan and spainâ the rising spend on basics further eroded incomes by 6 to 29 percent part 3 individual and institutional savings have declined at a time when they matter even more increasing longevity and the decline in birth rates are making saving for retirement both a greater imperative and a greater challenge while access and variety of saving and investment options have expanded many households are not saving at all and median wealth growth has been falling as people live longer the number of expected years spent in retirement across our 22 sample countries has increased from 16 in 1980 to 20 in 2018 these gains and expansions in productive working life are a hallmark of progress in the 21st century yet they also pose a considerable challenge for both institutional and individual savers institutional pensions whether public sector or employer provided will need to deal with higher pension pay outs and lower receipts even after accounting for longer working age individual savers will need to save more for themselves for their longer lives and compensate for the shortfall in institutional saving real median net wealth has not recovered in 13 countries since the financial crisis it declined from 104 371 to 80 659 on average in our 22 sample countries between 2007 and 2018 in response about half of oecd countries have raised the statutory retirement age and some including denmark finland italy and the netherlands and sweden now explicitly link the retirement age to life expectancy by 2060 the normal retirement age will approach 66 which represents an increase of 1 5 years for men and 2 1 years for women life expectancy has been increasing at a faster rate governments and private sector institutions concerned about fiscal sustainability have taken action over the past two decades to shift a larger responsibility to individuals for their own retirement savings the net pension replacement rate that an average worker can expect to receive from her or his mandatory pension has decreased by 11 percentage points for the average person in our 22 country sample exhibit 4 net replacement rates which measure how effectively a pension system provides a retirement income to replace average earnings now range from 92 percent in italy to just 28 percent in the united kingdom 4 many pension schemes have changed from defined benefit plans for which institutions guarantee a minimum return and thus bear the market risk to defined contribution ones for which individuals bear the market risk to compensate for the extended period in retirement and decreasing institutional savings in most countries household private savings would need to increase however with widespread stagnation in wage and income growth in many economies and aggregate declines in some the household saving rate has fallen in one half of our sample countries by almost 6 percentage points since 2000 moreover surveys show that more than half of individuals did not save for old age last year and a quarter did not save any money at all real median net wealth has not recovered in 13 countries since the financial crisis it declined from 104 371 to 80 659 on average in our 22 sample countries between 2007 and 2018 and has only just started to rise again inflation adjusted growth in mean net wealth has also been sluggish since the crisis annual growth has been close to zero for most of the post crisis period the proportion of individuals with zero or negative net worth has risen significantly in recent decades in the united states for example the share of households with zero or negative net worth rose to 23 percent in 2017 from 16 percent in 2001 part 4 institutions have shifted responsibility for outcomes to individuals along with disruptive global trends and slow gdp growth a shifting social contract is affecting these outcomes through the changing roles of public and private sector institutions and interventions that shape individual or institutional responsibility for economic outcomes our research suggests that in 19 out of 22 countries institutions are intervening less in the marketplace while governments in 18 out of 22 countries have somewhat stepped up their spending exhibit 5 5 some of the biggest changes in the extent of market intervention are a decline in employment protection for workers on temporary contracts a substantial reduction in product market regulations and a sharp fall in the net replacement rate for mandatory pensions in terms of public sector spending the biggest change came from pensions for which public spending across the 22 countries rose by 1 9 percentage points on average this in turn was almost entirely a function of demographic change as people live longer healthcare spending also rose by 1 1 percentage points and about 30 percent is explained by aging these findings are broadly consistent across countries regardless of their institutional setup we identified three groups 1 countries where market intervention is high and public spending is also high such as austria belgium france and scandinavian countries 2 countries where intervention is high and public spending middling such as germany and the netherlands and 3 countries where market intervention is lower and public spending is also relatively low this latter set includes japan south korea switzerland and the united kingdom and united states part 5 outcomes for workers consumers and savers vary by socioeconomic groups bringing together the evolution of economic outcomes across the three arenas and the changing institutional role we find considerable variation among social and economic groups high skill high income individuals have fared well economic outcomes for the top two quintiles of the population by income and wealth levels have improved since 2000 the employment share of approximately 115 million high skill high wage workers in europe and the united states has risen strongly by almost four percentage points since 2000 and their compensation has also grown savings rates for high income groups as a share of disposable income and their overall share of total wealth have risen middle skill middle income workers have been squeezed out of the labor market roughly 120 million middle skill middle wage jobs in europe and the united states have been â hollowed out â as jobs in this segment declineâ although recent data suggest a slight recovery for mid wage workers in the united states consumption and savings outcomes have been worse for many low skill low income individuals some 95 million low skill low wage individuals in europe and the united states have been especially affected even though their employment share has risen the share of total income for the bottom two quintiles declined by 1 2 percentage points between 2000 and 2017 from 20 4 to 19 2 as consumers lower income groups have been especially hard hit particularly by the housing market the biggest deterioration has been in their capacity to save median savings for the lowest wealth quintile as a share of disposable income dropped by 14 percent on average in germany spain sweden and the united kingdom the share of total wealth of the bottom 60 percent already very low at 7 6 percent has fallen to 7 3 percent young people have fared less well than the elderly the young 15 to 30 who make up around 180 million individuals across our sample countries have difficulty obtaining well paid high quality jobs and also have a harder time climbing on the housing ladder with much lower wealth than their peers two decades ago exhibit 6 compounding the problem is the rising cost of housing the cost of a minimally acceptable house is 23 percent of incomes for young people versus 14 percent for adults and over 65 by contrast old age relative poverty is falling almost everywhere women have seen improvements but still lag men over two thirds of job growth from 2000 to 2018 is attributable to women and the number of working women rose from 175 to 206 million yet they are still behind the share of working women increased from 44 to 46 percent but has yet to attain parity the gender pay gap narrowed from 80 to 85 cents for every dollar a man earns it ranges from a low of 96 cents in belgium to a high of 65 cents in south korea as savers women have a median level of net wealth that is just 62 percent of menâ s in eight european countries although the gap narrowed in the last two decades 6 minorities continue to face challenges in some countries such as the united states families struggling the most tend to be black or hispanicâ the wealth of the median white family was ten times higher than the wealth of the median black family and 7 5 times higher than the median hispanic family in 2016 moreover automation trends may be widening the racial wealth gap african americans may have a higher rate of job displacement part 6 adapting the social contract for the 21st century to achieve better and more inclusive outcomes for individuals in the next decades of the century we identify 10 key challenges which affect large numbers of individuals and which are likely to persist unless addressed given current trends persistent income polarization and wage stagnation wage stagnation has mostly affected those in middle skill middle wage occupations roughly 200 million people in the 22 countries what can be done to enable a higher share of income going to labor work fragility and transition supports employment related risks are rising and employment protection is on the wane partly because of the increase in alternative work arrangement with automation between 40 and 150 million workers may need to switch job categoriesâ in advanced economies how can flexible dynamic labor markets be supported while also reducing fragility for workers challenge of affordable housing roughly 165 million in the 22 countries are overburdened by housing costs which have risen significantly faster than inflation in many markets the housing challenge also has cascading effects on individuals as workers what could be done to unlock supply and other constraints rising expense of and growing demand for healthcare and education rising healthcare and education costs significantly affect more than 125 million individuals who spend more than ten percent of their outlays on healthcare and education as well as the almost 245 million people who are primarily supported by public budgets how can technology and the competitive dynamics that benefited discretionary goods and services be harnessed to make healthcare and education more affordable the growing savings and retirement problem in a century of longer life expectancy and aging how can the capacity and incentives for individuals to save more and more effectively be expanded the multiple pressures on low income individuals low income groups who make up roughly 335 million in the 22 countries face difficulties across all three arenas of work consumption and saving and their position has grown more precarious than it was in 2000 how can social safety nets and other supports be revamped for the current era and set of challenges what market based mechanisms can be established to assist them a new era of challenging outcomes for the under 30 generation young people between 15 and 30 years old have less access to well paid stable employment affordable housing and decent savings compared to previous generations what can be done to support them the persistent gender and race gaps although more than 205 million working women have made strides in the labor market they continue to lag behind men in terms of employment wages savings and overall wealth similarly the racial wealth gap in some countries such as minorities who constitute 90 million people in the united states is both persistent and growing how can opportunities presented by the future of work be harnessed to narrow the gap the growing challenges of place certain regions and local economies mostly in southern europe and in declining industrial areas in the united statesâ have not recovered fully from the global financial crisis what can be done to better integrate regional labor markets into the growing economy the risk of unsustainable government funding tax collection and government revenue generation is not keeping pace with government spending which has risen to support individuals cope with global trends what can be done to ensure the sustainability of these public budgets some institutionsâ public private and socialâ and individuals are starting to adapt and take action in the private sector one sign of a broader reappraisal was given by the business roundtable a group of ceos of major us companies in august 2019 it announced that its members are redefining the purpose of a corporation to care and deliver value for employees customers suppliers and communities as they do with shareholders the social sector and other forms of institutions including philanthropic foundations and faith based charities are also playing a larger role in addressing some of the key challenges families are helping their younger members with education and housing in the united kingdom parents supporting their children are ranked the 10th largest mortgage lender finally individuals themselves are changing their behavior in light of these changes to the social contract many workers are opting for independent work as their primary source of income or to supplement their existing income automation requires new and different workforce skills and individuals today have many more possibilities to prepare themselves and improve their skills or learn new ones than they used to for example courses on online platforms are increasingly accessible others are engaging in lifelong learning to stay ahead most of these efforts seem early localized and relatively small in scale and scope compared to the extent of the challenges moreover many have yet to fully take into account the effect of factors including climate change likely to impact work and other economic aspects of the social contract therefore concerted action is needed on two fronts first to make sure that the gains of the 21st century so far are sustained and scaled and the potential for even more opportunities and economic prosperity is fully realized second to make sure that the outcomes for individuals in the next 20 or more years of the 21st century are better and more inclusive than in the first 20 and increase broad prosperity

to market capabilities we are optimistic about our first acquisition in asia and we see many opportunities to further cultivate the brand globally as consumer interest in skincare continues to expand our momentum continued in the first three weeks of january but as you all know the global environment has changed meaningfully following the outbreak of the coronavirus our thoughts are with

citizens of china during this difficult time and i look forward to my next trip there hopefully in the near future although it is difficult to anticipate the full impact of the coronavirus on our business we expect the next couple of months will be very challenging chinese consumers in many big cities are staying home and retailers are closing stores or limiting hours in an effort to help contain the spread of the virus additionally global travel is being restricted and the effect is being felt beyond china into major travel retail corridors and large tourist cities given what we know

d investment in the market in order to drive bold breakthrough prestige beauty innovation for china the asia pacific region and the rest of the world reflecting china leadership in science we will

progress toward stabilization of the business we leaned into our multiple engines of growth leveraging our successful skin care and fragrance franchises during the holiday season in light of industry

and drive conversion when tourism and travel resume following containment of the coronavirus we anticipate that pretail will continue to start another important highlight this quarter was the publication of our 2019 citizenship and sustainability report last march we announced new goals and the report details our vision and progress one of our goals is to promote ingredient transparency across our brands and aveda led the way with an ingredient glossary on its websites other brands will soon follow innovation is the core of our company once again helped drive our performance

received by consumers globally and these important franchises have high loyalty we are pleased by our strong start in the first half we are now focused on managing effectively throughout the coronavirus outbreak we are determined to serve our consumers in the best ways possible we believe that the efforts of china s government along with leadership from around the world to contain the outbreak will prove effective i want to thank our employees worldwide through their extraordinary efforts working through this challenging time while supporting each other our consumers the communities where we work and our business their grace and agility are a testament to our company culture now i will turn the call over to tracy tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer thank you fabrizio and good morning everyone certainly our thoughts and best wishes are with everyone managing through a very difficult situation in china and globally we are committed to supporting our employees and other stakeholders while we also manage the business impact as best we can during this time as a reminder my commentary today is adjusted for the items that rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency we acquired have be the owner of the dr jart brand toward the end of december the results for the new brand will be recorded in future periods on a one month lag so you can expect operating results from dr jart to be reflected in our fiscal third quarter for the first time including the impact of purchase accounting and the interest expense on the debt we issued largely to fund this acquisition so starting with the quarter results net sales for the second quarter rose 16 driven by strong growth in our international regions and improvement in north america sales growth in asia travel retail and online continued to exceed our expectations from a geographic standpoint our asia pacific region net sales rose 30 with broad based growth across the region sales in greater china accelerated rising very strong double digits our sales in mainland china continued to deliver broad based growth across cities brands categories and channels and our brands saw record results on singles day as expected sales in hong kong declined more than 20 among developed markets in apac we again delivered in apac we again delivered double digit sales growth in korea this quarter our sales in japan rose mid single digits despite the october 1st vat increase last year that contributed to double digit growth last quarter and emerging markets and southeast asia grew high single digits led by thailand net sales in our europe the middle east and africa region rose 18 with most markets contributing to growth our global travel retail business rose strong double digits driven largely by like door growth the continued rapid development of online pre ordering and the successful introduction of newer brands like le labo and kilian emerging markets in the region grew double digits led by india and russia western european markets grew low to mid single digits led by italy iberia and germany net sales in the americas rose 1 a significant improvement from last quarter skin care and fragrance showed good growth driven by estee lauder origins and la mer as well as strong holiday performances from jo malone and tom ford initial shipments of estee lauder s new futurist hydra rescue moisturizing makeup launch helped to partially offset the overall continued weakness in the makeup category in north america sales rose high single digits across all our online channels our sales in the specialty multi channel grew double digits while the brick and mortar department store business remain challenged from a category standpoint skin care once again led growth this quarter net sales accelerated to 28 growth with strong contributions from estee lauder la mer origins and clinique innovations such as estee lauder advanced night repair intense reset concentrate la mer the regenerating serum and clinique id bb gel contributed incremental sales and supported their hero franchises net sales in makeup grew 7 led by estee lauder tom ford and bobbi brown solid innovation and support in foundation and lip products as well as special holiday sets and products drove growth in the category sales of fragrances grew 9 driven by strong holiday activations at jo malone london and the launch of metallique from tom ford fragrance sales grew across all regions but were strongest in the americas and in asia our hair care sales rose 5 driven by the launch of the nutriplenish line of products from aveda and improvement at bumble and bumble our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year favorable pricing and mix was partially offset by the impact of the incremental tariffs and higher obsolescence costs operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 130 basis points we continued to leverage higher sales and greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs to fund advertising and strategic investments in technology and other capabilities operating income rose 23 and operating margin increased by 150 basis points adjusted diluted eps of 2 11 increased 21 compared to the prior year and the currency translation impact was negligible eps was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth as well as disciplined expense management and was partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate during the quarter we acquired the remaining stake in have be the korean based skin care company the transaction resulted in a one time gain of 576 million primarily related to the remeasurement of our previously held minority equity investment to fair value we also recorded 777 million of impairment charges related to three of our four makeup brands a reflection of the continued challenges in the makeup category that have been most prevalent in north america while the market momentum for makeup has slowed in the near term as we have previously discussed the growth opportunities and the strategic value of these brands remains compelling as evidenced by our increased share and capability in specialty multi retail the enhanced social media expertise of the brand and an increased consumer base of gen z and millennials turning now to cash flow for the six months we generated 1 26 billion in net cash flows from operating activities which was roughly flat with the prior year higher earnings were offset primarily by the timing and level of accounts payable we invested 291 million in capital expenditures with cash and 1 04 billion to acquire the remaining equity interest in have be which was funded with debt we also continued to return cash to stockholders by utilizing 813 million to repurchase 4 3 million shares of our stock and 330 million to pay dividends so we ended the first six months of the fiscal year with strong net sales growth of 14 in constant currency and adjusted eps growth of 21 a tremendous reflection of the hard work of our teams as well as strong consumer momentum that we have in our markets so now let s turn to our outlook for the balance of this year with the strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year our multiple engines of growth strategy and the greater financial flexibility and agility we have built into our operating model is expected to help us to effectively manage through the short term disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak due to the rapid escalation and the fluidity of the situation it is both complex and difficult to predict the timing and the corresponding impact on our business therefore we are not giving explicit guidance for the third quarter we also remain mindful that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions and continued challenges in hong kong s retail environment could impact our second half results for the year for the fiscal year we now strive to achieve net sales growth of at least 6 to 8 in constant currency this range is before the impact of 1 point of growth from the inclusion of sales from have be currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point reflecting weighted average rates of 1 10 for the euro 1 27 for the pound and 7 03 for the yuan for the fiscal year with this sales guidance eps is expected to range between 5 60 and 5 70 before restructuring and other charges this includes approximately 0 05 of dilution from currency translation and 0 18 dilution from the have be acquisition in constant currency we expect eps growth of 6 to 8 excluding the dilution from have be eps growth is expected to be at least 9 to 11 which remains in line with our long term objectives for the second half net sales are expected to increase approximately 1 to 2 in constant currency currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point and the inclusion of have be is expected to add 2 percentage points in terms of the cadence throughout the second half we have anticipated the greatest negative sales impact from the coronavirus to be in the third quarter followed by a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter we are severely curtailing discretionary costs while continuing to support critical areas of growth leading beauty forward has reduced our percentage of fixed cost in our operations which gives us greater agility to manage more effectively with slowing sales we expect the belt tightening to have the maximum benefit in the fourth quarter eps is forecast between 1 86 and 1 91 before restructuring charges this includes approximately 0 03 dilution from currency and 0 17 dilution from have be which includes some impact from the coronavirus outbreak purchase accounting and interest expense on the debt issuance as i mentioned previously while our outlook for the balance of this year is uncertain we do remain quite optimistic about the long term growth opportunities for the company we believe we can manage through this difficult health crisis while maintaining the agility to invest as needed and regain our momentum once the recovery is established on behalf of the entire estee lauder companies we extend our deepest well wishes to those who have been affected and thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this period particularly our incredibly hard working and wonderful team in china and that concludes our prepared remarks we ll be happy to take your questions at this time questions and answers operator the floor is now open for questions our first question today comes from dara mohsenian with morgan stanley please go ahead dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys so just was hoping for a bit more clarity on the coronavirus and how you guys are thinking about the potential impact longer term i guess what we ve seen with past epidemics is usually beauty demand has come back pretty quickly after a couple of quarters i know there s not a lot of visibility here and the duration of the illness is obviously still a big wildcard but just for retail any initial thoughts or context on if you think this could be an issue that impairs longer term growth as we look out over the next few years you talked about a gradual recovery through fiscal year end should we expect things to sort of ramp up pretty quickly after that or how are you thinking about it in terms of longevity of impact thanks fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer so obviously we don t know about the specific medical health recovery timing which is the unknown at this point but we are in agreement with your assumption which is basically this will have a impact in the short term and definition of short term is what is unknown today but then after this period there will be a recovery and people will come gradually back to normal habits and so we do expect to recover our momentum at the end of the health crisis and in terms of our assumption today are in line with what you said we assume the two quarters to be affected by the impact and we expect a normalization in fiscal year 21 that s our assumption today the other important thing is that we are ready to stay close to the current mitigation of the issue and resolution of the health crisis as we are doing supporting our china team in all the activities that the government is putting in place in china today and we also will stand ready to support the recovery when the recovery will be happening and to invest behind the recovery as required by the market opportunity but most importantly by the needs of rebuilding the right consumption of chinese consumers in the name of economical development of china dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst great that s helpful thank you operator the next question will come from lauren lieberman with barclays please go ahead lauren lieberman barclays analyst great thanks good morning i was hoping we d talk actually a little bit about the americas because the strength this quarter the inflection was very notable so i was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how much you think this is tied to just being really proactive in promoting in getting behind it i should say excuse me fragrance and skin and holiday being the key to this or are you starting to see other lift that you thinking can carry through past holiday and then in part with that of course we ve had the news about incremental macy s door closures this week so if you can just comment on the outlook for the rest of the year in the americas thanks fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer so first of all in as we said this quarter has contributed to the stabilization of our north america business and this has been in line with the strategy we communicated in investor day and we remain commitment to continue the work of stabilization in the next months so what happened this quarter is first of all we have used as anticipated much more granular insight in the market to activate our plans and much more local relevance in the activation the other thing that happened we have recognized the softness of the overall makeup market and that s why we have accelerated our activity in skin care and particularly fragrances during the holiday season that were well fitting the situation and we got great results so we have if you want adjusted our engines of growth in a way that contributed to the good results our innovation pipeline as anticipated has been strong and the impact of innovation has improved and so all these have been a positive impact we will continue to operate in that direction but we do have still to be confront some of the headwinds to be clear the makeup softness particularly the color makeup soft is continuing as you mentioned the closures of certain retailing stores where we do have high market share will continue although we completely share the macy s strategy of focusing on the high performance doors and are gradually stopping the smaller and lower performance doors with as i said we support this strategy but obviously we will need to operate with the strategy making sure that we retain the consumer the brands and this will be difficult but we will do our best to do that so we need to take under account our extraordinary efforts to improve our model that are working but also take on under account there will continue to be headwinds so our strategy remains at this point stabilization lauren lieberman barclays analyst great and just as a follow up how are you thinking about the impact of chinese travelers not really visiting the u s over the next several months just in terms of the outlook fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer that s actually a good point we assume that there will be obviously an important reduction of chinese travelers not visiting the u s in the next at least two three months and this will have a negative impact obviously on the sales to chinese students frankly in this moment we are assuming in our guidance also a slow down on any travel population to be clear in this moment because of the coronavirus global concern tourists in general is being reduced temporary so we are taking the assumption of this temporary reduction under account in our guidance lauren lieberman barclays analyst okay thanks so much tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer and i just want to add as it relates to our guidance i mentioned the range of 1 82 to 1 91 which is what s in our press release i think i ve mentioned a different number in our guidance for the second half operator the next question is from michael binetti with credit suisse please go ahead michael binetti credit suisse analyst hey guys thanks for taking our question and congrats on a really good quarter so i want to ask you on the dr jart dilution could you walk us through how much the 0 18 we re trying to think forward i guess over the four quarters of integrating that business how much of that is one time in nature and when you see that starting to wear off or even possibly turn to an accretive position and then i just i want to ask you as you think through the u s number a little bit so do you think the retailers that you worked with on the holiday strategy to get more skin care and fragrance out there they really seem to want to keep pushing on makeup even as the warning signs were showing up over the last year or two do you think they ve gone through the psychological change yet that skin care is going to be the driver for the medium term and are they accepting that they have to pull back more on makeup in a structural way i guess are the gains you saw in skin care and fragrance would you characterize those as sticky and shelf space gains that are going to remain dedicated to those categories as we look into calendar 2020 tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer yes so starting with have be dilution we obviously have the step up in inventory which is one time depends on how you re treating the interest expense which is also in that number what i would say michael is that we expect that have be will be if you think forward relatively flat including purchase accounting so eliminating those one time items next year and accretive the following year michael binetti credit suisse analyst okay tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer the makeup question is the second question fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer yeah sorry could you repeat who was the subject of the makeup question when you said they i didn t understand michael binetti credit suisse analyst well it sounds like it was a pretty meaningful acceleration obviously in north america or in america we can see your numbers but it sounds like the number that you got from specialty multi which was a great growth channel for you guys over the last few years but slowed recently it sounds like it improved a lot this quarter and it sounds like you worked with them on skin care and i m just wondering if you feel like that channel they feel like they ve gone through the mental change of saying look skin care is going to be the bigger driver and we re going to give them give that category more shelf space that sticks around calendar 20 fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer frankly yes i think everyone realized the power of skin care in this moment and we are all working together to leverage the power of skin care also because skin care for instant results and skin care product combined with makeup is on a growth so there are yeah you speak about shelf space which obviously is a bit more gradual in the way it changes but definitely innovation programs are reflecting a lot of this so there is more activity more social media more advertising in skin care than before and this i think is a reflection on the results by the way makeup is a big category the makeup for face meaning foundation for example is still doing very very well the place which is softer is color and importantly what we are doing to contribute not only to leverage skin care and fragrances better but to reinstate growth in makeup in the future is we are accelerating the innovation in the makeup category contributing to the future results of our retail partners also in this category so to be clear we are not giving up at all on makeup we are just accepting that in the short term we are focusing more on other category and innovating better in makeup to reactivate the consumer interest michael binetti credit suisse analyst thank you very much congrats on getting north america back to positive fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from erinn murphy with piper sandler please go ahead erinn murphy piper sandler analyst great thanks good morning and let me add my congratulations i guess my question is around amazon there s been some press out recently talking about them potentially evolving their model to launch some luxury brands maybe using a concession model if something like this was to play out would you ever consider or reconsider excuse me amazon as a channel for luxury beauty and then just a follow up on china can you share tracey maybe what percent of physical doors have been shuttered and are you seeing any major change in trend in the online business in china since that outbreak has escalated thank you fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer okay on the first question is the answer is no at this point we are not considering amazon a channel for our luxury beauty products and we are focusing on our current channels and our current partners to build and continue the stabilization in north america business as far as the china question is the the number of physical doors i ll let tracy go with that tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer yeah so as you can imagine it s quite fluid and one of the things that we ve seen is the chinese new year extended for many many of our employees our stores have closed as malls have closed so very recently two thirds of our department store doors were closed and the remaining doors were on reduced hours now that could change next week so this is a very fluid situation fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer and on the second part of the china question which is the online absolutely the online channel is very strong in china and the as we said in the second quarter but in this moment also online is suffering because in this moment in the middle of the outbreak the delivery system in homes and in the big distribution centers also people are not working like in this moment till february 10 many people the non essential activity in factories and other situation this is stopped the same is for distribution centers the same for our activities so online at least in the short term is having the same issues of brick and mortar in term of the role of online in the recovery in the future we are optimistic that online will play a very strong role in the recovery when the recovery will happen erinn murphy piper sandler analyst thank you for that context all the best fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from steve strycula with ubs please go ahead steven strycula ubs analyst hi good morning so first part of my question just wanted to follow up on erinn s question can you give us a little bit more texture as to how do disaggregate how maybe mainland china sales are performing versus the travel retail component of the business primarily as how we think about modeling the back half of the year one of those businesses is housed within the emea segment the other business is clearly housed in apac so just want to get a little bit more texture as to which one is being more impacted real time and then fabrizio if you use history as a guide post here how do we think about once the issue is call it quote unquote contained what is like the recovery path off from that moment forward is it typically from what you ve seen before three or four months for travel retail to come back online from flights being booked any help would be appreciated thanks fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer yeah so the short answer to the first question in this moment travel retail is the most impacted channel because if you think what s just to give you the context of what s happening you will probably know that more than 60 airlines just closed their flights so in this moment the travel in and out of china is suspended in the large majority of cases so there is lack of traffic for just in and out of china second in general tourism in this moment is not prudent because it is a global issue the outbreak it is a global concern and so many people which are concerned to travel in this moment are reducing their choice or postponing some of their travel and i m speaking touristic travel then there is a third factor is many companies have banned travel to china but also to any other place where there is the virus and so business travel has been reduced not to count the many companies are reducing business travel for cost containment reasons so in this moment the amount of travel in airports is reduced and traffic is significantly reduced so that s the biggest impact the second biggest impact is obviously china mainland itself and hong kong which are reduced significant so i would say the greater china area because all the reason that we have already discussed in the prepared remarks that i m not going to repeat but the most important thing is that keep in mind that till february 10 most of the cities are not even people are not back to work until at february children of that school and people are requested rightly so not to get out of home for reason which are not essential and not to go in public transportation where there is a risk of contamination so the behaviors of the entire population is fundamentally changed and because of this is the second area where in the short term we expect an impact the second part of your question is the recovery now the recovery we know what you know we have stated all the previous cases and all the previous situation and what we see that the recovery tends to be a hockey stick meaning when the things is back it is back particularly in the traveling when traffic is back traffic is back and the people buy the thing that we can do more in term of the business learning that we are applying during the period before the recovery in travel retail will be very important to push conversion meaning when there is you know travel retail is built by traffic by conversion conversion is an area where we re making many improvements so in this period of transition where traffic will be low we are reworking our plans to use conversion as a key mitigating element of the dip and then obviously we are preparing for future recovery plans when the time will arrive the last point i want to make is that we will try to tune the recovery to the recovery of the chinese economy the chinese population we don t want just to look this as a business we want to look at this as a contribution to the recovery of the country and really supporting our employees at the country and the same will happen in travel retail where for example some of our customers and retail partners are chinese and we are going to stay close to them to contribute to the recovery of the travel retail business to make sure that our long term retail partners will benefit from the recovery as much as possible and to start this all again to restart the right process and to regain momentum not only for us but for the entire industry operator the next question is from andrea teixeira with jp morgan please go ahead andrea teixeira jp morgan analyst thank you good morning and i just want to echo the congrats on your results fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer thank you andrea teixeira jp morgan analyst so as a follow up on the north america and the commentary you made for mix fabrizio and obviously there was it s natural that in the holidays there s more giftable skin care and fragrances and you are also putting more i think prudently putting more marketing behind those lines so do you think that innovation and momentum continue to build into the next few quarters or we may be potentially had some seasonal positive impact of that into the second quarter thank you tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer so i ll start and then fabrizio can also add his comments we are progressing toward stabilization in north america and clearly it was a strong holiday and strong second quarter for us in north america and in other parts of the globe so our teams have worked awfully hard to make this holiday season a very good one and consumers responded and we re very happy about that as we look at the back half of the year fabrizio touched on the fact that we do have tourists that we expect that that business to be a bit softer given the situation that we re managing through globally and i would also say that north america is making progressive progress however i would not expect that the second quarter would necessarily be reflective of continued acceleration from there but the north america team is executing against all of the strategies that were laid out last year and we re seeing some good outcomes from that so what we told you last quarter was north america we expect certainly to have better performance this year than we did last year in north america so that is progression toward stabilization lauren asked earlier about the macy s announcement and clearly as we ve been saying for some time we believe that brick and mortar needs to be taken out of north america and north america has been over retailed for some time so we are very much aligned with what macy s has announced in their investor day yesterday the doors that actually would be closing in our fiscal year were already included in our guidance andrea teixeira jp morgan analyst thanks helpful operator the next question will come from mark astrachan with stifel please go ahead mark astrachan stifel analyst thanks and good morning everybody i was wondering if you could quantify the online percentage of sales from china and related to that also if you could just quantify the impact benefit from e commerce accelerating consumption the enhanced availability in china in other words previously consumers would have to visit cities selling the products and now you are up to 123 but e commerce obviously makes the product available everywhere so maybe if you could just talk a bit about how you think about that dynamic as having helped partner sales and how you think about that on a go forward basis and maybe if you think about some of those tier 3 to 5 cities which didn t have product readily available but now people can order online how do you think about that in terms of accelerating demand maintaining that demand and kind of how that will impact future growth fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer that is a very good question as i commented other times on the subject this is a very important phenomenon because today we have physical distribution in china in 123 cities with our most distributed brands which are lauder and clinique and much lower city coverage in the other brands which are still on the growth trajectory so there is a lot of physical distribution potential in the long term still untapped but at the same time we know there is demand in china now in over 600 cities so there are over 450 cities where there is strong demand and there is not yet physical distribution of prestige luxury and for sure prestige luxury obviously the lauder brands so this demand gets filled by online and gets filled by when this consumer travel also travel within china like in amazing three tier like hainan island then where they can access the products or when they travel for internal business for vacation like going to beijing or to shanghai so that s the situation but online cover a lot the cities and that s why also is growing and it is very strategic because give us access to these consumers in a very productive way the other important positive consequence of this dynamic is that the brick and mortar can remain very productive can remain very focused where there is the right productivity and online can cover productively the rest so this is a good phenomenon continue to grow it is definitely one of the reason behind my comment that we are having better and better results also in the tier 3 and tier 4 cities also where physical distribution is not yet arrived in term of percentage of sales china is the highest percentage of sales online versus other markets it is on the high side and it s continued to grow operator we have time for one more question and that question will come from nik modi with rbc capital markets nik modi rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks thanks for the question good morning everyone i just wanted to follow up on mark s question fabrizio how much flexibility do you have to turn up the dial on really focusing on some of those lower tier cities that you just referenced i m just thinking about as kind of the year progresses and if you really wanted to turn up the dial to generate sales growth in some of these other tier cities do you have that kind of control in the near term or is it a much longer term burn fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer i mean we have control of the online with our partners like tmall and obviously our own online activity but remember our way to build distribution also to build coverage is we are in luxury and for us selective distribution which means demand ahead of supply is very important so we gradually build the demand and the reason why today demand is growing so fast also in the city is social media because while in the past advertising was local meaning advertising was focused in the cities where there was physical distribution social media by definition is national so you are in a dynamic where demand is normally ahead of supply and that s the typical demand of a good luxury market and we have filled in this demand gradually and making sure that we keep the concept of desirability and high quality and high quality also the experience that we give to our consumer in mind so we are not selling products we are selling quality and full experiences and we only do that when we can provide the best possible service to the consumer so the short answer is gradually but yes we have the capability to dial up as the market opportunity reveals itself nik modi rbc capital markets analyst and just a quick follow up of the 450 cities you cited in china as opportunity how many do you believe estee lauder as a company has a very good handle on demand and just the general consumer insights in those cities fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer i will now give you specific numbers but i can tell you that we have the consumer data so we know the number of consumers that are buying from different cities even we use this data analytics to decide where to open physical distribution so we use the demand and the elements of the strengths of the demand from the cities also to judge our physical distribution strategy to make sure that we continue to provide better high touch services to the consumer when the demand is sufficient to be productive and to offer the quality and the service that we need to offer so it is a gradual development of quality service nik modi rbc capital markets analyst very helpful thank you fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer welcome operator that concludes today s question and answer session if you were unable to join for the entire call a playback will be available at 1 00 pm eastern time today through february

december 31 2019 over the last twenty years we have established ourselves as one of the leading producers of renewable resources globally said sachin shan ceo of brookfield renewable we have built a business where the generation from our 19 000 megawatt fleet avoids approximately 27 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually all while delivering strong compound returns to our unitholders

million brookfield renewable reported ffo growth of 13 leading to 761 million of ffo for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 or 2 45 per unit after deducting non cash depreciation our net loss attributable to unitholders for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was 59 million or 0 19 per unit these results were supported by contributions from recent acquisitions and newly commissioned facilities and execution on our key operating initiatives highlights increased ffo per unit by 13 driven by accretive growth and strong operational performance we continue our track record of strong ffo per unit growth at a 10 annual growth rate since our strategic combination with brookfield s renewable assets in 2011 we advanced key commercial priorities and delivered on cost saving initiatives totaling 40 million globally on an annualized basis 12 million net to bep invested 2 billion 550 million net to bep of equity in nine transactions including doubling the size of our asian and distributed generation businesses adding a leading global solar developer and investing in a hydro portfolio in canada commissioned 50 megawatts of new capacity progressed approximately 2 100 megawatts through construction and advanced stage permitting and increased the size of our development pipeline to approximately 13 000 megawatts maintained our robust investment grade balance sheet ended the year with 2 7 billion of available liquidity and raised approximately 1 4 billion in incremental liquidity through asset sales and strategic upfinancings and announced the creation of a canadian corporation bepc that will provide investors the optionality to invest in bep through either the current partnership or through a corporation which is expected to support the expansion of our investor base update on growth initiatives during the fourth quarter we closed our acquisition of a 50 interest in x elio a leading global solar developer with this acquisition we have significantly enhanced our solar development capabilities adding 972 megawatts of operating assets and almost 6 000 megawatts to our global construction and development pipeline also in the fourth quarter we signed two agreements to acquire 14 solar development projects in brazil with 428 mw of total capacity for total consideration of 120 million 30 million net to bep both these transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and represent attractive additions to our business in brazil with approximately 2 100 mw of capacity across multiple technologies hydro wind and solar furthermore through our interest in terraform power we acquired 44 mw of pv solar assets in spain for 70 million and signed an agreement to acquire 100 mw of solar csp assets in spain located proximate to terraform power s csp plants for 115 million which terraform power expects to close in the first quarter of 2020 operations in 2019 we generated ffo of 761 million a 13 increase over the prior year as the business benefitted from recent acquisitions strong operational performance and execution on margin enhancement initiatives during the year our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of 720 million representing a 7 increase over the prior year our storage segment also performed well generating 27 million of ffo in the year as our portfolio continues to provide critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and backup capacity to increasingly intermittent grids during the year our generation was roughly in line with the long term average as we continue to benefit from the diversity of our fleet our priority over the past decade has been to diversify the business which over the long term mitigates exposure to resource volatility regional or market disruptions and potential credit events we also continued to execute on key contracting initiatives across all our businesses our focus in latin america continues to be on extending the average duration of our power purchase agreements which today stands at 10 years in brazil and 3 years in colombia as well as signing contracts with high quality credit worthy counterparties globally we continue to see increasing value ascribed to the unique scale renewable storage capabilities that hydroelectric assets provide to increasingly intermittent electricity grids for example in colombia we secured 3 million of ancillary services revenues in the united states we qualified to receive the highest tier renewable energy credits for a number of our hydroelectric assets in the northeast which will contribute 3 million to ffo annually and in the u k our first hydro portfolio was the critical link to restarting the grid following a nation wide blackout in august our wind and solar segments generated a combined 274 million of ffo representing an 18 increase over the prior year these portfolios benefitted from contributions from recent growth initiatives including the acquisition of two wind portfolios in asia and through our interest in terraform power a large distributed generation portfolio in the united states and full year contributions from saeta yield a scale european wind and solar portfolio we also benefitted from executing on opportunistic o m outsourcing agreements aimed at de risking the portfolios owned by terraform power and where appropriate delivering cost savings we executed on three such agreements across terraform power and our wind portfolio in brazil a common theme across all these opportunities was attractive availability guarantees and a more comprehensive scope than what was currently in place at terraform power these initiatives will deliver aggregate cost savings of approximately 30 million 9 million net to bep finally we continued to advance our global greenfield development activities including progressing 717 megawatts of construction diversified across distributed and utility scale solar wind storage and hydro in 7 different countries we are also progressing 1 380 megawatts of advanced stage projects through final permitting and contracting and our total greenfield development pipeline now totals approximately 13 000 megawatts of note during the year we signed power purchase agreements for three wind repowering projects in new york and california totaling 220 megawatts and these projects are expected to be commissioned in 2021 environmental social and governance esg reporting we have been owner operators of long duration critical electricity assets for over a century and therefore understand that embedding strong esg practices into our investing and operating activities is essential to preserving capital mitigating risk and creating long term value fundamentally strong esg practices drive further economic value to our business and inherently create higher barriers to entry as such we integrate relevant esg considerations into our investing and operating strategies we are therefore proud to announce that we are publishing our inaugural esg report which among other things illustrates the on the ground work we do to maintain our social license to operate with one of the largest public pure play renewable portfolios globally we are helping to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids additionally maintaining socially responsible practices from health and safety to community relations to biodiversity is a critical component of successful operations over the long term we operate with the highest ethical standards conducting our business with integrity and above compliance with laws and regulations we aim for best practice everywhere we operate esg and sustainability investing continues to gain momentum globally with esg funds expected to rise into the trillions over the next decade we believe our portfolio s inherent environmental attributes coupled with our long standing practices around maintaining a social license to operate provide significant tailwinds to demand growth for brookfield renewable balance sheet and liquidity our liquidity position remains robust with 2 7 billion of total available liquidity at year end during the year we executed on key financing and capital raising initiatives aimed at maintaining robust access to capital a prudent debt maturity ladder and a low risk investment grade balance sheet during the year we executed on more than 6 billion of financings across the business which allowed us to raise 1 billion of incremental liquidity to bep extend our average debt portfolio duration to 10 years and reduce annual interest costs by 15 million 9 million net to bep of note we continue to advance our green financing strategy in order to capitalize on growing demand for carbon free debt products and diversify our debt investor base to date we have issued six green bonds at both the corporate and project levels which all together totaled approximately 2 4 billion during the fourth quarter we also closed our first incentive linked loan as part of our corporate credit facility that will allow us to reduce our cost of borrowing as we continue to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids as demand for sustainability focused investing continues to grow we expect green financings and sustainability linked loans will increasingly become a more prominent funding lever within our business in 2019 we also continued to execute our capital recycling strategy of selling mature de risked or non core assets to lower cost of capital buyers and redeploying the proceeds into higher yielding opportunities during the year we raised almost 600 million 365 million net to bep through this funding strategy allowing us to crystallize an approximate 18 return on our portuguese and northern ireland wind assets and to return more than two times our capital invested in south africa distribution currency option the quarterly distributions payable on brookfield renewable s lp units are declared in u s dollars unitholders resident in

asia and we see many opportunities to further cultivate the brand globally as consumer interest in skincare continues to expand our momentum continued in the first three weeks of january but as you all know the global environment has changed meaningfully following the outbreak of the coronavirus our thoughts are with individuals who have been diagnosed and those who have mourned family and

partners i ve traveled all over to learn more about these beautiful country it s wonderful people my heart goes out to the citizens of china during this difficult time and i look forward to my next trip there hopefully in the near future although it is difficult to anticipate the full impact of the coronavirus on our business we expect the next couple of months will be very challenging chinese consumers in many big cities are staying home and retailers are closing stores or limiting hours in an effort to help contain the spread of the virus additionally global travel is being restricted and the effect is being felt beyond china into major travel retail corridors and large tourist cities given what we know now and our experience with past epidemics we believe our business will gradually recover toward the end of the fiscal year we stand ready to invest to facilitate the recovery as soon as the market supports it leveraging the flexibility of our resource allocation and our multiple growth drivers we remain committed to china and to the chinese consumers for the long term and plan to increase our r d investment in the market in order to drive bold breakthrough prestige beauty

second quarter results the estee lauder brand was again a star in our portfolio the brand grew strong double digit globally in both skincare and makeup and rose in every region powered by its many hero franchises including advanced night repair as well as re nutriv revitalizing supreme micro essence and double wear this is a beautiful example of our multiple engines not only winning across many brands but also within a big brand re nutriv estee lauder luxury skin care line delivered superb results supported by targeted marketing with the luxury consumer enhanced merchandising and desirable innovation looking now at our geographic results sales advanced in every region with strengths across categories in asia pacific virtually every market grew led by china which accelerated generating strong double digit growth as all our brands category and channels advanced we had terrific growth from smaller cities in china which are becoming a greater part of our business and a promising long term growth driver we have expanded into two new cities bringing our total to 123 our online business in china more than doubled elevated by well integrated online and offline campaigns for singles day the estee lauder brand was among tmall best performers for the event while mac la mer and jo malone london each excelled in their respective categories our brand expansion strategy on tmall was a distinct advantage as an example following tom ford beauty launch on tmall in 2019 the brand executed its first singles day to tremendous success in both fragrance and makeup its performance was twice that of its tmall launch day which was our biggest launch ever on the platform chinese consumer interest in prestige fragrance category is rising we are nicely position with our wide portfolio of luxury fragrances jo malone london and tom ford beauty excelled in the quarter helping to further diversify our business in china we plan to launch additional luxury fragrance there later this year we delivered strong growth in our other emerging market outside of china led by terrific results in russia india thailand and brazil in the quarter we continued to invest for growth and attract new consumers for example brazil is the fourth largest market globally for hair care and we launched aveda our 10th brand there we are showcasing the brand historical commitment to sustainability the environment and botanically based product with a salon in sao paulo that includes sustainable elements across europe the middle east and africa estee lauder mac clinique and la mer our four biggest brands prospered demonstrating the appeal of established brands that have broad exposure to multiple sub categories and compelling innovation every category advanced in the region our skin care brand led the growth which sought after newness from la mer darphin and origins the u k grew modestly for the second consecutive quarter in a difficult environment and several of our brands gained share our growth strategy is showing promise amid macro industry specific headwinds in north america we made good progress toward stabilization of the business we leaned into our multiple engines of growth leveraging our successful skin care and fragrance franchises during the holiday season in light of industry challenges in makeup there were several bright spots brand representing about half of our sales grew and we had gains in the specialty multi and online channels in fact la mer delivered record black friday sales on its own sites driven by unique product assortment and influencer led holiday campaign as we work to rejuvenate the makeup business in north america we are creating products that leverage consumer insights from our enhanced data analytics for example we learned consumers want products that combine skin care benefits with makeup in response the estee lauder brand just launched futurist hydra rescue a new moisturizing foundation combining the positioning of our winning futurist franchise in china with consumer needs in north america the launch is off to a very strong start with high ratings and reviews looking now at the channels our global online business delivered stellar results our brand sites third party sites and retailer sites all grew double digit with broad based strength across the regions our online business was vibrant globally around cyber monday as our brands offered well received products and set in the important holiday gifting giving season we continue to invest in our excellent growth prospects online we launched our brands on more third party sites which are rising in popularity deployed new digital payment technologies across several of our brand sites in the u s and expanded our loyalty programs with reach and engaging content we have increased the time consumers spent on our brand sites and traffic has grown increasing the inherent media value these sites provide travel retail also continued its momentum our top 8 brands grew double digits at retail with strength in skin care and our luxury and our seasonal fragrance brands grew strongly aided by expanded distribution in the channel innovative pre retail campaign unique retailers activation and effective advertising all contributed to fantastic results the pretail segment of travel retail excelled in the quarter and is becoming an increasingly important part of our business pretail enabled us to engage with consumers before the travel build brand equity and desirability and drive conversion when tourism and travel resume following containment of the coronavirus we anticipate that pretail will continue to start another important highlight this quarter was the publication of our 2019 citizenship and sustainability report last march we announced new goals and the report details our vision and progress one of our goals is to promote ingredient transparency across our brands and aveda led the way with an ingredient glossary on its websites other brands will soon follow innovation is the core of our company once again helped drive our performance accounting for over 25 of sales we have exciting innovation from our four biggest brands coming in the second half of our fiscal year many in the hero franchises we believe these launches will be well received by consumers globally and these important franchises have high loyalty we are pleased by our strong start in the first half we are now focused on managing effectively throughout the coronavirus outbreak we are determined to serve our consumers in the best ways possible we believe that the efforts of china s government along with leadership from around the world to contain the outbreak will prove effective i want to thank our employees worldwide through their extraordinary efforts working through this challenging time while supporting each other our consumers the communities where we work and our business their grace and agility are a testament to our company culture now i will turn the call over to tracy tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer thank you fabrizio and good morning everyone certainly our thoughts and best wishes are with everyone managing through a very difficult situation in china and globally we are committed to supporting our employees and other stakeholders while we also manage the business impact as best we can during this time as a reminder my commentary today is adjusted for the items that rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency we acquired have be the owner of the dr jart brand toward the end of december the results for the new brand will be recorded in future periods on a one month lag so you can expect operating results from dr jart to be reflected in our fiscal third quarter for the first time including the impact of purchase accounting and the interest expense on the debt we issued largely to fund this acquisition so starting with the quarter results net sales for the second quarter rose 16 driven by strong growth in our international regions and improvement in north america sales growth in asia travel retail and online continued to exceed our expectations from a geographic standpoint our asia pacific region net sales rose 30 with broad based growth across the region sales in greater china accelerated rising very strong double digits our sales in mainland china continued to deliver broad based growth across cities brands categories and channels and our brands saw record results on singles day as expected sales in hong kong declined more than 20 among developed markets in apac we again delivered in apac we again delivered double digit sales growth in korea this quarter our sales in japan rose mid single digits despite the october 1st vat increase last year that contributed to double digit growth last quarter and emerging markets and southeast asia grew high single digits led by thailand net sales in our europe the middle east and africa region rose 18 with most markets contributing to growth our global travel retail business rose strong double digits driven largely by like door growth the continued rapid development of online pre ordering and the successful introduction of newer brands like le labo and kilian emerging markets in the region grew double digits led by india and russia western european markets grew low to mid single digits led by italy iberia and germany net sales in the americas rose 1 a significant improvement from last quarter skin care and fragrance showed good growth driven by estee lauder origins and la mer as well as strong holiday performances from jo malone and tom ford initial shipments of estee lauder s new futurist hydra rescue moisturizing makeup launch helped to partially offset the overall continued weakness in the makeup category in north america sales rose high single digits across all our online channels our sales in the specialty multi channel grew double digits while the brick and mortar department store business remain challenged from a category standpoint skin care once again led growth this quarter net sales accelerated to 28 growth with strong contributions from estee lauder la mer origins and clinique innovations such as estee lauder advanced night repair intense reset concentrate la mer the regenerating serum and clinique id bb gel contributed incremental sales and supported their hero franchises net sales in makeup grew 7 led by estee lauder tom ford and bobbi brown solid innovation and support in foundation and lip products as well as special holiday sets and products drove growth in the category sales of fragrances grew 9 driven by strong holiday activations at jo malone london and the launch of metallique from tom ford fragrance sales grew across all regions but were strongest in the americas and in asia our hair care sales rose 5 driven by the launch of the nutriplenish line of products from aveda and improvement at bumble and bumble our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year favorable pricing and mix was partially offset by the impact of the incremental tariffs and higher obsolescence costs operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 130 basis points we continued to leverage higher sales and greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs to fund advertising and strategic investments in technology and other capabilities operating income rose 23 and operating margin increased by 150 basis points adjusted diluted eps of 2 11 increased 21 compared to the prior year and the currency translation impact was negligible eps was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth as well as disciplined expense management and was partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate during the quarter we acquired the remaining stake in have be the korean based skin care company the transaction resulted in a one time gain of 576 million primarily related to the remeasurement of our previously held minority equity investment to fair value we also recorded 777 million of impairment charges related to three of our four makeup brands a reflection of the continued challenges in the makeup category that have been most prevalent in north america while the market momentum for makeup has slowed in the near term as we have previously discussed the growth opportunities and the strategic value of these brands remains compelling as evidenced by our increased share and capability in specialty multi retail the enhanced social media expertise of the brand and an increased consumer base of gen z and millennials turning now to cash flow for the six months we generated 1 26 billion in net cash flows from operating activities which was roughly flat with the prior year higher earnings were offset primarily by the timing and level of accounts payable we invested 291 million in capital expenditures with cash and 1 04 billion to acquire the remaining equity interest in have be which was funded with debt we also continued to return cash to stockholders by utilizing 813 million to repurchase 4 3 million shares of our stock and 330 million to pay dividends so we ended the first six months of the fiscal year with strong net sales growth of 14 in constant currency and adjusted eps growth of 21 a tremendous reflection of the hard work of our teams as well as strong consumer momentum that we have in our markets so now let s turn to our outlook for the balance of this year with the strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year our multiple engines of growth strategy and the greater financial flexibility and agility we have built into our operating model is expected to help us to effectively manage through the short term disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak due to the rapid escalation and the fluidity of the situation it is both complex and difficult to predict the timing and the corresponding impact on our business therefore we are not giving explicit guidance for the third quarter we also remain mindful that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions and continued challenges in hong kong s retail environment could impact our second half results for the year for the fiscal year we now strive to achieve net sales growth of at least 6 to 8 in constant currency this range is before the impact of 1 point of growth from the inclusion of sales from have be currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point reflecting weighted average rates of 1 10 for the euro 1 27 for the pound and 7 03 for the yuan for the fiscal year with this sales guidance eps is expected to range between 5 60 and 5 70 before restructuring and other charges this includes approximately 0 05 of dilution from currency translation and 0 18 dilution from the have be acquisition in constant currency we expect eps growth of 6 to 8 excluding the dilution from have be eps growth is expected to be at least 9 to 11 which remains in line with our long term objectives for the second half net sales are expected to increase approximately 1 to 2 in constant currency currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point and the inclusion of have be is expected to add 2 percentage points in terms of the cadence throughout the second half we have anticipated the greatest negative sales impact from the coronavirus to be in the third quarter followed by a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter we are severely curtailing discretionary costs while continuing to support critical areas of growth leading beauty forward has reduced our percentage of fixed cost in our operations which gives us greater agility to manage more effectively with slowing sales we expect the belt tightening to have the maximum benefit in the fourth quarter eps is forecast between 1 86 and 1 91 before restructuring charges this includes approximately 0 03 dilution from currency and 0 17 dilution from have be which includes some impact from the coronavirus outbreak purchase accounting and interest expense on the debt issuance as i mentioned previously while our outlook for the balance of this year is uncertain we do remain quite optimistic about the long term growth opportunities for the company we believe we can manage through this difficult health crisis while maintaining the agility to invest as needed and regain our momentum once the recovery is established on behalf of the entire estee lauder companies we extend our deepest well wishes to those who have been affected and thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this period particularly our incredibly hard working and wonderful team in china and that concludes our prepared remarks we ll be happy to take your questions at this time questions and answers operator the floor is now open for questions our first question today comes from dara mohsenian with morgan stanley please go ahead dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys so just was hoping for a bit more clarity on the coronavirus and how you guys are thinking about the potential impact longer term i guess what we ve seen with past epidemics is usually beauty demand has come back pretty quickly after a couple of quarters i know there s not a lot of visibility here and the duration of the illness is obviously still a big wildcard but just for retail any initial thoughts or context on if you think this could be an issue that impairs longer term growth as we look out over the next few years you talked about a gradual recovery through fiscal year end should we expect things to sort of ramp up pretty quickly after that or how are you thinking about it in terms of longevity of impact thanks fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer so obviously we don t know about the specific medical health recovery timing which is the unknown at this point but we are in agreement with your assumption which is basically this will have a impact in the short term and definition of short term is what is unknown today but then after this period there will be a recovery and people will come gradually back to normal habits and so we do expect to recover our momentum at the end of the health crisis and in terms of our assumption today are in line with what you said we assume the two quarters to be affected by the impact and we expect a normalization in fiscal year 21 that s our assumption today the other important thing is that we are ready to stay close to the current mitigation of the issue and resolution of the health crisis as we are doing supporting our china team in all the activities that the government is putting in place in china today and we also will stand ready to support the recovery when the recovery will be happening and to invest behind the recovery as required by the market opportunity but most importantly by the needs of rebuilding the right consumption of chinese consumers in the name of economical development of china dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst great that s helpful thank you operator the next question will come from lauren lieberman with barclays please go ahead lauren lieberman barclays analyst great thanks good morning i was hoping we d talk actually a little bit about the americas because the strength this quarter the inflection was very notable so i was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how much you think this is tied to just being really proactive in promoting in getting behind it i should say excuse me fragrance and skin and holiday being the key to this or are you starting to see other lift that you thinking can carry through past holiday and then in part with that of course we ve had the news about incremental macy s door closures this week so if you can just comment on the outlook for the rest of the year in the americas thanks fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer so first of all in as we said this quarter has contributed to the stabilization of our north america business and this has been in line with the strategy we communicated in investor day and we remain commitment to continue the work of stabilization in the next months so what happened this quarter is first of all we have used as anticipated much more granular insight in the market to activate our plans and much more local relevance in the activation the other thing that happened we have recognized the softness of the overall makeup market and that s why we have accelerated our activity in skin care and particularly fragrances during the holiday season that were well fitting the situation and we got great results so we have if you want adjusted our engines of growth in a way that contributed to the good results our innovation pipeline as anticipated has been strong and the impact of innovation has improved and so all these have been a positive impact we will continue to operate in that direction but we do have still to be confront some of the headwinds to be clear the makeup softness particularly the color makeup soft is continuing as you mentioned the closures of certain retailing stores where we do have high market share will continue although we completely share the macy s strategy of focusing on the high performance doors and are gradually stopping the smaller and lower performance doors with as i said we support this strategy but obviously we will need to operate with the strategy making sure that we retain the consumer the brands and this will be difficult but we will do our best to do that so we need to take under account our extraordinary efforts to improve our model that are working but also take on under account there will continue to be headwinds so our strategy remains at this point stabilization lauren lieberman barclays analyst great and just as a follow up how are you thinking about the impact of chinese travelers not really visiting the u s over the next several months just in terms of the outlook fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer that s actually a good point we assume that there will be obviously an important reduction of chinese travelers not visiting the u s in the next at least two three months and this will have a negative impact obviously on the sales to chinese students frankly in this moment we are assuming in our guidance also a slow down on any travel population to be clear in this moment because of the coronavirus global concern tourists in general is being reduced temporary so we are taking the assumption of this temporary reduction under account in our guidance lauren lieberman barclays analyst okay thanks so much tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer and i just want to add as it relates to our guidance i mentioned the range of 1 82 to 1 91 which is what s in our press release i think i ve mentioned a different number in our guidance for the second half operator the next question is from michael binetti with credit suisse please go ahead michael binetti credit suisse analyst hey guys thanks for taking our question and congrats on a really good quarter so i want to ask you on the dr jart dilution could you walk us through how much the 0 18 we re trying to think forward i guess over the four quarters of integrating that business how much of that is one time in nature and when you see that starting to wear off or even possibly turn to an accretive position and then i just i want to ask you as you think through the u s number a little bit so do you think the retailers that you worked with on the holiday strategy to get more skin care and fragrance out there they really seem to want to keep pushing on makeup even as the warning signs were showing up over the last year or two do you think they ve gone through the psychological change yet that skin care is going to be the driver for the medium term and are they accepting that they have to pull back more on makeup in a structural way i guess are the gains you saw in skin care and fragrance would you characterize those as sticky and shelf space gains that are going to remain dedicated to those categories as we look into calendar 2020 tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer yes so starting with have be dilution we obviously have the step up in inventory which is one time depends on how you re treating the interest expense which is also in that number what i would say michael is that we expect that have be will be if you think forward relatively flat including purchase accounting so eliminating those one time items next year and accretive the following year michael binetti credit suisse analyst okay tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer the makeup question is the second question fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer yeah sorry could you repeat who was the subject of the makeup question when you said they i didn t understand michael binetti credit suisse analyst well it sounds like it was a pretty meaningful acceleration obviously in north america or in america we can see your numbers but it sounds like the number that you got from specialty multi which was a great growth channel for you guys over the last few years but slowed recently it sounds like it improved a lot this quarter and it sounds like you worked with them on skin care and i m just wondering if you feel like that channel they feel like they ve gone through the mental change of saying look skin care is going to be the bigger driver and we re going to give them give that category more shelf space that sticks around calendar 20 fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer frankly yes i think everyone realized the power of skin care in this moment and we are all working together to leverage the power of skin care also because skin care for instant results and skin care product combined with makeup is on a growth so there are yeah you speak about shelf space which obviously is a bit more gradual in the way it changes but definitely innovation programs are reflecting a lot of this so there is more activity more social media more advertising in skin care than before and this i think is a reflection on the results by the way makeup is a big category the makeup for face meaning foundation for example is still doing very very well the place which is softer is color and importantly what we are doing to contribute not only to leverage skin care and fragrances better but to reinstate growth in makeup in the future is we are accelerating the innovation in the makeup category contributing to the future results of our retail partners also in this category so to be clear we are not giving up at all on makeup we are just accepting that in the short term we are focusing more on other category and innovating better in makeup to reactivate the consumer interest michael binetti credit suisse analyst thank you very much congrats on getting north america back to positive fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from erinn murphy with piper sandler please go ahead erinn murphy piper sandler analyst great thanks good morning and let me add my congratulations i guess my question is around amazon there s been some press out recently talking about them potentially evolving their model to launch some luxury brands maybe using a concession model if something like this was to play out would you ever consider or reconsider excuse me amazon as a channel for luxury beauty and then just a follow up on china can you share tracey maybe what percent of physical doors have been shuttered and are you seeing any major change in trend in the online business in china since that outbreak has escalated thank you fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer okay on the first question is the answer is no at this point we are not considering amazon a channel for our luxury beauty products and we are focusing on our current channels and our current partners to build and continue the stabilization in north america business as far as the china question is the the number of physical doors i ll let tracy go with that tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer yeah so as you can imagine it s quite fluid and one of the things that we ve seen is the chinese new year extended for many many of our employees our stores have closed as malls have closed so very recently two thirds of our department store doors were closed and the remaining doors were on reduced hours now that could change next week so this is a very fluid situation fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer and on the second part of the china question which is the online absolutely the online channel is very strong in china and the as we said in the second quarter but in this moment also online is suffering because in this moment in the middle of the outbreak the delivery system in homes and in the big distribution centers also people are not working like in this moment till february 10 many people the non essential activity in factories and other situation this is stopped the same is for distribution centers the same for our activities so online at least in the short term is having the same issues of brick and mortar in term of the role of online in the recovery in the future we are optimistic that online will play a very strong role in the recovery when the recovery will happen erinn murphy piper sandler analyst thank you for that context all the best fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from steve strycula with ubs please go ahead steven strycula ubs analyst hi good morning so first part of my question just wanted to follow up on erinn s question can you give us a little bit more texture as to how do disaggregate how maybe mainland china sales are performing versus the travel retail component of the business primarily as how we think about modeling the back half of the year one of those businesses is housed within the emea segment the other business is clearly housed in apac so just want to get a little bit more texture as to which one is being more impacted real time and then fabrizio if you use history as a guide post here how do we think about once the issue is call it quote unquote contained what is like the recovery path off from that moment forward is it typically from what you ve seen before three or four months for travel retail to come back online from flights being booked any help would be appreciated thanks fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer yeah so the short answer to the first question in this moment travel retail is the most impacted channel because if you think what s just to give you the context of what s happening you will probably know that more than 60 airlines just closed their flights so in this moment the travel in and out of china is suspended in the large majority of cases so there is lack of traffic for just in and out of china second in general tourism in this moment is not prudent because it is a global issue the outbreak it is a global concern and so many people which are concerned to travel in this moment are reducing their choice or postponing some of their travel and i m speaking touristic travel then there is a third factor is many companies have banned travel to china but also to any other place where there is the virus and so business travel has been reduced not to count the many companies are reducing business travel for cost containment reasons so in this moment the amount of travel in airports is reduced and traffic is significantly reduced so that s the biggest impact the second biggest impact is obviously china mainland itself and hong kong which are reduced significant so i would say the greater china area because all the reason that we have already discussed in the prepared remarks that i m not going to repeat but the most important thing is that keep in mind that till february 10 most of the cities are not even people are not back to work until at february children of that school and people are requested rightly so not to get out of home for reason which are not essential and not to go in public transportation where there is a risk of contamination so the behaviors of the entire population is fundamentally changed and because of this is the second area where in the short term we expect an impact the second part of your question is the recovery now the recovery we know what you know we have stated all the previous cases and all the previous situation and what we see that the recovery tends to be a hockey stick meaning when the things is back it is back particularly in the traveling when traffic is back traffic is back and the people buy the thing that we can do more in term of the business learning that we are applying during the period before the recovery in travel retail will be very important to push conversion meaning when there is you know travel retail is built by traffic by conversion conversion is an area where we re making many improvements so in this period of transition where traffic will be low we are reworking our plans to use conversion as a key mitigating element of the dip and then obviously we are preparing for future recovery plans when the time will arrive the last point i want to make is that we will try to tune the recovery to the recovery of the chinese economy the chinese population we don t want just to look this as a business we want to look at this as a contribution to the recovery of the country and really supporting our employees at the country and the same will happen in travel retail where for example some of our customers and retail partners are chinese and we are going to stay close to them to contribute to the recovery of the travel retail business to make sure that our long term retail partners will benefit from the recovery as much as possible and to start this all again to restart the right process and to regain momentum not only for us but for the entire industry operator the next question is from andrea teixeira with jp morgan please go ahead andrea teixeira jp morgan analyst thank you good morning and i just want to echo the congrats on your results fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer thank you andrea teixeira jp morgan analyst so as a follow up on the north america and the commentary you made for mix fabrizio and obviously there was it s natural that in the holidays there s more giftable skin care and fragrances and you are also putting more i think prudently putting more marketing behind those lines so do you think that innovation and momentum continue to build into the next few quarters or we may be potentially had some seasonal positive impact of that into the second quarter thank you tracey t travis executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer so i ll start and then fabrizio can also add his comments we are progressing toward stabilization in north america and clearly it was a strong holiday and strong second quarter for us in north america and in other parts of the globe so our teams have worked awfully hard to make this holiday season a very good one and consumers responded and we re very happy about that as we look at the back half of the year fabrizio touched on the fact that we do have tourists that we expect that that business to be a bit softer given the situation that we re managing through globally and i would also say that north america is making progressive progress however i would not expect that the second quarter would necessarily be reflective of continued acceleration from there but the north america team is executing against all of the strategies that were laid out last year and we re seeing some good outcomes from that so what we told you last quarter was north america we expect certainly to have better performance this year than we did last year in north america so that is progression toward stabilization lauren asked earlier about the macy s announcement and clearly as we ve been saying for some time we believe that brick and mortar needs to be taken out of north america and north america has been over retailed for some time so we are very much aligned with what macy s has announced in their investor day yesterday the doors that actually would be closing in our fiscal year were already included in our guidance andrea teixeira jp morgan analyst thanks helpful operator the next question will come from mark astrachan with stifel please go ahead mark astrachan stifel analyst thanks and good morning everybody i was wondering if you could quantify the online percentage of sales from china and related to that also if you could just quantify the impact benefit from e commerce accelerating consumption the enhanced availability in china in other words previously consumers would have to visit cities selling the products and now you are up to 123 but e commerce obviously makes the product available everywhere so maybe if you could just talk a bit about how you think about that dynamic as having helped partner sales and how you think about that on a go forward basis and maybe if you think about some of those tier 3 to 5 cities which didn t have product readily available but now people can order online how do you think about that in terms of accelerating demand maintaining that demand and kind of how that will impact future growth fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer that is a very good question as i commented other times on the subject this is a very important phenomenon because today we have physical distribution in china in 123 cities with our most distributed brands which are lauder and clinique and much lower city coverage in the other brands which are still on the growth trajectory so there is a lot of physical distribution potential in the long term still untapped but at the same time we know there is demand in china now in over 600 cities so there are over 450 cities where there is strong demand and there is not yet physical distribution of prestige luxury and for sure prestige luxury obviously the lauder brands so this demand gets filled by online and gets filled by when this consumer travel also travel within china like in amazing three tier like hainan island then where they can access the products or when they travel for internal business for vacation like going to beijing or to shanghai so that s the situation but online cover a lot the cities and that s why also is growing and it is very strategic because give us access to these consumers in a very productive way the other important positive consequence of this dynamic is that the brick and mortar can remain very productive can remain very focused where there is the right productivity and online can cover productively the rest so this is a good phenomenon continue to grow it is definitely one of the reason behind my comment that we are having better and better results also in the tier 3 and tier 4 cities also where physical distribution is not yet arrived in term of percentage of sales china is the highest percentage of sales online versus other markets it is on the high side and it s continued to grow operator we have time for one more question and that question will come from nik modi with rbc capital markets nik modi rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks thanks for the question good morning everyone i just wanted to follow up on mark s question fabrizio how much flexibility do you have to turn up the dial on really focusing on some of those lower tier cities that you just referenced i m just thinking about as kind of the year progresses and if you really wanted to turn up the dial to generate sales growth in some of these other tier cities do you have that kind of control in the near term or is it a much longer term burn fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer i mean we have control of the online with our partners like tmall and obviously our own online activity but remember our way to build distribution also to build coverage is we are in luxury and for us selective distribution which means demand ahead of supply is very important so we gradually build the demand and the reason why today demand is growing so fast also in the city is social media because while in the past advertising was local meaning advertising was focused in the cities where there was physical distribution social media by definition is national so you are in a dynamic where demand is normally ahead of supply and that s the typical demand of a good luxury market and we have filled in this demand gradually and making sure that we keep the concept of desirability and high quality and high quality also the experience that we give to our consumer in mind so we are not selling products we are selling quality and full experiences and we only do that when we can provide the best possible service to the consumer so the short answer is gradually but yes we have the capability to dial up as the market opportunity reveals itself nik modi rbc capital markets analyst and just a quick follow up of the 450 cities you cited in china as opportunity how many do you believe estee lauder as a company has a very good handle on demand and just the general consumer insights in those cities fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer i will now give you specific numbers but i can tell you that we have the consumer data so we know the number of consumers that are buying from different cities even we use this data analytics to decide where to open physical distribution so we use the demand and the elements of the strengths of the demand from the cities also to judge our physical distribution strategy to make sure that we continue to provide better high touch services to the consumer when the demand is sufficient to be productive and to offer the quality and the service that we need to offer so it is a gradual development of quality service nik modi rbc capital markets analyst very helpful thank you fabrizio freda president and chief executive officer welcome operator that concludes today s question and answer session if you were unable to join for

blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt says herbert hoover the 31st president of the united states of america on the issues of debt hoover will just be one of the billions of people in the world including famous economists and financial experts who do not hold any believe different from that expressed by him hoover consequently governments and central bank governors all over the world try as much to create enough fiscal space for their economies by borrowing less and spending reasonable amounts of income so as to stay afloat in fact international financial institutions like the bretton woods institutions are the front liners when it comes to issues of government spending where they discourage particularly developing countries from spending more whilst encouraging them to tax more and borrow less the issue of debt sustainability is so important because it has led to the crumbling of so many economies especially when it is not managed well ghana has had to resort to the imf 16 times since independence for bailout due to debt distress but this has not yielded significant results to propel the country to development debt has crushed so many economies like greece puerto rico argentina etc it has become a weapon in the hands of government critics and oppositions through out the world and in fact it equally but ignorantly serves as a marking scheme based on which the performance of a country or a certain government is assessed this has made governments alert on the issues of debt it is no wonder the government of ghana in 2019 accented to a bill that sought to cap government yearly deficit at 5 however the obsessiveness of countries to look good outwardly has made them pay less attention to the opportunities that they could harness through debt to catapult themselves to the league of developed nations in the world on the issues of debt sustainability the nominal figure of the debt is irrelevant and as a result economists prefer to use the debt to gdp as well as annual deficits though this is an important tool in debt sustainability analysis dsa it has been used wrongly in the sense that people immediately forget that it is not about how much you owe but about how able you are to pay back the loan at the stipulated time and whether you will be able to pay back the loan also depends on how you used the money this is simple borrow as much as you can so long as you have opportunities that will enable you pay back the loan as required without default or having to restructure the debt hence investors are mostly and mainly interested on how your future looks bright or bleak as mentioned earlier many of those countries that borrow a lot tend to be distressed by these debts thereby crushing their economies ironically though ghana has a lower debt to gdp ratio as compared to so many of the developed countries over 105 in us singapore 112 japan 253 etc international monetary organizations like the imf and the world bank complain often about the level of debt in ghana which is 62 than they do about the nature of debt in the developed world mainly because they consider the abilities of the countries to pay without having to resort to debt restructuring or default most of these developed countries especially europe and the us have had these high debt levels for a very long time after the world war ii wwii europe was devastated and needed help and the only country then that could help re build europe was the united states so this led to the formation of the bretton woods institutions namely the imf world bank and the international trade organization these same institutions today exist and fortunately for europe this really did help restore her but not africa which has been fed with several of billions of dollars ever since the difference in the success stories is nothing but institutions europe had the institutions to ensure that the money they received was used for the most critical projects that will put them to their feet even though those institutions were in havoc and only needed revamp developing countries are not suffering because they are economicallyignorant read why nations fail by acemoglu and robinson or due to over reliance on loans but because the loans that they take usually with high interests do not go to the right institutions if loans and aid were that deadly then a devastated europe should have remained devastated ever after the wwii this understanding of the dsa then leads us to analyze whether africa has those opportunities or not which merits more investments in our part of the world developing countries usually not much is done by the private sector the private sector is weak and thus unable to produce and provide enough jobs in the economy this means the amount of productivity in a particular economy sometimes depends mainly on government spending this is so because private spending in a country like ghana depends usually on government spending hence for us to provide more employment opportunities to the numerous unemployed graduates associations across the country we need to be able to invest massively in certain critical parts of the economy such as agriculture it is common knowledge that the private sector is normally the engine and driver of growth in almost every economy with the potential to develop but our continent unfortunately is plagued with low savings and therefore low internal investment contrary to the widely held notion that a government that borrows to spend discourages not only public savings but also private savings warren mosler an american post keynesian economist who is one of the leading pioneers of the modern monetary theory in his book the seven deadly innocent frauds of economic policy asserts that when government spends that part of the money which does not return to the government in the form of tax stays in the hands of private individuals which is either spent or kept as savings by cutting their spending this will then lead to more savings than would have been the case if the government had not ran a deficit thus if government deficit is not large enough to cater for these savings desires then people in their attempt to save will createunemployment since a cedi spent on a good keeps another person in employment this attempts to explain how government running a deficit is so important most especially in developing countries like ghana what will be the essence of not borrowing more when you know that borrowing more will only open up dormant sectors of the economy and scale up productivity running a zero deficit economy without much productivity would not lead to development than would borrowing to spend recklessly without vision lead to debt sustainability african countries still have so many important and highly profitable investment opportunities that have not been exploited therefore it is not surprising that a majority of our people are still unemployed and large proportion of our citizens still battling the age long curse of poverty that continue to lurk in every corner of this land of opportunities this means any government that is able to invest widely and wisely in the appropriate opportunities should be able to pay her debt not less than a good business will be able to pay its debt for instance the government of president akuffo addo has initiatednot just an ambitious but also a very laudable policy of 1 village 1 dam in all regions of the northern part of ghana which is usually dry for most part of the year issue of its implementation will be for another day this policy if well implemented will not just provide jobs for the youth but will be able to immediately provide government revenue through tax from the agricultural produce help the government reduce the numerous freebies that she doles out to the poor in the name of social interventions because living conditions would have improved which means a lot more money can actually be saved by merely borrowing to provide jobs to the people a clear example now is the government s planting for food and jobs it would be unbelievable to have any well meaning ghanaian push against the use of borrowed money for such a worthy course a famous concern among critics of sufficient government expenditure is that it will lead to an increase in the inflation and interest rates which is truly common among countries with high debt levels the reason is simple to grasp it is simply because spending goes with productivity and so if the loan is spent unproductively like was done in ghana in 2012 where government had to suddenly spend in excess of 12 of gdp so they could retain power that year then certainly such unguided and unyielding spending will only derail the economy and bring it to its knees no wonder rising inflation became prevalent and gdp growth rate dragged its feet below 5 this suffocated the fiscal space and even though the government had just ended an imf program in 2012 it had to run to the imf in 2015 for yet another credit facility thus a rising inflation can be averted by correspondingly increasing productivity remember demand pull inflation is simply too much money chasing too few goods but when too much money is chasing too much goods then surely the inflation rate will be stable and this increase in productivity will lead to an increase in savings as explained above and as is common knowledge this rising savings will slow down the interest rate externally the increase in investor confidence due to the prudent and productive use of borrowed money will still keep the interest on our external bonds at reasonable levels remember that the interest on loans becomes deadly only when such interest rates exceeds the gdp growth rate the reason most developing countries are usually unable to pay back their loans despite the opportunities that are as glaring as the numerous cases of malaria extreme poverty illiteracy and pockets of tribal conflicts etc is the huge level of corruption and embezzlements which are pervasive with borrowed funds investing borrowed funds into unyielding ventures such as the building of a presidential palace buying of chocolate for school children as is currently been done by cocobod use of borrowed funds meant for medical research for research into the electoral chances of a political party etc which will never yield anything to pay back the loan also the use of short term loans to invest in long term projects which will not yield returnsquickly to pay the debt these and many others will only suffocate the economy and not create enough fiscal space for the economy to thrive the 2001 nobel prize winner in economics joseph stiglitz puts it better when he said debt in itself is not bad it is just the channels through which they are expended and how fast they pile up sadly these are the realities of africa consequently the issues with developing countries are institutional and leadership but not debt and thus the needless arguments by politicians and policy makers in africa particularly ghana about which administration has borrowed more is misplaced the debate should be about how much confidence which is easily determined by the economic indicators has been earned both locally and externally which will affect future bonds and investments and what impact on the economy has been made by government through their prudent and wise use of the borrowed money for debt as suggested by the famous economist james galbraith is not a burden in the future contrary to herbert hoover s remark everything produced in the future will be consumed in the future how much will be produced depends on how productive the economy is at that time this has nothing to do with public debt today a higher public debt today does not reduce future production and if it motivates wise use of resources today which unfortunately eludes africa may increase productivity of the economy in the future abba lerner renowned for the lerner s index the champion of functional finance posits that public policy should be judged by its results in the real world employment productivity and price stability and not by whatever may be happening to budget and debt numbers jonathan mcmills ewusi amoah

sri lanka s ethno religious and cultural diversity is a blessing in disguise contrary to what present day buddhist supremacists seem to believe pic by shehan gunasekara president gotabaya rajapaksa pgr coined the phrase prosperity with splendour and promulgated it as the chief objective of his presidency it is a tacit acceptance that 72 years of independence had neither brought prosperity nor splendour why did a nation endowed with so much natural resources and human talent which gained its independence on a platter without shedding a drop of blood but with ample foreign reserves inherited a highly efficient civil service and public administration and managed to establish with pride one of the most successful welfare states in asia fail to build on that enviable edifice a modern economic powerhouse like a few of her asian neighbours economists may theorise the causes of this failure ad nauseam but the most fundamental of reasons that prevented such a transformation goes beyond economics and enters deep into the nation s politics it was the metastasis of communal politics that sowed the seeds of national disunity and inter communal discontent which ultimately deprived the economy of the vitally needed synergy emanating from a united citizenry sri lanka s ethno religious and cultural diversity sri lanka s ethno religious and cultural diversity is a blessing in disguise contrary to what present day buddhist supremacists seem to believe the ancient rulers of this nation realised this fact and harnessed that diversity to create prosperity with splendour the difference between now and then is that those monarchs with true commitment to their buddhist faith and its values treated every component of that plurality with equal dignity respect and tolerance although every community had its own social hierarchy and stratification each community in the eyes of the ruler carried the same status the sangha of course advised those rulers when needed to make the realm virtuous and in conformity with buddhist ethos in short and to put it in modern political parlance every subject under those monarchs was an equal citizen the kingdom was a united but plural entity in which every community and every subject lived in peace and contributed to the best of their ability to the success of the realm political and economic rationalism and not religious bigotry ruled the day today s supremacists are deliberately hiding this beautiful chapter of sri lanka s golden history in order to thrust their own twisted version history is prostituted to satisfy the demands of power hungry chauvinists sinhala and tamil ethno nationalism the western concept of nation state and nationalism which were originally devised to unite warring petty kingdoms in medieval christendom later became in the hands of european colonisers a divisive and poisonous instrument to divide and rule several plural societies that remained peaceful and cosmopolitan until the colonialists arrived the disintegration and destruction of the ottoman empire is proof par excellence of the handy work of poisonous nationalism similarly sinhala and tamil ethno nationalism which sapped the economic vitality of this island and dragged it into a foolish and futile civil war were a by product of the same so called westphalian synthesis as an outgrowth of this ethno nationalism is the idea of buddhist supremacy which is now dictating the political and economic agenda of pgr and his caretaker government pgr s strategy of political exclusion with economic inclusion of minorities is a clear expression of supremacist thinking how could he or any government under him achieve prosperity with splendour by empowering one group at the expense of another is beyond any sense of political rationality and economic justice a few days ago it was reported that one of the militant members of the sangha while addressing a gathering in jaffna called on tamil leaders and their people to learn the sinhalese language and join the majority to develop the nation he did not even have the courtesy to say that he was willing to learn the tamil language at least to communicate with tamils and understand their feelings grievances and aspirations it is the same ven thera who also wants to homogenise different marriage laws and traditions in the country in favour of one common law people of his ilk insisted and won prohibiting the national anthem to be sung in tamil at independence day celebrations with this type of racism they are also indirectly advocating that tamil speakers need not espouse patriotic emotions what a dangerous attitude especially at a time when foreign powers are vying to gain a long term foothold in the country a divided nation is an inviting terrain for scheming outsiders similarly on a different occasion a budding muslim leader was calling members of his own community to join the sinhala majority and be part of pgr s race for economic development this native informer should know very well that the supremacists who are behind pgr while not prepared to consider the tamils as co owners of this land are also questioning the indigenousness of muslims in this country in other words to the supremacists members of the two minority communities are virtually non citizens at best or second class citizens at worst how could any leader expect to promote genuine political partnership on such unequal terms such a partnership would eventually lead to a master servant relationship which seems to be the objective behind pgr s authoritarianism with soft militarisation of government s high powered administrative and managerial sectors and with the posting of security personnel in every district apparently to assist in development work a police state seems to be looming on the horizon stop using the heart to do the work of brain a workable solution to the national question and post war reconciliation is possible if supremacists and their opponents stop using the heart to do the work of brain let reason prevail over emotion and consider a solution in the context of the gravity of situation confronting the country today of the manifold issues facing the nation two are critical and they need a united effort from the entire population to tackle successfully one is the economy and the other is national security on the economic front behind the massaged statistics dished out by ministers and their appointees an unbiased review of the real economy depicts a worrying future sky rocketing cost of living amidst ad hoc populist handouts increasing unemployment worsen by underemployment chronic budget deficits caused by wasteful expenses and falling public revenue mounting national debt depreciating rupee and resulting inflationary pressures are problems that cannot be solved without massive increase in domestic output with surplus to export foreign direct investment fdi can certainly be of assistance though not the solution but even fdi will not flow in unless the home ground is attractive and safe to investors that attraction depends on the quality of domestic infrastructure quality of domestic labour and associated factors of production and above all a peaceful political and social environment the last of these is rarely stressed by theoretical economists but assumed away at best under the all inclusive ceteris paribus in sri lanka especially peace and security is precondition to achieve prosperity with splendour modern economies are not built on science and technology alone although they are crucial but with the co operative effort of the people who contribute to and benefit from those economies that co operation cannot be bought or forced it has to be spontaneous and that spontaneity depends on how free independent and happy people feel about the socio political surrounding in which they live this is why popular democracy is such an attractive political model especially for plural societies it provides opportunities for a numerical minority to become a political majority and vice versa depending on the policies they advocate and programs they represent having denuded democracy of its inner substance while preserving it carapace of political parties and periodic elections ethno nationalism in this country has destroyed socio political peace which in turn has thwarted prosperity with splendour political exclusion and economic inclusion will not work that peace cannot be recovered by relying on security forces alone increasing the size of police army air and naval personnel that are imbued with supremacist thoughts equipping them with expensive and state of the art weapons and allowing them to roam around in every city town and village may succeed in injecting fear and anxiety among masses but will not promote societal peace and the necessary confidence in the future especially among communities that had been grievously hurt by past injustices at the hands of these forces without peace and confidence economic efforts will remain suboptimal at best this is why pgr s strategy of political exclusion and economic inclusion will not work once again it should be stressed that our policy makers study closely how pluralist singapore built its singaporean identity that turned that resource poor tiny island into a regional economic giant in a public address delivered by lee kwan yew in the mid 1980s he warned the chinese chauvinists in his country not to commit the error of sri lanka by advocating ethno nationalism it was the same lee who envied the development of this island when he visited in early 1950s with reference to security pgr and his caretaker government need not be reminded of the fact that the art of warfare has changed dramatically in recent years we are living in an age of drone attacks and cyber terrorism to protect an island like ours against such misfortunes requires international cooperation that cooperation has now become a complex matter because of geopolitical developments in the indian ocean to trumpet that sri lanka adopts a neutral foreign policy is simply for public consumption bereft of substance because of the strategic developments in the indian ocean there is always a possibility that sri lanka may become a new theatre of war in asia and that war will not be fought with conventional weapons the nation is well and truly trapped by the geostrategic manoeuvrings of india china and the usa how our own civil war itself contributed to this tragic situation is a sordid chapter altogether which the supremacists may not want to read about or listen to given this scenario at least a united sri lanka can help to minimise possible damages the old adage united we stand and divided we fall is no more appropriate than it is now this is why it is time that pgr and his supremacists from the political economic and religious circles address the national question without delay and with open mind what the country needs is unity with equality among its plural constituents with that unity prosperity with splendour is certainly within our reach the writer is attached to

chief executive officer thank you matt and good morning everyone 2019 was a terrific year for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners nextera energy s performance was strong both financially and operationally and we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company by successfully executing on our plans nextera energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of 8 37 up 8 7 from 2018 over the past 15 years we ve now delivered compound annual growth in adjusted eps of nearly 8 5 which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 4 over the same period amidst the significant growth the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry in 2019 we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43 significantly outperforming both the s p 500 and the s p 500 utilities index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one three five seven and 10 year basis over the past 15 years we have outperformed all of the other companies in the s p utilities index and 85 of the companies in the s p 500 while more than tripling the total shareholder return of both indices although we are proud of our long term track record of creating shareholder value we remain utterly focused on the future and committed to continuing that track record going forward during 2019 fpl successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan including placing the highly efficient okeechobee clean energy center and an additional 300 megawatts of cost effective solar in service on time and on budget smart capital investments such as these help fpl improve its already best in class customer value proposition despite customer bills that were already nearly 30 below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of florida earlier this month the typical fpl residential customer bill decreased by nearly 4 or roughly 4 fpl had continued success with its cost savings initiatives reducing its already best in class dollar per retail megawatt hour non fuel o m costs by more than 5 year over year these ongoing cost savings combined with the flexibility afforded by fpl s current settlement agreement enabled fpl to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly 260 million of storm restoration costs related to hurricane dorian in addition to low bills fpl delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation finally last quarter we were pleased that following an extensive and thorough 18 month review the nuclear regulatory commission granted turkey point units 3 and 4 their second 20 year license extensions these units are the first nuclear power plants in the united states to achieve this milestone and this decision supports the continued production of clean zero emission reliable and affordable nuclear power in florida for many years to come beyond executing on its strategic initiatives during 2019 fpl positioned itself well for continued long term growth early in the year fpl announced its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan which is one of the world s largest solar expansions and will result in roughly 10 000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on fpl s solar system fpl system this solar expansion combined with low cost battery storage solutions such as the manatee energy storage center that was announced during 2019 represent the next phase of fpl s generation modernization efforts and are expected to further reduce fpl s co2 emissions rates which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30 since 2005 in addition to the terrific progress in generation during the year florida past the public utility storm protection plans law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments including undergrounding this new law supports continued hardening of fpl s already storm resilient energy grid and allows fpl to pursue these investments in a programmatic manner over the course of decades while deploying billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers we expect the final rules related to the new law to take effect later this quarter and that fpl will seek to begin clause recovery of its storm hardening investments beginning in 2021 with terrific visibility into significant investment programs such as these we remain as confident as ever about fpl s ability to sustain its long term growth trajectory while further improving our customers value proposition the energy resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2019 the renewables origination success remained particularly strong with the team adding more than 5 800 megawatts to our backlog over the past year as we continue operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history our ongoing renewables origination success results from our ability to leverage energy resources competitive advantages including our best in class development skills large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions strong customer relationships purchasing power best in class construction expertise resource assessment capabilities strong access to and cost of capital advantages and world class operations capability more than 50 of the solar megawatts that were added to our backlog in 2019 including a battery storage component and the current backlog is more than 2 000 megawatts of trifecta projects that combined wind solar and battery storage together we also increasingly see storage as an important stand alone business in its own right as we were viewing a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the itc and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers this highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution as well as energy resources unique skills to combine the three technologies into integrated near firm low cost products energy resources significant competitive advantages position it well to capitalize on the enormous disruption that is occurring to the nation s generation fleet we continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives new near firm wind is going to be a 20 to 30 per megawatt hour product and new near firm solar is going to be a 30 to 40 per megawatt hour product at these prices new near firm renewables will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal nuclear less efficient oil and gas fire generation units we were pleased by the 60 ptc extension that was passed in 2019 and we expect that will support incremental wind demand in 2023 and 2024 our confidence in renewables being the low cost generation alternative in the middle of this decade remains stronger than ever we expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade let me now turn to gulf power and highlight how we executed in 2019 against some of the long term objectives that we outlined at last year as we ve often discussed two of the key hallmarks of the nextera energy playbook are reduced operating costs and using those savings to fund smart capital investments for our customers after one year of ownership we are well on our way to executing this strategy at gulf power in 2019 we reduced gulf power s o m costs by approximately 20 year over year in addition to lowering costs we ve also identified smart investment opportunities to benefit customers in 2019 gulf power invested approximately 730 million or roughly 2 5 times gulf power s average capital investment amount over the past five years and was able to grow regulatory capital employed at roughly 11 year over year beyond realizing operating efficiencies and deploying smart capital in the past year gulf power was able to meaningfully improve its customer value proposition gulf power achieved its best ever service reliability year which was approximately 20 better than its 2018 results customer service was also better with notable improvements in speed of answer in florida public service commission complaints there is nothing more important in our company than the safety of our employees we made significant improvements in this area in 2019 as well with an approximately 40 reduction in our osha rate at gulf power versus 2018 as the major capital investments that we advanced during 2019 come into service in 2020 and beyond they will help achieve the other key objectives that we have outlined at gulf power such as meaningful emissions reductions and perhaps most importantly a significant reduction in customer bills in real terms in addition to creating tremendous customer value we expect that execution of the plans we laid out at gulf power will also generate great outcomes for our shareholders as well in our first year of ownership gulf power s adjusted earnings increased by 25 year over year this outcome was even better than our plan at the start of the year and positions us well to deliver on the financial growth objectives that we outlined when we announced the acquisition this high level performance across the board would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all gulf power employees while we are pleased with the results that we ve achieved at gulf power during 2019 we remain focused on the significant execution ahead of us here to deliver even greater value to our customers and our shareholders finally we were once again honored to be named for the 13th time in 14 years number 1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on fortune s list of most admired companies as well as ranked among the top 10 companies worldwide across all industries for social responsibility during 2019 alone nextera energy made approximately 13 billion in capital investments in american energy infrastructure making us one of the top capital investors in the u s in any industry none of these recognitions nor our track record of success would be possible without the hard work and commitment to excellence of our people who live our core value of doing the right thing every day in the last year there has been an increasing focus on the esg on the part of many of our stakeholders the fact is our company has been focused on all of the elements of esg for more than 25 years we are proud of our track record here but there is still so much more to do in this country to decarbonize the electric transportation in industrial sectors nextera energy is living proof that you can be clean and low cost and financially successful all at the same time we will be at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector we expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful co2 emissions reductions across the country while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and our continued investments in clean energy will help advance nextera energy toward its goal of reducing its co2 emissions rate by 67 by 2025 from a 2005 baseline in summary i continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about nextera energy s long term growth prospects in 2019 we extended our long term track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best in class organic growth prospects based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses i will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020 2021 and 2022 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years let me now turn to nextera energy partners which also had a terrific year of execution in 2019 in the more than five years since the ipo nextera energy partners has consistently delivered on its commitments that execute that history of execution is supported by nextera energy partners outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets which grew significantly and was further diversified in 2019 during the year nextera energy partners acquired a portfolio of more than 600 megawatts of wind and solar assets from energy resources additionally during the fourth quarter nextera energy partners closed down the acquisition of meade pipeline company which owns an approximately 40 aggregate interest in central penn line an intrastate natural gas pipeline in pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14 year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk finally during the year nextera energy partners advanced an additional organic growth opportunity announcing the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects we are proud that 2019 is the first year that nextera energy partners successfully executed on all of the three ways it can grow organically acquiring assets from third parties and acquiring assets from energy resources portfolio highlighting the clear flexibility and visibility into growth going forward to support the ongoing growth investments and optimize the capital structure for the benefit of lp unitholders nextera energy partners completed a number of financings and refinancings in 2019 as well at the start of the year nextera energy partners faced headwinds related to the pg e bankruptcy the team immediately focused on managing and mitigating the negative impacts of this event and we ended 2019 having favorably addressed many of the challenges the energy resources portfolio acquisition and associated financing that we announced last march allowed nextera energy partners to complete its original 2019 growth objectives even after excluding pg e related project cash flows during the year nextera energy partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our genesis project in addition to resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution through the removal of project level debt service as a result of the purchase of the debt nextera energy partners received approximately 128 million of distributions that had been or were expected to be restricted at the project the release of this cash was used to partially fund the debt repurchase i remain confident about a long term favorable resolution for our pg e related assets in addition to growing lp distributions by 15 year over year and achieving a run rate adjusted ebitda range in excess of what was originally expected nextera energy partners year end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations assuming full contributions from pg e related projects represents approximately 60 growth from the comparable year end 2018 run rate range with this strong year over year growth in cash available for distribution nextera energy partners expects to be able to achieve its long term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021 as of year end 2020 we expect to have achieved nextera energy partners distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the mid 70s range even after excluding cash distributions from our desert sunlight projects nep delivered an attractive total unitholder return of approximately 28 in 2019 further advancing its history of value creation since the ipo i continue to believe that the combination of nep s clean energy portfolio growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offer lp unitholders an attractive investor value proposition as with nextera energy we remain focused on continuing to execute and delivering that unitholder value over the coming years i ll now turn the call over to rebecca who will review the 2019 results in more detail rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning everyone let s now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the fourth quarter of 2019 fpl reported net income of 400 million or 0 81 per share down 0 04 per share year over year for the full year 2019 fpl reported net income of 2 33 billion or 4 81 per share an increase of 0 26 per share versus 2018 regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8 3 for 2019 and was the principal driver of fpl s net income growth of roughly 8 for the full year during the fourth quarter growth from new investments was offset by a number of factors including a contribution to our charitable foundation that should fund its operations for the next several years fpl s capital expenditures were approximately 2 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly 5 8 billion fpl s reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11 6 for the 12 months ending december 31 2019 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6 to 11 6 under our current rate agreement during the fourth quarter we utilized a total of 18 million of reserve amortization including the approximately 260 million that was utilized to offset hurricane dorian storm restoration costs leaving fpl with a year end 2019 balance of 893 million we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for one additional year and as a result expect to file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in january of 2022 while we have not made a final decision based on our review we expect that the merging of fpl and gulf power and making a single rate case filing will result in customer benefits and we therefore see this as a likely approach for the filing at this time all of our major capital projects at fpl are progressing well the 10 solar sites totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across fpl s service territory are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to fpl customers in early 2020 to support the significant solar expansion that fpl is leading across florida we have secured sites that could support 10 gigawatts of future projects earlier this month florida public service commission held hearings on fpl s proposed solar together program we continue to expect a decision about the proposed program at the end of the first quarter beyond solar construction on the highly efficient roughly 1 200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operations date in 2022 we continue to expect that fpl s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate of regulatory capital employed of approximately 9 from 2018 through 2022 while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition let me now turn to gulf power which reported fourth quarter 2019 gaap and adjusted earnings of 23 million and 26 million respectively or 0 05 per share for the full year gulf power reported gaap earnings of 180 million or 0 37 per share and adjusted earnings of 200 million or 0 41 per share as a reminder during the first 12 months following the closing of the acquisition we excluded one time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings additionally interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in corporate and other gulf power s reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10 8 for the 12 months ending december 2019 which is in the upper half of the allowed band of 9 25 to 11 25 under its current rate agreement for the full year 2020 we expect to target a regulatory roe near the upper end of its allowed band assuming normal weather and operating conditions as jim discussed the overall execution of gulf power s capital program is advancing well gulf power s first solar development project the roughly 75 megawatt blue indigo solar energy center is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime all of the other major capital investments including the north florida resiliency connection and the plant crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track the florida economy remains healthy as florida s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation according to recent irs data florida attracted a net gain of roughly 16 billion in personal taxable income in 2018 by far the highest of any state in the country and the fastest rate of growth as well which is a reflection of the attraction of florida s low tax pro business policies florida s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3 1 below the national average and at the lowest level in the decade florida has now added nearly 2 million private sector jobs over the last 10 years leading indicators in the real estate sector have remained at a stable pace reflecting continued strength of the florida housing market other positive economic data across the state include continued strength in retail taxable sales as well as the consumer confidence index which remains near 10 year highs during the quarter fpl s average number of customers increased by approximately 100 000 from the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of vero beach s roughly 35 000 customers late last year for 2019 fpl s retail sales increased 1 7 from the prior year driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison on a weather normalized basis fpl s retail sales declined by 0 6 as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer the decline in underlying usage was a reversal from the trend that fpl experienced in 2018 when underlying usage increased by 1 7 as we previously noted usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly strong weather conditions similar to those experienced during 2019 which makes distinguishing between underlying usage changes and weather impacts challenging for gulf power the average number of customers increased slightly versus the comparable prior year quarter as it moves beyond the impacts of hurricane michael in 2018 for 2019 gulf power s retail sales declined slightly due to unfavorable weather and a small decline in underlying usage per customer let me now turn to energy resources beginning with a reporting change in our segments given the trans bay cable acquisition during 2019 we have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our competitive transmission business and the management of these projects within our company our reporting for energy resources now includes the results of our nextera energy transmission projects formerly reported in corporate and other segment our 2018 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes resulting in increase in energy resources full year 2018 adjusted eps of 0 09 per share incorporating the reporting change energy resources reported fourth quarter 2019 gaap earnings of 433 million or 0 88 per share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 326 million or 0 66 per share energy resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased 0 01 versus the prior year comparable period as strong underlying growth from new and existing investments was more than offset by a number of number of items including the negative 0 14 adjusted eps impact of our refinancing activities which were primarily related to financing breakage costs associated with several wind repowerings as well as energy resources share of cost associated with the acquisition of the outstanding genesis debt as a reminder while these financing refinancing activities created a reduction in fourth quarter adjusted earnings they are expected to translate to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders for the full year energy resources reported gaap earnings of 1 81 billion or 3 72 per share and adjusted earnings of 1 7 billion or 3 49 per share energy resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased 0 35 or approximately 11 versus 2018 for the full year growth was driven by continued additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by 0 55 per share contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by 0 13 versus the prior year also contributing favorably were the customer supply and trading business where our contributions increased by 0 05 versus 2018 and nextera energy transmission which increased results 0 04 year over year primarily as a result of the trans bay cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019 these favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense reflecting the negative 0 14 adjusted eps impact in the fourth quarter refinancing activities as well as growth in the business and lower contributions from the existing generation assets in 2019 wind resource was 96 of the long term average down from 97 a year earlier additional details are shown on the accompanying slide in 2019 energy resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind solar and battery storage projects commissioning approximately 2 700 megawatts of renewables projects in the us including repowering since the call we since the last call we have added 1 609 megawatts renewables projects to our backlog including approximately 500 megawatts of combined new wind and repowering 700 megawatts of solar and 340 megawatts of battery storage all of which will be paired with new solar projects energy resources has now placed a total of approximately 3 700 megawatts of repowering projects in service since 2017 which represents approximately one third of its operating wind portfolio as of year end 2016 we expect that by the end of 2020 more than 60 of energy resources operating wind projects will have been originally commissioned or repowered within the last five years highlighting the young age of the overall fleet and the expected long date future value creation of the portfolio following the terrific origination year in 2019 and with nearly three years remaining in the period we are now within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year for the post 2022 period our backlog is already more than 2 400 megawatts placing us far ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage the accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands beyond renewables as of year end 2019 the mountain valley pipeline was approximately 90 complete we have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for the pipeline and we continue to make good progress on these efforts we expect that the issues related to mvp s biological opinion and nationwide 12 permit will be resolved in the spring allowing construction work along much of the route to resume we also remain hopeful that the supreme court will overturn the fourth circuit court s original decision on atlantic coast pipeline s case related to its appalachian trail crossing authorization resolving similar challenges for mvp we continue to target a full in service date for the pipeline during 2020 and an overall project cost estimate of approximately 5 4 billion turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy for the fourth quarter of 2019 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 975 million or 1 99 per share nextera energy s fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 706 million or 1 44 per share respectively for the full year 2019 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 3 77 billion or 7 76 per share adjusted earnings were 4 06 billion or 8 37 per share for the corporate and other segment adjusted earnings for the full year decreased 0 35 per share compared to the 2018 prior comparable period primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the gulf power acquisition financing nextera energy also delivered strong operating cash flow growth which increased at a faster rate than the adjusted eps growth rate as expected during 2019 we also maintained our strong credit position based on the s p methodology we estimate that we ended the year at a 22 5 ffo to debt level versus our current downgrade threshold of 21 for moody s we expect 2019 cfo pre working capital to debt was 19 6 versus our current downgrade threshold of 18 nextera energy s cushion versus our credit metrics reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and supports the record roughly 14 billion of capital investments that we expect to make in 2020 the financial expectations that we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged we continue to expect that nextera energy s adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6 to 8 through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 plus the accretion of 0 15 and 0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2020 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 8 70 to 9 20 and as jim highlighted we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range this year we do expect that our adjusted eps growth will be more weighted toward the second half of the year for 2022 we expect to grow adjusted eps in the range of 6 to 8 off 2021 adjusted eps translating to a range of 10 00 to 10 75 per share from 2018 to 2022 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range as always all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions let me now turn to nextera energy partners which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2019 fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 280 million and cash available for distribution was 101 million an increase of 70 and 130 respectively this strong growth was driven primarily by the significant year over year growth in nextera energy partners portfolio including the 2019 acquisitions of the energy resources assets and the meade pipeline company as well as the full quarter s contribution from the portfolio of projects that were acquired in late 2018 for the full year 2019 adjusted ebitda was 1 1 billion up 25 year over year cash available for distribution excluding all contributions from our desert sunlight projects was 366 million an increase of 8 from the prior year including full contributions from the desert sunlight projects nextera energy partners achieve cafd growth of 20 versus 2018 similar to the quarterly results full year growth in both adjusted ebitda and cafd was primarily driven by portfolio growth the benefit from new projects was partially offset by the divestiture of canadian assets during 2018 cash available for distribution was also reduced by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results include the impact of idr fees which we treat as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide yesterday the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of 0 535 per common unit or 2 14 per unit on an annualized basis up 15 from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2019 as jim mentioned during 2019 nextera energy partners executed several financing for the benefit of lp unitholders in addition to raising approximately 1 2 billion of unsecured holding company notes which priced at some of the lowest spreads ever in the sector nextera energy partners also raised 1 4 billion of low cost project finance debt and executed 1 3 billion revolver extension nextera energy partners also raised 1 8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings with low initial coupons the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to lp unitholders allowing nextera energy partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth which will also as a result lower future financing needs in addition to reduced future asset and equity needs these financings provide nextera partners the flexibility to convert into common units at no discount over a long period of time this should be accretive to lp unitholders who retain all of the unit price upside as nextera energy partners executes on its expected distribution growth objectives these attributes combined with the significant flexibility that nextera partners retains those financings including the timing of conversion option to convert at any price option to pay the buyout in cash rather than units and the option to deploy the buyout amount into other assets should generate significant value to lp unitholders while also providing significant downside protection finally last quarter following the achievement of certain nextera energy partners unit trading thresholds we converted the second tranche of the convertible preferred securities that we issued in 2017 into additionally an additional roughly 4 7 million nextera energy partners common units further supporting our ongoing goal of using low cost financing products to layer in equity over time the nextera energy partners portfolio at year end 2019 supports the revised adjusted ebitda and cafd december 31 2019 run rate expectations that we announced at the time of the meade acquisition since nextera energy partners long term distribution growth expectations are supported without the need of additional asset acquisitions until 2021 the december 31 2020 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda and cafd remain unchanged at the same levels as the year end 2019 run rate expectations including full contributions from the pg e related projects year end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of 560 million to 640 million reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020 and assuming normal weather and operating conditions excluding all contributions from the desert sunlight projects nextera energy partners continues to expect a year end 2020 run rate for cafd in the range of 505 million to 585 million year end 2020 run rate adjusted ebitda expectations which assume full contributions from pg e related projects as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized are 1 225 billion to 1 4 billion as a reminder all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of 2 14 we continue to see 12 to 15 growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024 we expect that the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in february of 2021 to be in the range of 2 40 to 2 46 per common unit in summary we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have excellent prospects for growth fpl gulf power energy resources and nextera energy partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board the progress we made in 2019 reinforces our long term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute on in 2020 we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we ll open up the line for questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen at this time we ll begin the question and answer session our first question today comes from greg gordon from evercore isi please go ahead with your question greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks congratulations on another very very consistent year performance rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks greg good morning greg gordon evercore isi analyst couple of questions for you based on my back of the envelope math it doesn t look like you earned at the maximum allowable roe at florida power light this year can you tell us what where you landed on a return on equity basis for fiscal year 19 rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah greg from a reported regulatory roe standpoint so what ultimately goes to the florida public service commission we did earn the 11 6 roe as allowed under our settlement agreement you are right we did have some below the line expenses which is typical but those below the line expenses are excluded from that regulatory roe calculation greg gordon evercore isi analyst got you understood and then when you you point out in your slide deck that the majority of your the majority of your ptcs are now being allocated through tax equity there is a very clear slide in the appendix on that that means that we should be looking at nci on the balance sheet flowing through the income statement as the way that that s flowing through earnings now is that correct rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes that s correct greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay and the average amortization of a tax equity deal for a wind project is what approximately 10 years is that is that right rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah the earnings recognition is roughly coincident with the 10 year ptc range that are for all of our wind projects that are in ptcs greg gordon evercore isi analyst right and for solar deal that would be slightly faster rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah it s typically relates to the recognition of the itc period so for many tax equity structures that s over five years certain tax equity partners prefer a seven year structure and so then it would be over seven years as opposed to five greg gordon evercore isi analyst right and as you guys gear up for preparing for rate case in 2021 are there any milestones this year or will the majority of the activity be happening in early 21 rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer as you certainly appreciate there is a ton of milestones that are largely internal for our teams as they get ready for any rate proceeding and many of those preparation efforts started well before this year and are ongoing and we have the incremental work this year of doing all the analysis of thinking about bringing fpl and gulf together but as i highlighted in the prepared remarks based on what we know today our expectation is that we would file a rate case in early 21 for the new rates effective in 2022 and you know the first start of that would be the filing of the test year letter which we would expect to file in early 21 greg gordon evercore isi analyst great my last question is the battery storage backlog is obviously continuing to ramp are you buying battery storage sort of from are you buying the product from another vendor or are you buying the components from different oems and building your own bespoke battery storage product in other words are you using a vendor like fluence or one of the other sort of total product companies or are you sourcing components and building your own battery units rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s much more of the latter greg we see tremendous amount of value and are being able to have some nimbleness in where we procure the battery packs but then we also are procuring separately as you suggested the things like the containers and the other equipment that you would ultimately use to assemble the battery facility and then also we re designing our own management systems we ultimately believe that some of the real value add that we re going to be able to add to customers that will likely differentiate us from others is that battery system management because we ve talked about with you guys and with others over time that there is probably not one value stream that creates the value for batteries it s usually a couple of different applications within the same system and that management system and optimizing that is going to be part of the secret sauce of batteries so we ve invested a lot of time and energy and thinking through that not only on the energy resources deployments but also for the deployments that we ve had at fpl and we ve learned a tremendous amount and we re really excited as we highlighted in the prepared remarks about batteries as a terrific supplement to further renewables deployment certainly in the middle part of the next decade and thereafter as renewables become a significant component of the generation stack in the u s power markets greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks a lot rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research please go ahead with your question steve fleishman wolfe research analyst yeah hi good morning just a question first if you could update us on the santee cooper situation and your interest there and then secondly with jea now gone and stock obviously doing very well just kind of overall thought process on m a strategy and opportunities right now thanks james l robo chairman and chief executive officer so steve this is jim i ll take that obviously we re pretty limited in what we can say about the santee cooper situation other than what i ve said previously which is we remain very interested in santee cooper and we think south carolina is a terrific place to do business and that s probably all i can say about that on the jea front i would say we re disappointed that the sale process has been terminated we think we could have brought enormous value to the customers of and the citizens of jacksonville and we think it s unfortunate that it s been terminated but it is that is what it is and in terms of terms of future m a activity i will repeat what i ve been pretty consistent in terms of what our strategy is on that front which is we in terms of what we like we have been very focused first of all i don t think there is a utility in the country that wouldn t benefit from the application of our playbook that said we have been focused on opportunities in the southeast in the midwest as well as ferc regulated opportunities those are the from a regulatory standpoint and other opportunities what we think are the best fit for us and that remains our focus and we continue to be very interested in trying to do something that said m a is always hard and there are a lot of hurdles to get over and we will as always be extraordinarily financially disciplined you will never see us announce a deal that we say is strategic and has no accretion so anything that we do will have significant accretion associated with it so i think it s probably the sum total what i could say on that steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay one quick technical question just is there a quick and easy way you can quantify the balance sheet capacity available for these ffo to debt and metrics at moody s and s p in terms of dollars rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah we re probably not going to quantify it exactly steve as you ve heard us say quite a number of times over the years a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us we clearly have some room from our downgrade threshold which is certainly terrific and it s important to us as we think about how do we make sure that we re prepared for making investments that we want to make in the future including especially this year setting aside the comments that just jim just made on m a just for our organic growth prospects alone we have 14 billion of planned capital investment in our business and having a strong balance sheet as we start to make those investments is incredibly important steve fleishman wolfe research analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america please go with your question julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hey good morning can you hear me rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer good morning we can hear you just fine julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent so thanks again for all the commentary so perhaps kicking it off on the repowering front would just be curious on your thoughts on the 24 opportunity now given the ptc extension how does that shift your thinking and logic around incremental repower and i know you provided already some fairly detailed remarks on repowering already but i want to dig in on that specific opportunity especially given that that s a year already after the timeline for the solar itc here if you can elaborate rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer sure of course as we highlighted in our development expectations that we laid out this summer for the 2019 through 2022 time frame you ll note that the repowering opportunities that we saw were heavily and at that time exclusively in the 2019 to 2020 time frame we ve continued to work on opportunities to repower our assets at both in 80 ptc and a 60 ptc so first we ll focus on the 80 before we even think about the extensions of the if anything that s possible in 60 but remember there s always a trade off in making these investment opportunities part of the economic value of that is getting the new set of ptcs and so there is a balance of the cost of the investment that you need to make in that equipment and also ensuring that you can meet the irs test of the 80 20 valuation and as the ptc value goes down it gets a little bit harder to justify those in both of those requirements so again we thought it was a terrific program to create a huge amount of shareholder value really highlights the option value embedded in our portfolio and we ll continue to be creative and work toward creating more opportunities like that where things that are analogous to it in the future julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it excellent and just clarifying the last question a little bit you mentioned ferc regulated opportunities jim can you elaborate a little bit further on thought process there obviously this transmission roe question has been kind of lingering across the sectors just want to make sure we heard you right just how you re thinking about various ferc asset classes james l robo chairman and chief executive officer yeah so obviously we did the trans bay acquisition that s not in the midwest or the southeast and we do on a long term basis like ferc regulated assets notwithstanding the recent roe decision on the miso transmission owners listen i think there has been obviously that s an open docket at ferc right now i probably can t comment on what i think the outcomes are going to be there but other than to say i do believe ferc regulation will be constructive in the long term and we think in the long term it s a good place for us to deploy capital julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst and maybe jim if i can one more quickly on esg as you think about establishing targets and becoming a perhaps more prescriptive and being a leader on this front how do you think about being more specific on carbon i know this come up a little bit but i m curious on thought process there i know it s also a complicated too james l robo chairman and chief executive officer sure you know i think we have been i think pretty specific about what our 2025 goal is which is remember there all of these discussions are about percent reductions we started at an enormously lower level than the rest of the industry on just base co2 emissions per megawatt hour generated right and so any of the goals that we lay out which our goal is a 67 reduction off our 2005 base by 2025 i think if you went back and you looked at the 2005 average u s average that and compare to our nextera rate in 2025 to that 2005 average i m going to give you a number and everyone is going to go check me on it it s going to be that would be an 85 or 90 reduction relative to the 2005 u s average co2 emissions rate so we have a we re going to significantly decarbonize our company and our emissions and i m really excited about the goals we set i think they re very doable and what i m most excited about is the role that we can play both in florida and in the rest of the country in terms of leading the way to decarbonize not just the electric not just the electric sector but the transportation sector so we have there s lots more to do as i said in my prepared remarks i think the country has a lot more to do and the great news for the country and the economy is you can be clean and low cost at the same time and whatever we do will be for the benefit of customers and it would drive it will drive good economics better gdp growth for the country lower costs and obviously a better environmental profile julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thank you guys for the time i appreciate it operator our next question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim partners please go ahead with your question shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey good morning guys james l robo chairman and chief executive officer good morning shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst good morning so just on near backlog it s obviously very strong again so i m just trying to get a sense rebecca on sort of how much of that backlog increase mainly on the wind side was attributed to a pull forward of projects with the modest ptc extension versus a versus like actual incremental opportunities you re seeing as we think about modeling forward rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i don t think it s very much i think it s early obviously the ptc extension happened very very late in 2019 so i don t think we ve seen any impacts from it whatsoever coupled with the fact that it s quite a number of years down the road and it doesn t affect the profile of the ptc in the next three years which is really what was driving a lot of our customers actions in terms of the overall demand and how that s reflected as we ve said in the past we saw 2020 was going to be a significant development year clearly it is for wind and that 2021 is more likely than not to be roughly comparable with where we were in 2019 and we continue to see really strong interest from our customers about wind in the long term as they should be as jim highlighted the cost of wind and solar projects out in the mid 2020s assuming there are not any meaningful extensions of the incentives which is an assumption at this point that should be checked but assuming those incentives are not extended a very competitive versus existing coal nuclear plants and some less efficient gas fired plants so economic should continue to drive decisions for our customers for many many years to come shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it and then just lastly thanks for the incremental disclosures around gulf is there anything you can like maybe provide directionally on sort of the base assumptions you re assuming in 22 as we re thinking about your eps guidance i e may be from a regulatory construct or even addition to spending opportunities like the extension of sobra is there anything you can provide directionally on how you re thinking about this rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer not much beyond what we ve already talked about in terms of everything that s built into our expectations for 2020 through 2022 and as you recall from the investor conference materials we did lay out a lot of the detail for both businesses through 2021 and of course more detail for energy resources out in 22 but the fundamentals are very consistent with what we ve been doing for a long time on the regulated businesses again focusing on good capital investment that adds value for our customers and taking cost out of the business to ensure that we have very thoughtful views on customer bills and in the case of gulf power targeting a meaningful decline in the bills out to the mid 2020s so keep doing what we re doing and we couldn t be more excited about the growth opportunities for all of the businesses that lay out in front of us shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it so stay tuned around the cap structure and the reserve amortization now you re thinking about chewing up between the two utilities rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer absolutely shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst okay great congrats guys rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit suisse please go ahead with your question maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst hi this is maheep here on behalf of mike thanks for taking the questions just touching on the battery growth you re talking about can you talk about these reductions you re seeing on the battery systems for the projects in the pipe and would it be possible to quantify the scale of opportunity for retrofits on existing sites either at near or at nep rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer in terms of battery costs we ve laid out some of our thoughts and expectations i think most recently in our eei investor presentation we haven t broken that out between broken out a lot of the detail between battery pack and rest of the balance of system costs but everything that we ve laid out in terms of where we ve seen the market declines coming from in aggregate has really started to materialize and whereas two years ago we were surprised at how much faster costs were coming down we ve gotten more aggressive with our assumptions and now they re roughly consistent with what we were thinking we continue to be very optimistic longer term about batteries and is the whole industry has talked about it s really not about the power sector it s being driven much more by the electric vehicle sector and those drivers appear to be pretty clear for quite a number of years down the road which is really driving the manufacturing efficiencies and scale that we re seeing on the battery pack side so really excited and optimistic about where that business is headed maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst got it and could you just touch upon the retrofit opportunity for either neer or nep for batteries and would it be possible to get the tax credits on adding storage to an existing solar project rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes it could obviously be a significant opportunity coincident with the significant deployment of renewables particularly where the penetration is high adding batteries to existing solar sites could be very advantageous to the extent that they ve elected the itc and ultimately our charge are being used to charge the battery system yes they would qualify for itcs as long as we meet certain conditions so it s a terrific opportunity for the team but it s really consistent with what we ve been thinking about for the overall market opportunity and what we ve been highlighting for quite some time now to investors maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst got it and just one last question from me if you could talk about the impact on interest rates on nep s ability to execute the convertible refinancings thank you rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s been terrific low interest rate environment is obviously terrific for both of our businesses we love low cost of capital to be able to deploy these solutions as economically as possible for both our customers on the energy resources side as well as our regulated utilities and of course also for nextera energy partners so it s been terrific maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst thanks operator duration 65 minutes

inflation risks the reserve bank of india rbi held rates steady on thursday and retained an accommodative policy stance as it sought to support faltering growth and avoid stoking already high inflation levels the central bank has its work cut out as the economy is forecast to grow 5 in the year ending in march its weakest pace in 11 years a rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak in china has also heightened concerns around the world of a damaging blow to global growth economists polled by reuters had expected the rbi s monetary policy committee mpc to leave its key repo rate unchanged at 5 15 and reverse repo rate at 4 9 all six members of the mpc voted to keep rates steady and retain the accommodative monetary policy stance commentary anagha deodhar economist icici securities mumbai given the expected inflation trajectory we do believe there is room for one residual rate cut possibly in the august policy while inflation is likely to remain elevated until q2fy21 the room for easing will open up only at the beginning of q3 there are already some green shoots of recovery in manufacturing sustaining manufacturing momentum is important from a growth perspective improving credit flow to manufacturing units and ensuring better transmission of interest rates should be the primary focus the coronavirus could shave off 100bps from china s q1 gdp growth and around 30 basis points from annual growth hence sectors in india which are heavily dependent on china like base metals and chemicals could suffer deepthi mary mathew economist geojit financial services kochi it was an expected move by the rbi maintaining the repo rate unchanged at 5 15 with the inflation rate breaching the upper band it will take time for the central bank to revive the rate cuts by maintaining an accommodative stance there is scope for rate cuts once the inflation rate falls back to a comfortable level prithviraj srinivas chief economist axis capital mumbai there is more steam left in the rbi s rate cutting cycle but very limited maximum another 25 to 50 basis points and that depends on how quickly the food inflation shock dissipates looking at the central bank s cpi inflation trajectory it is safe to say rbi could wait to see how the next monsoon rains pan out before taking a call to lower policy rates we believe that the budget s impact on growth is neutral joseph thomas head of research emkay wealth management mumbai in the recent policy pronouncements the rbi had very clearly indicated that the requirements of growth should get precedence over stability against the conditions of sluggish economic growth and the fall in consumption and investment demand it was widely expected that the rbi was likely to continue with the pause till there is greater visibility on the inflation front at this juncture rate modification is not required as the interbank market has a huge surplus of close 3 trillion rupees 42 08 billion to support the liquidity requirements of the system and this alone will ensure that the short term rates do not move up garima kapoor economist institutional equities elara capital mumbai the recent high prints of cpi inflation have altered the rbi s rate cutting trajectory while cpi inflation will cool off from the recent highs as vegetable prices ease we are unlikely to see inflation cooling below 6 until june 2020 we continue to expect the mpc to stay on hold through cy2020 given the still subdued growth outlook and elevated trajectory for cpi inflation till mid 2020 we believe any room for a rate cut may only emerge towards q4fy20 there isn t any impact from the coronavirus outbreak in india as yet but it needs to be watched very closely especially since the pace at which it is spreading is swift the disruption of global supply chains and its ramifications for india need to be watched closely shubhada rao chief economist yes bank mumbai the rbi s rate decision is in line with expectations it is likely to maintain a status quo in the near term with an inflation forecast of 3 2 factored in for q3 fy21 in conjunction with our forecast we expect rbi rate action in october 2020 monetary policy we expect 25 bps rate cut then rupa rege nitsure group chief economist l t financial holdings mumbai today s monetary policy response is the most optimum in the current circumstances by keeping the stance at accommodative by granting crr exemption against the loans given to the stressed sectors and extending a one time restructuring for msmes etc the policy has strengthened the stimulus package announced by the union budget reuters 1 15 pm rbi has many other tools to revive growth not just interest rates das after leaving benchmark interest rates rates unchanged in the second consecutive policy review rbi governor shaktikanta das on thursday said the central bank has many other instruments to address the sluggishness the economy not just interest rates the reserve bank of india rbi in its sixth bi monthly

instruments to address the sluggishness in the growth momentum das told reporters at the customary post policy conference the monetary policy committee mpc kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 5 15 per cent continuing with the accommodative stance to revive growth the governor said the continuity in policy from last pause should not be read as a pointer to future actions while the decision is as

reserve bank of india on thursday revised upwards its retail inflation projection for the last quarter of the current fiscal to 6 5 per cent owing to likely increase in input costs for milk and pulses amid volatile crude oil prices going forward the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors like food inflation crude prices and input costs for services rbi said on food inflation rbi said it is likely to soften from the high levels registered in december and the decline is expected to become more pronounced during the fourth quarter of this fiscal as onion prices ease following arrivals of late kharif and rabi harvests the reserve bank of india rbi said in its last bi monthly monetary policy revealed on thursday besides crude prices are likely to remain volatile due to unabated geo political tensions in the middle east on one hand and uncertain global economic outlook on the other moreover there has been an increase in input costs for services in recent months it added the rbi has kept the key repo rate unchanged to 5 15 per cent taking into consideration these factors and under the assumption of a normal south west monsoon in 2020 21 the cpi inflation projection is revised upwards to 6 5 per cent for q4 2019 20 january march 2020 5 4 5 per cent for h1 2020 21 april september 2020 and 3 2 per cent for q3 2020 21 october december with risks broadly balanced rbi said the recent pick up in prices of non vegetable food items specifically in milk due to a rise in input costs and pulses due to a shortfall in kharif production are all likely to sustain rbi said rbi further said that the actual inflation outcome for q2 at 5 8 per cent overshot projections by 70 bps primarily due to the intensification of the onion price shock in december 2019 on account of unseasonal rains in october november in its previous monetary policy in december 2019 as well the rbi had raised its inflation projection to 5 1 4 7 per cent for the second half of the current fiscal on the back of spike in prices of vegetables such as onion and tomatoes pti 12 30 pm rbi estimates gdp to expand at 6 in fy21 the reserve bank of india on thursday projected the

continues to be weak and the output gap remains negative real gdp growth for 2019 20 was projected at 5 per cent in the december 2019 policy the central bank said that for 2020 21 the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors including level of private consumption and external factors it said private consumption particularly in rural areas is expected to recover on the back of improved rabi crop prospects the recent rise in food prices has shifted the terms of trade in favour of agriculture which will support rural incomes the easing of global trade uncertainties should encourage exports and spur investment activity it said the breakout of the coronavirus may however impact tourist arrivals and global trade it added also the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the union budget 2020 21 should support domestic demand along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending taking into consideration different factors rbi said gdp growth for 2020 21 is

did donald trump take over the republican party or was it the other way around yes trump s multi front trade war was a violent break from gop economic orthodoxy but in many other ways on policy the president has been a traditional republican he s cut taxes for rich people and corporations he s slashed regulations and he s appointed conservative federal judges even the twist and turns of his protectionist trade policies have seemed closely attuned to the reactions of the donor base as expressed through the stock market president trump s state of the union address however suggests a second term might contain far less deference to traditional party priorities and the desires of business and wealthy donors while it wasn t a speech heavy on new policy initiatives the absence of much talk about taxes is noteworthy tax cuts have been the raison d etre of the modern gop and every tax cut once passed has merely set the stage for the next round of rate reductions in president reagan s re election year sotu in 1984 he not only praised at length the results of his sweeping 1981 tax cuts but promised even more dramatic tax reform in the years ahead trump though decided other issues were more deserving of focus while he did briefly credit his 2017 tax cuts and jobs for helping to rapidly revive an already growing economy that was about it for taxes instead of the traditional republican call to revamp the tax code in the name of faster gdp growth and simplicity trump merely urged congress to pass a tax credit scholarship for contributions to state sanctioned scholarship funds to help parents pay private and religious school expenses not the sort of pro growth tax cut that reaganite supply siders care much about maybe but it s an important policy goal of trump s conservative christian base advertisement advertisement and that tax credit idea was hardly trump s only sotu shout out to family first and nationalist populist conservatives trump described his agenda as relentlessly pro worker pro family pro growth and most of all pro american that sounds a lot like the rhetoric from market skeptic republican thinkers such as hillbilly elegy author j d vance who speaks of pro family pro worker pro american nation conservatism instead of business tax cuts or more deregulation the few policies trump did mention were pretty much oriented toward such republicans who think globalization and technology have caused too much societal disruption in addition to the religious tax credits trump pushed immigration reform suing sanctuary cities infrastructure spending and lowering drug prices he also endorsed a bipartisan proposal in congress to extend paid leave to families after the birth or adoption of a child if trump wins a second term this november it s reasonable to expect similar policy impulses sure he might propose more tax cuts but they are more likely to be payroll tax cuts geared toward middle class workers instead of income tax cuts for rich people and corporations he ll look for a new federal reserve chair less worried about inflation than current boss jerome powell who deserves at least partial credit for the surging stock market and continuing expansion trump will let the national debt soar rather than trimming projected medicare and social security benefits and there will be more protectionism although it may be called industrial policy in other words trump will ignore the traditional economic policy advice rich republicans read about in the economist financial times or wall street journal and the donors might be fine with all that the trump tax cuts were sizable and they re not going away anytime soon so that s a big long term win more importantly perhaps is that just as religious conservatives see trump as protecting them from an evermore secular and hostile culture wealthier republicans see trump as a bulwark against rising socialism democratic or otherwise of course there s nothing new about republicans using that label against liberals and progressives but these days it s more than just a taunt two of the democratic party s most popular national politicians sen bernie sanders and rep alexandria ocasio cortez call themselves socialists and question whether billionaires should even exist and even top democrats who prefer the capitalist label like sen elizabeth warren are proposing large income and wealth taxes given that unpalatable alternative wealthy conservatives understandably aren t going to worry so much about trump tinkering with tariffs yet why should trump who ll be 74 on election day and unable to run for a third term care so much about pleasing family first conservatives and the party s white working class voters well politics is the new trump family business and donald jr and ivanka are among republican voters top picks for the gop presidential nomination in 2024 that means trump isn t just the patriarch of a rich and powerful family he also needs to help maintain the intergenerational trump political brand advertisement advertisement in one way at least trump is just as family first as his loyal followers want more essential commentary and analysis

incurred 4 5 million in costs primarily third party expenses to reconstruct the accounts receivables subledger in the third quarter of 2019 we were able to identify 4 0 million of revenues billed and collected in prior periods which had never been recorded in the general ledger we also identified and recorded 0 3 million in bank fees which had been incurred in prior periods the rebuild of the subledger was completed during the third quarter of 2019 based on the reconstructed subledger we were able to analyze and quantify the uncollected receivables from prior periods although we plan to attempt to collect these receivables we estimated an increase to bad debt expense of 13 7 million in the third quarter of 2019 the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts was adjusted in the fourth quarter of 2019 for an additional 6 4 million and will be adjusted in future periods if needed as assumptions related to the collectability of these accounts receivable change out of the total 20 1 million in bad debt expense recorded in the second half of 2019 19 2 million represented an allowance on 34 0 million of accounts receivable or 56 due to the unusual nature of this internal loss

did donald trump take over the republican party or was it the other way around yes trump s multi front trade war was a violent break from gop economic orthodoxy but in many other ways on policy the president has been a traditional republican he s cut taxes for rich people and corporations he s slashed regulations and he s appointed conservative federal judges even the twist and turns of his protectionist trade policies have seemed closely attuned to the reactions of the donor base as expressed through the stock market president trump s state of the union address however suggests a second term might contain far less deference to traditional party priorities and the desires of business and wealthy donors while it wasn t a speech heavy on new policy initiatives the absence of much talk about taxes is noteworthy tax cuts have been the raison d etre of the modern gop and every tax cut once passed has merely set the stage for the next round of rate reductions in president reagan s re election year sotu in 1984 he not only praised at length the results of his sweeping 1981 tax cuts but promised even more dramatic tax reform in the years ahead vice president mike pence an speaker of the house nancy pelosi d ca listen as u s president donald trump delivers the state of the union address to a joint session of the u s congress in the house chamber of the u s capitol in washington u s february 4 2020 via reuters joshua robert trump though decided other issues were more deserving of focus while he did briefly credit his 2017 tax cuts and jobs for helping to rapidly revive an already growing economy that was about it for taxes instead of the traditional republican call to revamp the tax code in the name of faster gdp growth and simplicity trump merely urged congress to pass a tax credit scholarship for contributions to state sanctioned scholarship funds to help parents pay private and religious school expenses not the sort of pro growth tax cut that reaganite supply siders care much about maybe but it s an important policy goal of trump s conservative christian base and that tax credit idea was hardly trump s only sotu shout out to family first and nationalist populist conservatives trump described his agenda as relentlessly pro worker pro family pro growth and most of all pro american that sounds a lot like the rhetoric from market skeptic republican thinkers such as hillbilly elegy author j d vance who speaks of pro family pro worker pro american nation conservatism instead of business tax cuts or more deregulation the few policies trump did mention were pretty much oriented toward such republicans who think globalization and technology have caused too much societal disruption in addition to the religious tax credits trump pushed immigration reform suing sanctuary cities infrastructure spending and lowering drug prices he also endorsed a bipartisan proposal in congress to extend paid leave to families after the birth or adoption of a child if trump wins a second term this november it s reasonable to expect similar policy impulses sure he might propose more tax cuts but they are more likely to be payroll tax cuts geared toward middle class workers instead of income tax cuts for rich people and corporations he ll look for a new federal reserve chair less worried about inflation than current boss jerome powell who deserves at least partial credit for the surging stock market and continuing expansion trump will let the national debt soar rather than trimming projected medicare and social security benefits and there will be more protectionism although it may be called industrial policy in other words trump will ignore the traditional economic policy advice rich republicans read about in the economist financial times or wall street journal and the donors might be fine with all that the trump tax cuts were sizable and they re not going away anytime soon so that s a big long term win more importantly perhaps is that just as religious conservatives see trump as protecting them from an evermore secular and hostile culture wealthier republicans see trump as a bulwark against rising socialism democratic or otherwise of course there s nothing new about republicans using that label against liberals and progressives but these days it s more than just a taunt two of the democratic party s most popular national politicians sen bernie sanders and rep alexandria ocasio cortez call themselves socialists and question whether billionaires should even exist and even top democrats who prefer the capitalist label like sen elizabeth warren are proposing large income and wealth taxes given that unpalatable alternative wealthy conservatives understandably aren t going to worry so much about trump tinkering with tariffs yet why should trump who ll be 74 on election day and unable to run for a third term care so much about pleasing family first conservatives and the party s white working class voters well politics is the new trump family business and donald jr and ivanka are among republican voters top picks for the gop presidential nomination in 2024 that means trump isn t just the patriarch of a rich and powerful family he also needs to help maintain the intergenerational trump political brand in one way at least trump is just as family first as his loyal followers

did donald trump take over the republican party or was it the other way around yes trump s multi front trade war was a violent break from gop economic orthodoxy but in many other ways on policy the president has been a traditional republican he s cut taxes for rich people and corporations he s slashed regulations and he s appointed conservative federal judges even the twist and turns of his protectionist trade policies have seemed closely attuned to the reactions of the donor base as expressed through the stock market president trump s state of the union address however suggests a second term might contain far less deference to traditional party priorities and the desires of business and wealthy donors while it wasn t a speech heavy on new policy initiatives the absence of much talk about taxes is noteworthy tax cuts have been the raison d etre of the modern gop and every tax cut once passed has merely set the stage for the next round of rate reductions in president reagan s re election year sotu in 1984 he not only praised at length the results of his sweeping 1981 tax cuts but promised even more dramatic tax reform in the years ahead trump though decided other issues were more deserving of focus while he did briefly credit his 2017 tax cuts and jobs for helping to rapidly revive an already growing economy that was about it for taxes instead of the traditional republican call to revamp the tax code in the name of faster gdp growth and simplicity trump merely urged congress to pass a tax credit scholarship for contributions to state sanctioned scholarship funds to help parents pay private and religious school expenses not the sort of pro growth tax cut that reaganite supply siders care much about maybe but it s an important policy goal of trump s

as relentlessly pro worker pro family pro growth and most of all pro american that sounds a lot like the rhetoric from market skeptic republican thinkers such as hillbilly elegy author j d vance who speaks of pro family pro worker pro american nation conservatism instead of business tax cuts or more deregulation the few policies trump did mention were pretty much oriented toward such republicans who think globalization and technology have caused too much societal disruption in addition to the religious tax credits trump pushed immigration reform suing sanctuary cities infrastructure spending and lowering drug prices he also endorsed a bipartisan proposal in congress to extend paid leave to families after the birth or adoption of a child if trump wins a second term this november it s reasonable to expect similar policy impulses sure he might propose more tax cuts but they are more likely to be payroll tax cuts geared toward middle class workers instead of income tax cuts for rich people and corporations he ll look for a new federal reserve chair less worried about inflation than current boss jerome powell who deserves at least partial credit for the surging stock market and continuing expansion trump will let the national debt soar rather than trimming projected medicare and social security benefits and there will be more protectionism although it may be called industrial policy in other words trump will ignore the traditional economic policy advice rich republicans read about in the economist financial times or wall street journal and the donors might be fine with all that the trump tax cuts were sizable and they re not going away anytime soon so that s a big long term win more importantly perhaps is that just as religious conservatives see trump as protecting them from an evermore secular and hostile culture wealthier republicans see trump as a bulwark against rising socialism democratic or otherwise of course there s nothing new about republicans using that label against liberals and progressives but these days it s more than just a taunt two of the democratic party s most popular national politicians sen bernie sanders and rep alexandria ocasio cortez call themselves socialists and question whether billionaires should even exist and even top democrats who prefer the capitalist label like sen elizabeth warren are proposing large income and wealth taxes given that unpalatable alternative wealthy conservatives understandably aren t going to worry so much about trump tinkering with tariffs yet why should trump who ll be 74 on election day and unable to run for a third term care so much about pleasing family first conservatives and the party s white working class voters well politics is the new trump family business and donald jr and ivanka are among republican voters top picks for the gop presidential nomination in 2024 that means trump isn t just the patriarch of a rich and powerful family he also needs to help maintain the intergenerational trump political brand in one way at least trump is just as family first as his loyal followers want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight

australian dollar remains the strongest one for the week while markets are back in risk on mode fears over china s coronavirus seem to have subsided with s p 500 and nasdaq new record highs 10 year

minor resistance in aud usd is a level to watch to see whether dollar or aussie would win the race as long as 0 6777 holds near term outlook stays bearish and break of 0 6670 low will resume medium

material change to us economy due to coronavirus san francisco fed president mary daly told cnbc that monetary policy is now in a really good position uncertainties like us china trade tensions receded while hard brexit was avoided the three rate cuts last year puts the us economy in a good place to weather these storms like china s coronavirus she added that china s coronavirus bears further watching and of course we are keeping a close eye but right now i am not looking for this to do anything material to our economy she expected china to has a couple of quarters perhaps of weaker growth but then bounce back once this has been resolved and then that to have a temporary impact on the us economy and go away once things have been resolved china coronavirus deaths hit 563

nevertheless the pull back is so far relatively shallow and is contained above 6 9526 minor support further rise remains mildly in favor sustained break of near term channel resistance will indicate bullish reversal for 7 0867 resistance however break of 6 9526 will indicate completion of rebound from 6 8452 and keep the decline from 7 1953 intact the next move will depend on the breakthrough in

australia nab business confidence unchanged at 1 more rba support still needed australia nab business confidence was unchanged at 1 in q4 current business conditions improved from 2 to 4 however business conditions for the next three months dropped from 10 to 9 for the next 12 months dropped from 20 to 16 alan oster nab group chief economist the survey broadly fits with our overall read of the economy a weak private sector particularly in the consumer space and only modest inflation pressure there also appears some risk around the outlook for the labour market and business investment we think more policy support is needed and that this is still likely to occur in 2020 but for now the rba appears in wait and see mode with labour market conditions still faring well looking ahead ecb

would add to the case that corrective rebound from 1 0879 has completed at 1 1239 in this case deeper decline would be seen back to retest 1 0879 low on the upside break of 1 1095 will turn bias to the upside for 1 1172 resistance instead in the bigger picture rebound from 1 0879 is seen as a corrective move at this point in case of another rise upside should be limited by 38 2 retracement of 1 2555 to 1 0879 at 1 1519 and down trend from 1 2555 2018 high would resume at a later stage however sustained break of 1 1519 will dampen this bearish view and bring stronger rise to 61 8 retracement

ghana on tuesday became the first ever country in africa to issue a 41 year bond successfully raising three billion dollars in the international debt capital markets despite concerns raised over the coronavirus and its potential adverse impact on market conditions for emerging markets in general a diverse investor base largely from europe and the us supported tuesday s issuance translating into a peak order book in excess of 15 billion five times the amount required the sterling investor s confidence in the country has been demonstrated by the competitive rate of 8 75 at which the 41 year weighted average life wal tranche the longest ever tenor bond issued by an african issuer was issued compared to a rate of 8 95 31 year bond issued in 2019 the bond issuance comes two weeks after international ratings agency moody s gave a resounding vote of confidence in ghana s economy with a positive outlook this was made possible following a three day road show in a series of fixed income investor meetings in new york boston and london where ghana issued a second tri trance eurobond transaction under its international capital markets programme the transaction comprised 1 25 billion six year wal a billion dollar 14 year wal and 750 million 41 year wal priced at a coupon rate of 6 375 7 875 and 8 750 respectively stellar macroeconomic fundamentals ghana s growth rebounded strongly from 3 4 in 2016 to 8 1 in 2017 before moderating to 6 3 in 2018 it may be recalled that in 2016 ghana issued a six year eurobond at 9 250 compared to tuesday s six year bond at 6 375 a staggering 288 basis points improvement in may 2017 fitch affirmed the country s rating at b and revised the outlook to stable while s p in october 2018 upgraded the country s rating from b to b with a stable outlook in january 2020 moody s revised the country s outlook from stable to positive growth has averaged seven per cent from 2017 and inflation on the other hand fell from 15 4 in december 2016 to 7 9 new series in december 2019 the lowest rate in recent times the cedi which has remained relatively stable against the country s major trading currencies since 2017 appreciated in january 2020 against the us dollar according to mr ofori atta the proceeds for the bonds will support government s budget for infrastructure the restructuring of the energy and financial services sectors and a liability management exercise in an interview with bloomberg finance minister ken ofori atta said government was considering expanding the country s tax base to lessen its debt risk i think yesterday s was successful three billion dollars in three tranches seven 14 and 41 and we had a 15 billion book to work with so clearly the markets have rallied in support of ghana post imf and that is good indication for the future for us he said coronavirus threat answering a question on whether the coronavirus threat could affect the issuance of more bonds the minister said ghana was not going to go to the international capital market until 2021 i think clearly for africa the commodities issue will be impacted coffee is down by some 20 per cent copper is about nine per cent or so and then crude oil is 17 per cent but clearly the market was looking for a ghana paper confident in the future so we are quite comfortable that this is a paper to hold he said further commenting on whether the debt to gdp was going to get worse based on the imf s 63 per cent estimate at the end of december 2019 mr ofori atta said what ghana had with the imf was the financial sector restructuring which ghana had to pay for and the energy sector restructuring debt to gdp touching on this he stated if you net all of those ones out we are around 58 per cent or so of debt to gdp but the key to all of these is the export booster we are expecting and this will be outside of commodity if you look at our non oil production contribution that s about 5 4 per cent growth compared to oil growth so we have a much more diversified economy than most and we expect to do that as you know the continental free trade act headquarters is going to be in ghana which means we are really going to be the pass through for investment and trade into the future we are banking on ghana becoming a regional hub with regard to financial services aviation and logistics trade etc so for us once we get through the rigidities and get to profiling we are confident with increase in revenue and exports in other areas we should do well march ipo but we are confident and we are targeting march for the ipo which will further go to strengthen our foreign exchange reserves and also diversify the economy into a modern economy and take advantage of branding as the largest gold exporter on the continent we look to bring the 58 per cent debt to gdp further down currently our domestic revenue mobilization is where we need to look at ghana is currently about 12 5 per cent revenue to gdp compared to our peers who are about 18 per cent we are just about completing our national identification drive so the tax base would be broadened and we will very soon be depending on that to fill the gap rather than on debt he said source

over to scott scott hall president and chief executive officer thanks whit thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results for 2020 we had a very good start to 2020 as we generated solid organic consolidated net sales growth improved margins and increased adjusted ebitda in the quarter our net sales increased 10 3 driven by the benefit of the krausz acquisition with organic net sales increasing 3 1 both higher pricing and increased shipment volumes of our core infrastructure products drove our organic net sales increase we increased our gross margin by 290 basis points to over 34 in the quarter higher pricing favorable product mix and the addition of krausz more than offset increased costs from tariffs and inflation both infrastructure and technologies contributed to the gross margin improvement in the quarter i was especially pleased to see technologies achieve breakeven adjusted ebitda in the quarter this performance and the addition of krausz helped deliver nearly 20 consolidated adjusted ebitda growth during the quarter we settled the walter energy tax liability with a 22 2 million payment to the irs after a significant effort managing and resolving a complex situation over the past four years regarding the obligation of our onetime parent company we can finally put this matter behind us for fiscal 2020 we expect to see continued favorable demand in our end markets driven by healthy municipal spending and improved residential construction however we remain cautiously optimistic due to continued uncertainty from global and domestic matters after a solid start to the year we are increasing our expectations for both net sales and adjusted ebitda growth for fiscal 2020 which i will discuss in more detail later in the call with that i ll turn the call over to martie martie zakas chief financial officer thanks scott and good morning everyone i will begin with our first quarter consolidated gaap and non gaap financial results then review our segment performance our consolidated net sales for the quarter increased 10 3 or 19 8 million to 212 6 million this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of krausz as well as higher pricing and increased shipment volumes at infrastructure as scott mentioned we achieved organic net sales growth of 3 1 in the quarter our gross profit this quarter increased 20 8 or 12 5 million to 72 6 million gross margin of 34 1 improved 290 basis points over the prior year this improvement was primarily due to higher pricing product mix and the addition of krausz and was partially offset by higher costs associated with tariffs and inflation and approximately 500 000 of start up costs associated with our large casting foundry expansion in chattanooga selling general and administrative expenses were 49 9 million in the quarter an 8 9 million increase over the prior year the increase was primarily due to the addition of sg a from krausz which accounted for about half of the increase and it related activities personnel related costs and professional fees sg a as a percent of net sales was 23 and a half percent in the first quarter compared to 21 3 in the prior year our current expectations for full year 2020 are for total sg a expenses to be about 20 of consolidated net sales operating income increased 27 7 to 20 3 million in the first quarter compared to 15 9 million in the prior year operating income included strategic reorganization and other charges of 2 4 million in the quarter versus 3 2 million in the prior year turning now to our consolidated non gaap results adjusted operating income increased 18 8 or 3 6 million to 22 7 million in the quarter both infrastructure and technologies increased adjusted operating performance in the quarter which was partially offset by higher corporate sg a expenses adjusted ebitda for the quarter increased 19 and a half percent or 6 1 million to 37 4 million adjusted ebitda margin improved 140 basis points to 17 6 consolidated adjusted ebitda conversion margin was 31 for the last 12 months adjusted ebitda was 204 4 million or 20 7 of net sales as compared with the prior 12 month period we have increased latest 12 months adjusted ebitda 10 3 or 19 1 million and improved adjusted ebitda margin 80 basis points net interest expense for the 2020 first quarter was 7 4 million as compared to 5 5 million in the prior year quarter the increase in net interest expense in the quarter resulted from a noncash adjustment to capitalized interest and decreased interest income due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates our updated full year 2020 expectations are for net interest expense to be between 24 million and 25 million income tax expense was 3 1 million or 23 1 of income before tax as compared with an income tax benefit of 5 9 million or 21 9 of loss before tax in the prior year quarter the prior year quarter included a 7 7 million tax benefit on the walter energy accrual we continue to expect our effective tax rate for 2020 will be between 24 and 26 our adjusted net income per share increased to 0 08 for the quarter compared to 0 07 in the prior year turning now to segment performance starting with infrastructure infrastructure net sales increased 12 1 or 20 8 million to 192 8 million in the quarter this increase was due to 13 8 million in sales from krausz and a 4 1 increase in organic net sales this quarter which was primarily driven by higher pricing and increased shipment volumes of our core products adjusted operating income for the quarter increased 15 5 or 4 8 million to 35 7 million the increase was primarily due to higher pricing product mix increased shipment volumes and the inclusion of krausz partially offset by higher costs associated with tariffs and inflation increased sg a expenses and approximately 500 000 of start up costs previously mentioned adjusted ebitda for the quarter increased 16 3 or 6 7 million to 47 7 million yielding an adjusted ebitda margin of 24 7 and a conversion margin of 32 in the quarter moving on to technologies technologies net sales decreased 1 million to 19 8 million in the quarter driven by lower shipment volumes at metrology which were partially offset by higher volumes at echologics adjusted operating loss improved 1 7 million from the loss of 3 7 million in the prior year primarily due to product mix and higher pricing partially offset by lower shipment volumes and higher costs associated with inflation technologies adjusted ebitda also improved 1 7 million in the quarter to breakeven as compared with a loss of 1 7 million in the prior year concluding with liquidity cash used in operating activities for the first quarter was 12 4 million with negative free cash flow of 27 6 million both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were impacted by the 22 2 million payment associated with the walter tax settlement as a reminder our cash generation is generally stronger in the second half of our fiscal year due to the seasonality of our business we invested 15 2 million in capital expenditures in the period which was similar to the first quarter of the prior year we continue to expect our capital expenditures will be between 80 million and 90 million for 2020 at december 31 2019 we had total debt of 446 4 million and cash and cash equivalents of 136 8 million at the end of the first quarter our net debt leverage ratio was one and a half times finally on october 1st we adopted new accounting requirements for leases as a result we recorded assets and liabilities of approximately 30 million each related to our operating leases which had previously not been recorded on the balance sheet i ll turn the call back to scott to talk more about our results and outlook for 2020 scott hall president and chief executive officer thanks martie i will provide some additional insights into key areas and then comment on our full year 2020 outlook after that we ll open the call up for questions going forward we are continuing to focus on executing our key strategic priorities these include accelerating new product development developing a fully integrated technology platform for infrastructure monitoring driving operational excellence and modernizing our manufacturing facilities our goal is to deliver above market organic net sales growth and improvements in our margins from productivity initiatives and continued price cost realization our organic net sales in the first quarter performed well as we benefited from higher pricing as well as higher volumes in our core valve and hydrant and leak detection products during the quarter our natural gas and metrology product sales experienced headwinds versus the prior year our natural gas product sales experienced what we believe is a temporary slowdown in sales we expect that sales will improve through the balance of the year as our end markets normalize for metrology products our 2019 sales benefited from a significantly stronger backlog entering the year our current backlog is meaningfully lower than the prior year due to an inconsistent pipeline of large orders as a result we expect our metrology sales to be flat this year in recent years we have focused on developing stronger partnerships in the distribution channel as a result we have enhanced our partnership with ferguson one of our largest customers for many of our metrology products and have seen a greater percentage of our metrology sales go through their distribution channel recently we worked with ferguson to win a 34 million multiyear ami water meter contract for newport news virginia this contract win is an example of how we were able to differentiate ourselves with our technology for remote disconnect meters we could start benefiting from orders associated with this contract in the fourth quarter of this year i was pleased with the gross margin improvement we generated in the quarter this was driven by a combination of increased volumes of our core valve and hydrants which are some of our higher margin products and improved price realization during the first quarter we benefited from carryover pricing which included two price increases for iron products and more than offset the impact of the increased costs from tariffs and inflation we recently announced additional price increases in the u s and canadian markets for many of our infrastructure products which will be effective in february and march the timing of these announcements is comparable to the prior year although raw material costs are not currently contributing to inflation we expect this higher pricing will help offset the anticipated increases in material costs and other inflation for the balance of the year the execution of our key capital investment projects to accelerate the modernization of our manufacturing facilities equipment and processes is well under way we have major projects driving capital spending above historical levels in order to both deliver above market sales growth by broadening our product capabilities and expand gross margins as we have previously discussed we have three large projects under way including the large casting foundry expansion in chattanooga tennessee a new brass foundry in decatur illinois and a new specialty valve manufacturing facility in kimball tennessee these transformational projects are forecasted to account for approximately 130 million of capital spending based on current time lines we expect that these projects together will drive approximately 30 million of incremental gross profit in 2023 through both operational efficiencies and sales growth as mentioned previously we expect capital expenditures as a percent of consolidated net sales to decrease to less than 4 in fiscal 2023 we have nearly completed the large casting foundry expansion in chattanooga we expect to begin producing product with our own casting by the end of the second quarter as a reminder this was a large multiyear investment in our chattanooga facility to expand domestic manufacturing capabilities for large valves and introduce additive manufacturing technologies to our foundries this includes one of the largest 3d printers in the world which will help decrease time to develop new tooling and shorten turnaround times for our customers this investment will help us further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace historically we have focused on small valves which are less than 12 inches as they are used much more frequently increased population density and urbanization are driving a greater need for large valve sizes although today the market for large gate valves in north america is less than 30 of the gate valve market we expect large gate valve to grow at a faster rate than small valves as a result this investment will add additional flexibility and capabilities for new product development and help us provide a broader range of products to our customers in addition it helps with product efficiencies through in sourcing and provides more products which will satisfy our customers made in america specifications with less reliance on sourcing valve bodies from china as with any large project and new capabilities we expect there to be a ramp up this year and anticipate that we will ultimately recognize the benefit of this project in fiscal 2021 the impact of the start up costs until full ramp up of these new operations is included in our annual guidance and was 500 000 this quarter i will wrap up my comments with a review of our updated expectations for full year 2020 results during fiscal 2020 we expect to see favorable demand in our end markets driven by healthy municipal spending and improved residential construction the residential construction market appears to be improving based on the housing start data reported for our first quarter it s still early in the year and we continue to see a wide range of predictions for housing growth in 2020 for our fiscal year we anticipate residential construction growing in the low single digit range municipal spending which accounts for the majority of our end markets continues to be healthy for our fiscal year we expect the municipal end market will grow in the low single digit range despite continued uncertainty from global and domestic matters we are increasing our expectations for growth in both net sales and adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2020 based on our current expectations for end market growth we anticipate that our 2020 full year consolidated net sales growth will be at the high end of the 3 to 5 range we previously provided this growth will be driven by higher pricing increased shipment volumes and the contribution from krausz in the first quarter additionally we expect adjusted ebitda growth to be at the high end of the 4 to 8 range we previously provided i am confident that we are in position to accelerate our transformation to become a municipal and residential solutions company with a growing percentage of our products incorporating technology the traditionally conservative water and wastewater utilities are increasingly more open to using digital tools to deliver more benefits to their stakeholders with limited resources not to mention many face significant challenges from the aging infrastructure we expect technology enabled products to achieve significantly higher growth rates than some of the traditional products in the water utility industry in fact the overall digital water market is expected to grow at a 6 5 compound annual growth rate between 2019 and 2030 as forecasted by bluefield research the segments most relevant to our growth strategies like asset network and information management are forecasted to grow even faster with our market leading positions and extensive installed base of infrastructure products we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends today we have a number of products addressing these segments including echologics pipe condition assessment services and fixed leak detection solutions metrology s advanced meters and communications equipment smart hydrants pressure and water quality monitors and most recently our sentryx software platform in summary we are well on our way to incorporating technology into our infrastructure products while also modernizing our manufacturing facilities and operations as a result we believe we will be able to deliver above market sales growth and drive margin expansion and earnings growth while also continuing to return cash to shareholders and with that operator please open the call for questions questions answers operator and the first question in the queue is from michael wood with nomura instinet your line is now open michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning great job this quarter infrastructure gross margins stepped up versus last quarter despite the seasonally slower sales was there anything unusual there i know you typically experience a seasonal gross profit margin decline so i d love it if you can just talk about what drove margins higher whether they re sustainable and how that compared to your expectations scott hall president and chief executive officer yeah as we said in the prepared comments i think it was a combination of things certainly infrastructure the gross impact along with pricing were probably the two largest driving items and then the mix that we mentioned that we got with the hydrants and r d trials being a larger portion of sales also skewed the margins so as long as we re talking about sustainability i believe as long as we keep those kinds of mixes with ivh and we ll have favorable trends throughout the year michael wood nomura instinet analyst and how should we think about the three projects contributing to that 30 million of gross margin improvement is it roughly 10 million each one larger or smaller than the other and can you just talk about how long it takes once the plant is up and running to get the planned efficiencies scott hall president and chief executive officer yeah i think you should think about it that the brass foundry is certainly the largest project of the three and that the 30 million is going to be frankly fairly lumpy with the first piece coming from improvement as a result of the chattanooga large casting foundry being virtually complete by midway through this year and then the balance with kimball and decatur having a much longer fuse and the bulk of the savings coming in the back half as a result of decatur and kimball michael wood nomura instinet analyst got it just finally i wanted to ask on the guidance it seems early in the fiscal year to increase guidance so just wondering if you could shed some more light on maybe the top one or two things that you re seeing that gives you the confidence in the visibility thank you scott hall president and chief executive officer i think that the biggest thing is when you come out of the gate at 10 3 and you do the weighted average math for the rest of the year i feel confident that we should be able to maintain implied organic growth rates in that three and a half four and a half percent range given bookings and the state of the market we also put the language in there that we re cautiously optimistic given some of the global domestic uncertainties and certainly we recognize as we re in the early days of the coronavirus that there could be some supply chain impact and so nodding to what s been a strong order book through the first four or five months but at the same time recognizing there s some risks on the horizon michael wood nomura instinet analyst great thank you operator next question in the queue is from brent thielman from d a davidson your line is now open brent thielman d a davidson analyst thank you hey scott maybe just touching on that last point i mean anything in particular you re looking at related to supply disruptions or risks that you re monitoring i m assuming with no change in the guidance you don t see a lot but just curious where you might see it show up scott hall president and chief executive officer yeah so i think with our facilities in china we have a great handle on what they produce how they produce what s at risk what the time line of the month being in running and that but what i think is uncertainty for all of national association of manufacturers may find in other organizations is how much of your domestic supply chain is dependent on components from foreign supply chain and what does that foreign supply chain s dependence look like especially in the hubei province in china so i think that s the part that we re all scrambling frankly to figure out where we source components are two or three steps back in the supply chain and i think that s where the real risk to manufacturing lies in the next let s call it 12 to 16 weeks brent thielman d a davidson analyst yep ok and then can you just talk about kind of how krausz is integrating or benefiting from the integration into mueller i mean it seems like they ve seen pretty good growth are they seeing faster core growth in their business and sort of benefiting from the synergies and kind of distribution channel you brought to them scott hall president and chief executive officer yes i believe that everything that we identified in our synergies case when we made the acquisition we ve tracked quarter by quarter and i would say that without a question at the aggregate we re very pleased with the acquisition how it s performed where we ve gotten growth the introduction to existing mueller customers and conversely very pleased with exposure to some of the traditional krausz customers of mueller products and in the aggregate i would give it an a the team has done a very good job of integrating the sales team did a very good job of harmonizing programs across our customer base but we still have room for improvement and we re going to continue to measure and manage measure and manage measure and manage all the way through the process until we get to our fully integrated state which i think is another year away brent thielman d a davidson analyst yep ok and then any views or i guess expectations built in related to kind of larger municipal capex projects which some of your larger products and valves are attached to is this going to be a stronger year based on what you can see today scott hall president and chief executive officer so thanks for that and i m happy to get into it i think that in the large valve market you will see far more kind of project based it s not going to be kind of the routine maintenance kind of thing and so there will be some lumpiness in that and the fuse on these things tends to be much longer time lines so jobs that are bidding for a 72 inch valve today are likely not going to be in an installed base for another 12 to 18 months and sometimes even longer and so we expect the large gate valves and the large butterfly valve markets behave very much like the henry pratt business where we have a fairly significant carryforward of backlog with longer fuses on big capital projects and so i think that to call it a meaningful impact in the current fiscal year would be a misnomer and we look at it more in the things we re bidding now 54 60 inch or 72 inch valve being installed in fiscal 21 beyond so i do not anticipate a huge lift this year from large valves brent thielman d a davidson analyst yup ok i appreciate it i ll pass it on thank you scott hall president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question is from deane dray with rbc capital markets your line is now open deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning everyone scott hall president and chief executive officer good morning deane deane dray rbc capital markets analyst hey and just congrats on resolving that tax overhang i know that was annoying and it did take cash to do it but it is resolved so just a moment of appreciation for that thanks scott hall president and chief executive officer thank you deane dray rbc capital markets analyst so scott i was really interested in hearing more regarding when you listed all the different technologies at mueller today that you re developing and between echologics metrology the smart hydrant sentryx so how will you and you say you like to measure and manage what s the deployment of these what s the take rate of these technologies what s the contribution either this year and the ramp in the next couple of years and i know each one of them is different but from our perspective this is where all the growth is going to be the higher growth the higher margins that will come through so maybe in terms of triage the most important ones just expectations of take rates and growth and contribution and maybe we can start there please scott hall president and chief executive officer ok so that s quite a lot so let me speak in general deane and then you can ask follow up questions i think the most mature technologies that we have right now relate to obviously ami being the most mature where there is a fair deal of take by water municipalities that business has transitioned in my three years from about let s call it 70 30 between amr and visual read to 30 ami to now that the business is majority kind of ami dependent software revenue dependent project management dependent and so it s the most mature so when we talk about the meter business we re really talking more about radios collectors hubs being a bigger and bigger portion of sales going forward when you think about the next most mature it would have to be in both pipe condition assessment and our fixed leak detection from the echoshore dx and i think those two things in particular are kind of in their nascent stage of kind of exploding i think people estimate that market to be between 100 million and 200 million today growing over the next bluefield uses 19 to 30 so we ll use that this is something that could be north of 1 5 billion kind of by 2030 and you have to look at pipe condition assessment and that includes the related services of repair of the pipes it doesn t include the other aspects but it s the next most mature and we really expect those two technologies for that business to kind of double every three to five years kind of numbers but we re starting with relatively small numbers and so its impact is not going to be as huge if you will in the near term and then last but not least i would take all of this water quality piece as it relates to smart hydrants pressure flow water quality monitoring as it relates to sampling stations flushing stations and those kinds of things and say it s the least mature but it has the most potential for revolution if you will in what brings smart water needs and i think that there is a view out there by some people that says we will continue to see large utility owned wireless infrastructure being deployed four five 10 years certainly if you look at people s values multiples what prices are being paid you would say that we are going to be in the utility owned deployed wireless network for maybe three or four more generations or iterations of the technology and we believe that 5g and what we understand of its power requirements that that maybe has one or even two generations left and that 5g with its tremendous bandwidth will probably put us in an environment in water with more mesh networks and more kind of backhauling over 5g cellular for multiple devices and that s why we think once people realize the amount of bandwidth that could be available at a smart hydrant hub and the vast number of data points that could be connected to it through a mesh network we could have kind of a step change in potential adoption in a 5g world and so we continue to believe we continue to develop both ami solution with backhaul over ami backhaul over lorawan backhaul over cellular both mesh and unique because we re not in the business of betting on which one will win and so we ve maintained all along we re the open architecture solution where if you invest you will have max flexibility at a future date and that s kind of been our take so now the second part of your question is what does the take rate look like well we have launched customers with sentryx as you know we ve had successful launches in fixed leak detections we have more than 50 pipe condition assessment customers we re well on our way to establishing acoustics and noninvasive pipe condition assessment technologies on a broad basis and so i think now it s really a matter of educating our customers and being obviously economically viable for them to want to adopt these technologies and for that we think we have both the best business case and the most let s call it lowest risk implementation methods to determine the health of the utility so we feel very bullish about it so will that translate into 8 9 10 growth rates in a normal environment i would say yes absolutely and we should be very bullish about it but as i ve said many times to people on the phone we re also in now the tenth year of an economic expansion that gives us pause to say we ll reach over to the sky what the spending look like what the interest rates long run interest rates look like and so we ve tempered that a little bit but we have not given multiyear guidance deane dray rbc capital markets analyst scott i know i asked a pretty complex question but i admire how thoughtfully you clicked through all the different technologies i really appreciate the answer and we do consider this to be the exciting part of the story and i ll stop there thank you scott hall president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question is from bryan blair with oppenheimer your line is now open bryan blair oppenheimer and company analyst good morning everyone nice start to the year scott hall president and chief executive officer good morning thank you bryan blair oppenheimer and company analyst i was hoping we could circle back on the quarterly cadence baked into your guide i know you ve touched on some of this but you had very strong first quarter relatively easy second quarter comp and then it seems like your guide contemplates flat to down operating profitability in the back half so i guess two parts to that one am i correct in what is assumed in your guidance structure and two if that is the case what are the specific points of conservatism that looking into the fiscal third and fourth quarter admittedly more difficult comps but on top of that what drives the conservative stance scott hall president and chief executive officer bryan i m going to give that to martie as you know we don t guide to quarters we guide to the year so i m not sure what the inference is and i ll leave that to the higher mathematical brains in the room martie martie zakas chief financial officer well i think just starting off i think i d understand one piece is certainly in our first quarter is the last quarter that we have krausz as additive on a year over year base so as we move into the second half of our year or sorry the last three quarters of our year krausz will have been in the prior year s results so i think that s certainly a portion of what we saw with the growth rates in first quarter on net sales and i think as you heard with the guidance now toward the upper end of the net sales range that we gave with the baked in addition of krausz this quarter that sort of implies continued organic net sales growth going forward and we would say with that it also implies continued growth from an adjusted ebitda perspective as well without any particular guidance with respect to the quarters other than as you know we re typically going to see stronger growth in the second half of our year due to the seasonality of our business bryan blair oppenheimer and company analyst ok and i appreciate the color there and then i also appreciate the additional detail you ve offered on the large project investments in particular the 30 million in incremental gross profit step up i just wanted to clarify that as we look out to 2023 that is truly incremental as an additive to the more normalized margin progression that you ve spoken to upward of 100 basis points of gross margin improvement each year via your typical productivity initiatives and drop through scott hall president and chief executive officer right so i kind of expected that question because so let me say that it s mostly additive that there s a think of it as a third of it coming from volume and absorption and incremental profit on that think of two thirds of it kind of coming from operational efficiency so the question being asked if i could restate it is you outlined 50 basis points net 100 basis points of productivity a year 50 basis points net after you reinvest in engineering and some of the other things can i use the 50 basis points and 20 ish million of it as the cumulative or is there some overlap and the answer is there is a slight amount of overlap if you think about the math and you think about what s going on with depreciation and you think about the depreciation offset with it then there is by definition incremental productivity that has to take place and but i think for the purposes of modeling i am confident that we can find the noise if you will in other productivity initiatives and other capital projects that we still have baked in in the out years that are not fully available for us to see today because if we could see them we could do them but i trust for my 20 odd years of doing this that there will be cost savings projects that will allow us to say that this is additive so i think you should think about it that way kind of a 50 basis net improvement and then the 30 million bryan blair oppenheimer and company analyst ok excellent and then last one from me on capital deployment your balance sheet is obviously in good shape you do have these large projects under way but still have decent capacity so i assume if something krausz esque came along you could pull the trigger on it in terms of deploying a net capital would you at this stage of krausz integration be able to take on another deal of that size and the complexities that come with it scott hall president and chief executive officer yes i think what i said to everybody when we bought krausz is that we would not do deals 90 to 180 days but we saw how the we re well beyond that now and i feel like the playbook from the team on the integration and where we are with the integration that i m eager to exercise those muscles as an organization again but it s got to be the right deal at the right price and so yes we would nothing to disclose today bryan blair oppenheimer and company analyst got it thanks again scott hall president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question in the queue is from joseph giordano from cowen your line is now open unknown speaker good morning this is actually francisco amador on for joe what s your outlook for profitability for tech for the rest of the year and do you guys have a longer term outlook as well scott hall president and chief executive officer yes so we do not give guidance by segment and i found it to be kind of a trap in the past and so i m not going to get back and do it but i will say that i expect tech to do exactly what it did in the first quarter which is to show operational improvements quarter over quarter through taking necessary actions both on the manufacturing floor and market from a pricing perspective and from a deal point of view to make sure that we continuously improve profitability i am not interested in being the largest meter manufacturer in the world and not making any money i am interested in being profitable and we are going to continue that merge i think since i ve gotten here we ve gone from a 15 ish million loss and we ve been steadily merging that down at the same time we ve steadily merged that down we ve launched the sentryx platform we ve launched mi net 4 we ve launched multiple radios in the lorawan network we ve gotten a lot of really good technology out of the group that we can apply to infrastructures and i think that the team has done a good job showing good progress will it eventually get profitable of course that s why we invest but i think that we re going to have some time left and i would point out again if you ve listened to martie in her section we know we ve got a ways to go in echologics and continued investment there it has to get scale in order to be profitable and then i think the whole of the segment will be good unknown speaker great i appreciate the detailed answer and it s certainly encouraging to see the margins improving there and then when does the impact from price increases last year in infrastructure start to fade out and do you guys have any more price increases planned for the year martie zakas chief financial officer yes so just to give you a reminder this is sort of the last quarter where with a lot of our products we ve got the benefit of two price increases the one that we implemented back in september of 18 as well as the february of 19 so going forward we have announced price increases for a number of our infrastructure products sort of in that february march time frame and so i d say from that piece we re reasonably comparable on a year over year basis but this would be the last where you d see the benefit of a couple of price increases unknown speaker ok great thank you if i could squeeze in just one quick one on the outlook for interest expense noticed it s about 3 million higher than what it was last quarter is this related to the capitalized interest or lower cash interest or what exactly is driving the increase martie zakas chief financial officer i d say largely certainly looking at the quarter for the non cash adjustment for capitalized interest and then i think as well just a small piece which is lower interest income outlook going forward unknown speaker ok excellent thank you for your answers operator next question is from brian lee with goldman sachs your line is now open brian lee goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions good morning scott hall president and chief executive officer good morning brian lee goldman sachs analyst i guess starting with technologies the q1 conference it was obviously a tough start to appreciate the 5 revenue planned year on year but just wondering how should we be thinking about growth in this segment for the next several quarters comps seem to be getting easier here at least until you get to the fourth quarter and then just i guess higher level do you expect technologies to broadly grow in line below or above the 3 to 5 consolidated view scott hall president and chief executive officer yeah so i think in our prepared comments what we said was that metrology you should expect flat performance year over year and as i discussed we re going to transition the business to more of the ferguson kind of distribution model and we ve got a lower backlog as we ve ceased the elephant hunting at lower prices and we ve recognized improved performance we ve recognized improved both from a cost perspective and from an operating perspective so i think that we re going to continue to run the business that way so you should think about the meter business kind of being flat for the year the growth part of technologies ought to be in our fixed leak detection and our pipe condition assessment business that s where we re focusing selling resources that s where we re focusing our marketing resources so people can start to get a broader based acceptance of the echoshore dx product line and you know we ve got good penetration at san jose and connecticut and other big customers marquee customers that are using this technology successfully to find leaks in their network and this will be the years of kind of getting it out into a much broader acceptance arena so that number what that growth should be we re not disclosing any of that for obvious reasons and i think that we ll have relatively slower growth because of the flat meter business which is the bulk of the segment today but won t be in the long run brian lee goldman sachs analyst ok helpful i appreciate the color and then just a second question and i ll pass it on i might have missed this but the ebit conversion margin in the quarter where you get to something like high teens if my math is correct so wondering if that sounds like it s about in the right ballpark and if you have any thoughts on the trend line kind of moving through the rest of the year in the context of your historical targets since 35 plus i know you have a number of different initiatives moving through the year so wondering how we should be thinking about that conversion margin now thank you martie zakas chief financial officer look i think overall as we think about conversion margins you can absolutely find some lumpiness as you look to think about it on a quarterly basis so i d sort of i think you ve got implicit with the guidance we ve given where the conversion margin falls out from that but certainly on a quarterly basis it s there can be lumpiness brian lee goldman sachs analyst all right then thanks operator next question in the queue is from walter liptak with seaport global your line is now open walter liptak seaport global securities llc analyst hi thanks good morning everyone i wanted to ask about krausz you guys didn t call out what the contribution was either in percentage or whatever for the quarter and since this is the last one i think where it s incremental i wonder if we can get the number scott hall president and chief executive officer yeah i think what we said and we ll continue to say is that you should think about it as a consolidated ebitda margins for the business would be about equal but we re not getting into what pieces are trading in as we negotiate pockets of products where we re decidedly not disclosing that so i think walt if you think about it in the context of kind of at par with the consolidated results you d be pretty close walter liptak seaport global securities llc analyst ok all right great and then the capex start up costs you called out i think 0 5 million of incremental costs in the first quarter is this something that continues on or was this lumpy where we got you have extra costs this quarter but then they ramp back down in the second and third quarter martie zakas chief financial officer what i would say we did we called out the roughly 500 000 this quarter for the large casting foundry which includes depreciation and as we said we expect start production by the end of the second quarter and what i would say is start up costs our expected start up costs for the balance of the year are incorporated into the guidance that we have provided walter liptak seaport global securities llc analyst ok yeah i heard that i guess what the question is does the 0 5 million keep ramping like is it another 0 5 million or more in the second quarter and then continuing to ramp through the year martie zakas chief financial officer yeah what we have we called out the dollar amount in the first quarter we do expect more through the balance of the year and that is incorporated in the guidance that we have just provided walter liptak seaport global securities llc analyst ok ok got it and if i could just ask a last one on ferguson and the tech margins is there something structural that changes with the ferguson relationship where you have better visibility to profitability in the tech segment now scott hall president and chief executive officer no i wouldn t say it s better visibility or the lumpiness of the jobs will go away or anything like that i think what it is is that contrary to it is the way we used to do it you go elephant hunting for these multiyear contracts and you look at the average price point on a contract you look at the average price point in the replenishment market and there s a significant spread i m not going to say how much but just it s better business it s better business from a flow perspective and it s better business from a yield perspective and so yes it s knocked out some of the complexity and we would take more but i d be happy to have more distribution business walter liptak seaport global securities llc analyst ok great sounds good thank you scott hall president and chief executive officer thank you operator and the last question in the queue is from jose garza with gabelli your line is now open jose garza gabelli asset management analyst hey good morning guys scott hall president and chief executive officer good morning jose jose garza gabelli asset management analyst hey scott i noticed you guys bought in that pratt jv just i guess talk about if kind of any structural difference that you guys are undertaking now that you guys kind of bought that in small amount scott hall president and chief executive officer go ahead martie martie zakas chief financial officer yeah so let me just start off so this was a joint venture that we entered into in 2014 just to be clear as you think about it from a financial statement perspective since we entered into that joint venture we have always consolidated the results within our operations so as you look at it you won t see anything different from that perspective it was just the small amount of the equity interest that was factored out but we did acquire the balance the non controlling interest that we had of about 51 and it was just a little over 5 million it s a small business it s part of our pratt brand and gives us capabilities largely in the industrial valve segment of the business and we think it s a good opportunity it s a business that we certainly watch for the last five years and we ll continue to look to grow that business and integrate it as we need to jose garza gabelli asset management analyst so i guess nothing strategic difference scott hall president and chief executive officer well i would say the strategic rationale to take it over was to be in control of both the brand and the product offering we like the industrial space there are certain applications there that we think have long term growth capabilities and that we think we can also bring some technology too that will give us an ability to be successful against the traditional competitors there but are you asking me are we going to go into flow control in the industrial and bump up against the emerson etc no not interested in doing it we have our niche we believe it s got some attractiveness to it that s why we bought it out jose garza gabelli asset management analyst ok fair enough and then you talked quite a bit about the technologies new product introductions i guess if you could talk about on the infrastructure side your new product pipeline kind of going into this in this year and then compare that to where you ve been scott hall president and chief executive officer yeah i think that we ve been working tremendously i m not going to say or announce something here that we plan to announce at ace or something but i think you ve seen at the last couple of aces some new restraints you ve seen some integration of hydrants in the krausz products you ve seen some integration of valves in the krausz products you ve seen some early indications of a new insertion valve there s been many many things that the infrastructure team has been working on that over the past three or four product entry windows we have launched and the pipeline is full for the year that is to say that when we review our product development pipeline and we look at our engineering resource availability we currently sit for the year at a deficit that is we have more projects than we have resources that we go through the prioritization process and come up with what we ll be launching next and if you come to ace you come to weftec hopefully you ll see some things you have not seen before jose garza gabelli asset management analyst you know i m so going to be there thanks very much guys scott hall president and chief executive officer thank you jose martie zakas chief financial officer thanks scott hall

us yield curve inversion and financial market signals of recession prepared by johannes gräb and stephanie titzck published as part of the ecb economic bulletin issue 1 2020 the inversion of the us yield curve in mid 2019 led to heightened concerns about a possible us recession the us yield curve is often seen as a predictor of recessions a flattening or inversion of the yield curve or negative term spread in which interest rates at the long end are below those at the short end has often been understood as a signal of an impending recession in late summer 2019 the us yield curve inverted for the first time since the global financial crisis see chart a global recession analyses may help assess risks to the economic outlook this box presents an assessment of the probability of a recession in the united states taking into account developments that have distorted the signals derived from the current yield curve chart a adjusting the term spread short and long term perspectives percentage points sources federal reserve system haver analytics and ecb calculations notes the term spread is the spread between the three month and ten year us treasury yields the us qe adjusted term spread is the spread adjusted for the effect of federal reserve qe on the ten year yield the total qe adjusted term spread accounts for the effect of federal reserve and eurosystem asset purchases on ten year us treasury yields the total qe and official holdings adjusted spread accounts for the effect of official holdings on the ten year yield in addition to the effect of us and euro area qe the latest observation is for november 2019 standard yield curve based recession probability models ignore factors that can distort the signals derived from the current yield curve yield curve based recession models typically relate the probability of recession to a measure of the term spread i e the difference between three month and ten year us treasury yields however the term spread can be affected by factors that have depressed the term premium in longer term bond yields largely independently of the domestic economic outlook first since the global financial crisis us long term yields have been compressed by asset purchases by the federal reserve system although the federal reserve ceased purchases some time ago and until the summer of 2019 was in the process of reducing its holdings of bonds the stock of bonds currently held on its balance sheet has continued to depress term premia on longer term bonds second in the last few years us long term yields have been further compressed by the asset purchase programmes of foreign central banks such as the ecb foreign central banks asset purchases affect us yields through the international portfolio rebalancing channel of monetary policy third since the early 2000s the accumulation of us treasury holdings by foreign central banks has also compressed longer term treasury yields as demand from foreign central banks is typically price inelastic long term yield compression is likely to occur independently of recession risks in the us economy as a consequence the signals from standard recession probability models based on the yield curve may be distorted this box presents alternative recession probability models to deal with these possible distortions to the signals from the yield curve specifically term spread measures are constructed to adjust for the effects of asset purchase programmes and foreign central bank reserve accumulation these measures are then included in a standard logit regression model to assess the probability that a us recession will occur over a one year horizon a logit model is used to estimate the probability of a binary event in this case the us economy being in recession based on a number of explanatory variables the following term spread variants are used to estimate the probability of recession first a term spread measure that corrects the us ten year yield for the effect of the federal reserve s quantitative easing qe programmes is constructed to do so the impact of the three large scale asset purchase lsap programmes the maturity extension programme and reinvestments on the us term premium for ten year government bond yields is assessed adjusting the ten year yield for the effects of qe leads to a markedly larger difference between the three month and ten year us treasury yield i e a wider term spread in particular between 2012 and 2018 see chart a yellow line the adjusted term spread increases with the gradual expansion of the federal reserve balance sheet and peaks at 124 basis points in september 2014 just before the end of net asset purchases the difference between the standard term spread and the us qe adjusted term spread narrowed during the federal reserve s balance sheet normalisation between october 2017 and august 2019 but it still remains significant second a term spread measure is derived to account for spillover effects on us yields of asset purchases by eurosystem central banks see chart a red line to do so the correlation coefficient of the day on day change in german bund yields and us treasury yields at ten year maturity following ecb asset purchase programme app announcements is calculated the total effect of the ecb s quantitative easing on us yields is then calculated by applying the correlation coefficient to the estimated effect of the eurosystem s app on the ten year euro area term premium finally the us term spread is corrected for these spillovers from app announcements by adding the estimates to the us ten year yield third a term spread measure that also takes into account the effect of foreign official reserve holdings of us treasury bonds is constructed see chart a green line ecb estimates suggest that an increase in foreign official holdings by 10 percentage points of the outstanding stock of us government debt leads to a 55 basis point fall in the term premium on us treasuries given observations of the amount of foreign official us dollar holdings as a share of total outstanding us government debt it is possible to adjust the ten year yield for these effects the official holdings adjusted term spread starts deviating noticeably from the standard term spread in the early 2000s when china and other emerging market economies started to increasingly accumulate us dollar reserves see chart a since 2008 the term spread accounting for the effect of official holdings has on average been about 165 basis points higher than the qe adjusted term spread a model based on the standard term spread may potentially overstate current recession probabilities compared to models that account for the effect of asset purchases as shown in chart b in august 2019 at the point of the greatest yield curve inversion the predicted one year ahead recession probability based on a model using the standard term spread was 37 in contrast the term spread adjustments proposed here point to markedly lower probabilities the model that uses a term spread adjusted for us qe points to a probability of 28 once the spillover effects of the app on the us term spread is also adjusted for the probability falls to 21 further adjustment for the effects of foreign official holdings on the term spread reduces the probability to just 12 chart b recession probabilities based on term spread variants percentages sources federal reserve system haver analytics and ecb calculations notes shaded areas denote national bureau of economic research nber recessions the term spread variants are explained in the notes to chart a overall models that account for the fact that the term premium in longer term bond yields and thus the term spread can be depressed by factors that are largely independent of the domestic economic outlook suggest a lower probability of a us recession than models based on the standard term spread in august 2019 when model based recession probabilities peaked the correction indicates a 9 to 25 basis points lower probability of a recession one year ahead compared to the standard model the model that accounts for us and euro area qe which is found to be best performing in terms of statistical properties implied a recession probability of 28 since august 2019 recession probabilities have declined across all models in line with a widening term spread driven in particular by an increase in long term government bond yields this suggests a somewhat more benign outlook for the united states than suggested by market commentary in the summer of 2019
the nation is well and truly trapped by the geostrategic manoeuvrings of india china and the usa by ameer ali president gotabaya rajapaksa pgr coined the phrase prosperity with splendour and promulgated it as the chief objective of his presidency it is a tacit acceptance that 72 years of independence had neither brought prosperity nor splendour why did a nation endowed with so much natural resources and human talent which gained its independence on a platter without shedding a drop of blood but with ample foreign reserves inherited a highly efficient civil service and public administration and managed to establish with pride one of the most successful welfare states in asia fail to build on that enviable edifice a modern economic powerhouse like a few of her asian neighbours economists may theorise the causes of this failure ad nauseam but the most fundamental of reasons that prevented such a transformation goes beyond economics and enters deep into the nation s politics it was the metastasis of communal politics that sowed the seeds of national disunity and inter communal discontent which ultimately deprived the economy of the vitally needed synergy emanating from a united citizenry sri lanka s ethno religious and cultural diversity sri lanka s ethno religious and cultural diversity is a blessing in disguise contrary to what present day buddhist supremacists seem to believe the ancient rulers of this nation realised this fact and harnessed that diversity to create prosperity with splendour the difference between now and then is that those monarchs with true commitment to their buddhist faith and its values treated every component of that plurality with equal dignity respect and tolerance although every community had its own social hierarchy and stratification each community in the eyes of the ruler carried the same status the sangha of course advised those rulers when needed to make the realm virtuous and in conformity with buddhist ethos in short and to put it in modern political parlance every subject under those monarchs was an equal citizen the kingdom was a united but plural entity in which every community and every subject lived in peace and contributed to the best of their ability to the success of the realm political and economic rationalism and not religious bigotry ruled the day today s supremacists are deliberately hiding this beautiful chapter of sri lanka s golden history in order to thrust their own twisted version history is prostituted to satisfy the demands of power hungry chauvinists sinhala and tamil ethno nationalism the western concept of nation state and nationalism which were originally devised to unite warring petty kingdoms in medieval christendom later became in the hands of european colonisers a divisive and poisonous instrument to divide and rule several plural societies that remained peaceful and cosmopolitan until the colonialists arrived the disintegration and destruction of the ottoman empire is proof par excellence of the handy work of poisonous nationalism similarly sinhala and tamil ethno nationalism which sapped the economic vitality of this island and dragged it into a foolish and futile civil war were a by product of the same so called westphalian synthesis as an outgrowth of this ethno nationalism is the idea of buddhist supremacy which is now dictating the political and economic agenda of pgr and his caretaker government pgr s strategy of political exclusion with economic inclusion of minorities is a clear expression of supremacist thinking how could he or any government under him achieve prosperity with splendour by empowering one group at the expense of another is beyond any sense of political rationality and economic justice a few days ago it was reported that one of the militant members of the sangha while addressing a gathering in jaffna called on tamil leaders and their people to learn the sinhalese language and join the majority to develop the nation he did not even have the courtesy to say that he was willing to learn the tamil language at least to communicate with tamils and understand their feelings grievances and aspirations it is the same ven thera who also wants to homogenise different marriage laws and traditions in the country in favour of one common law people of his ilk insisted and won prohibiting the national anthem to be sung in tamil at independence day celebrations with this type of racism they are also indirectly advocating that tamil speakers need not espouse patriotic emotions what a dangerous attitude especially at a time when foreign powers are vying to gain a long term foothold in the country a divided nation is an inviting terrain for scheming outsiders similarly on a different occasion a budding muslim leader was calling members of his own community to join the sinhala majority and be part of pgr s race for economic development this native informer should know very well that the supremacists who are behind pgr while not prepared to consider the tamils as co owners of this land are also questioning the indigenousness of muslims in this country in other words to the supremacists members of the two minority communities are virtually non citizens at best or second class citizens at worst how could any leader expect to promote genuine political partnership on such unequal terms such a partnership would eventually lead to a master servant relationship which seems to be the objective behind pgr s authoritarianism with soft militarisation of government s high powered administrative and managerial sectors and with the posting of security personnel in every district apparently to assist in development work a police state seems to be looming on the horizon stop using the heart to do the work of brain a workable solution to the national question and post war reconciliation is possible if supremacists and their opponents stop using the heart to do the work of brain let reason prevail over emotion and consider a solution in the context of the gravity of situation confronting the country today of the manifold issues facing the nation two are critical and they need a united effort from the entire population to tackle successfully one is the economy and the other is national security on the economic front behind the massaged statistics dished out by ministers and their appointees an unbiased review of the real economy depicts a worrying future sky rocketing cost of living amidst ad hoc populist handouts increasing unemployment worsen by underemployment chronic budget deficits caused by wasteful expenses and falling public revenue mounting national debt depreciating rupee and resulting inflationary pressures are problems that cannot be solved without massive increase in domestic output with surplus to export foreign direct investment fdi can certainly be of assistance though not the solution but even fdi will not flow in unless the home ground is attractive and safe to investors that attraction depends on the quality of domestic infrastructure quality of domestic labour and associated factors of production and above all a peaceful political and social environment the last of these is rarely stressed by theoretical economists but assumed away at best under the all inclusive ceteris paribus in sri lanka especially peace and security is precondition to achieve prosperity with splendour modern economies are not built on science and technology alone although they are crucial but with the co operative effort of the people who contribute to and benefit from those economies that co operation cannot be bought or forced it has to be spontaneous and that spontaneity depends on how free independent and happy people feel about the socio political surrounding in which they live this is why popular democracy is such an attractive political model especially for plural societies it provides opportunities for a numerical minority to become a political majority and vice versa depending on the policies they advocate and programs they represent having denuded democracy of its inner substance while preserving it carapace of political parties and periodic elections ethno nationalism in this country has destroyed socio political peace which in turn has thwarted prosperity with splendour political exclusion and economic inclusion will not work that peace cannot be recovered by relying on security forces alone increasing the size of police army air and naval personnel that are imbued with supremacist thoughts equipping them with expensive and state of the art weapons and allowing them to roam around in every city town and village may succeed in injecting fear and anxiety among masses but will not promote societal peace and the necessary confidence in the future especially among communities that had been grievously hurt by past injustices at the hands of these forces without peace and confidence economic efforts will remain suboptimal at best this is why pgr s strategy of political exclusion and economic inclusion will not work once again it should be stressed that our policy makers study closely how pluralist singapore built its singaporean identity that turned that resource poor tiny island into a regional economic giant in a public address delivered by lee kwan yew in the mid 1980s he warned the chinese chauvinists in his country not to commit the error of sri lanka by advocating ethno nationalism it was the same lee who envied the development of this island when he visited in early 1950s with reference to security pgr and his caretaker government need not be reminded of the fact that the art of warfare has changed dramatically in recent years we are living in an age of drone attacks and cyber terrorism to protect an island like ours against such misfortunes requires international cooperation that cooperation has now become a complex matter because of geopolitical developments in the indian ocean to trumpet that sri lanka adopts a neutral foreign policy is simply for public consumption bereft of substance because of the strategic developments in the indian ocean there is always a possibility that sri lanka may become a new theatre of war in asia and that war will not be fought with conventional weapons the nation is well and truly trapped by the geostrategic manoeuvrings of india china and the usa how our own civil war itself contributed to this tragic situation is a sordid chapter altogether which the supremacists may not want to read about or listen to given this scenario at least a united sri lanka can help to minimise possible damages the old adage united we stand and divided we fall is no more appropriate than it is now this is why it is time that pgr and his supremacists from the political economic and religious circles address the national question without delay and with open mind what the country needs is unity with equality among its plural constituents with that unity prosperity with splendour is certainly within our reach the writer is attached to the school of business and governance murdoch university western

similar measures presented by other entities refer to the section entitled non gaap measures contained within arc s md a 3 trading prices are stated in canadian dollars on a per share basis and are based on intra day trading on the toronto stock exchange commodity price environment crude oil and condensate geopolitical tensions and uncertainty around global demand growth continued to impact global crude oil prices during the three months ended december 31 2019 while significant intra day volatility was observed during the period prices did not break out of their recent banded range despite opec and non opec members collectively agreeing to deepen existing production cuts and decelerated production growth observed in us supply prices are expected to remain range bound in the near term in canada crude oil differentials remained relatively narrow in the period as the alberta government eased its mandated production curtailments and introduced special production allowances for crude by rail exports arc s physical oil production has not been impacted by the mandated production curtailments while its corporate crude oil and condensate realizations have benefited from the narrower price differentials natural gas us natural gas benchmark prices increased slightly during the three months ended december 31 2019 however remain under pressure with continued production growth and lower demand due to warmer than average weather meanwhile western canadian natural gas prices strengthened and differentials tightened considerably in the period recent cold weather along with natural gas storage entering withdrawal season at multi year lows has provided a constructive backdrop for canadian winter natural gas prices changes to tc energy s nova gas transmission limited ngtl system s flow priorities have also improved the outlook for western canadian natural gas prices for the summer of 2020 and are expected to reduce pricing volatility through future periods of maintenance arc maintains a strategy to physically and financially diversify its realized natural gas price to multiple downstream sales points with the objective of mitigating the impact that single hub pricing volatility could have on the company s commodity sales revenue and protecting itself from being solely exposed to local markets arc expects that its diversification activities may be less economic in times when local spot prices are strong relative to other north american markets financial review balance sheet and capital allocation during the year ended december 31 2019 arc generated funds from operations of 697 4 million funding the company s dividend obligations of 212 4 million and sustaining capital 1 requirements of approximately 400 million the remainder of arc s 2019 capital program which included significant infrastructure investments for key development projects at dawson and ante creek was funded with excess funds from operations and cash arc maintains financial flexibility through its strong balance sheet targeting its net debt to be between 1 0 and 1 5 times funds from operations at december 31 2019 arc had 940 2 million of net debt outstanding a reduction from the net debt balance at september 30 2019 the net debt to funds from operations ratio was 1 3 times at december 31 2019 and arc had an additional 1 2 billion of credit capacity available with lower facility and infrastructure investments planned for 2020 compared to the last several years funds from operations generated in 2020 are expected to fund arc s dividend obligations

loss of 0 03 per share during the three months ended december 31 2019 compared to a net loss of 57 2 million loss of 0 16 per share during the three months ended september 30 2019 an increase in commodity sales due to higher production and stronger price realizations was partially offset by increased unrealized losses on arc s risk management contracts and increased general and administrative

the year ended december 31 2019 compared to net income of 213 8 million 0 60 per share for the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease in earnings is primarily attributed to an increased unrealized loss on arc s risk management contracts a decrease in commodity sales from production due to lower crude oil production and lower price realizations and a lower gain recorded on the disposal of non core assets in 2019 compared to 2018 partially offsetting these items were increased income tax recovery and an increased gain on foreign exchange related to the revaluation of arc s us dollar

31 per share for the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease in funds from operations was largely driven by lower commodity sales due to weaker price realizations and decreased crude oil production

result of higher royalty rates associated with higher realized commodity prices operating and transportation expense per boe decreased reflecting new natural gas production at the sunrise phase ii facility which has lower relative costs to operate and transport for the year ended december 31 2019 relative to the year ended december 31 2018 arc s netback and netback including realized gain on risk management contracts decreased due to lower realized commodity prices and a reduced realized gain on risk management contracts and were partially offset by a year over year decrease in arc s royalties and operating expense royalties decreased due to the sliding scale effect that lower realized commodity prices have on royalty rates in combination with a year over year increase in condensate and natural gas production which have generally been subject to lower relative royalty rates compared to crude oil production operating expense decreased as arc brought on new natural gas production at the sunrise phase ii facility which has lower relative costs to operate and disposed of non core production throughout 2018 and 2019 which had higher relative costs to operate transportation expense increased due to higher trucking charges and pipeline tariffs associated with increased condensate and natural gas production operational review arc s position in the montney resource play is made up of approximately 1 000 net sections of land approximately 638 000 net acres with production from these assets representing greater than 90 per cent of total corporate production nearly all of arc s production is processed through owned and operated infrastructure this affords arc greater control over its cost structure and liquids recoveries supports strong safety and environmental performance and gives arc the ability to manage a flexible pace of development arc is a leader in sustainability practices and is committed to continue reducing its ghg emissions intensity and freshwater usage through responsible development activities arc has set a target to reduce its ghg emissions intensity by 25 per cent by 2021 relative to 2017 levels and has made significant progress to date in meeting this target capital expenditures in 2019 arc continued to focus on its core montney businesses through strong capital execution and excellent safety performance arc invested 691 5 million of capital in the year and with its consistent approach to asset development delivered record annual production low 2p f d costs and the company s lowest operating expense in 20 years approximately 95 per cent of 2019 capital investment was directed at arc s highly efficient montney assets notably arc advanced the dawson phase iv gas processing and liquids handling

sedar com definitions of oil and gas reserves reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations as of a given date based on the analysis of drilling geological geophysical and engineering data the use of established technology and specified economic conditions which are generally accepted as being reasonable reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates as follows proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves information regarding disclosure on oil and gas reserves and operational information all amounts in this news release are stated in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified where applicable natural gas has been converted to boe based on a six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil ratio the boe rate is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different than the energy equivalency of the 6 1 conversion ratio utilizing the 6 1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value use of boe in isolation may be misleading in accordance with canadian practice production volumes and revenues are reported on a company gross basis before deduction of crown and other royalties and without including any royalty interest unless otherwise stated unless otherwise specified all reserves volumes in this news release and all information derived therefrom are based on company gross reserves using forecast prices and costs this news release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry each of these metrics is determined by arc as set out below these metrics are reserve replacement reserve life index and finding and development costs these metrics do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities as such they should not be used to make comparisons management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare arc s performance over time however such measures are not reliable indicators of arc s future performance and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual 2p reserve additions in boe by arc s annual production in boe management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserves base over a period of time reserve life index or rli is calculated by dividing the reserves in boe in the referenced category by the midpoint of the production guidance in boe for the following year management uses this measure to determine how long the booked reserves will last at current production rates if no further reserves were added finding and development costs or f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category in boe f d costs including fdc includes all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production f d costs take into account reserves revisions and capital revisions during the year the aggregate of the costs incurred in the financial year and changes during that year in estimated fdc may not reflect total f d costs related to reserves additions for that year management uses f d costs as a measure of its ability to execute its capital programs and success in doing so and of its asset quality arc s oil and gas reserves

totaling 40 million globally on an annualized basis 12 million net to bep invested 2 billion 550 million net to bep of equity in nine transactions including doubling the size of our asian and distributed generation businesses adding a leading global solar developer and investing in a hydro portfolio in canada commissioned 50 megawatts of new capacity progressed approximately 2 100 megawatts through construction and advanced stage permitting and increased the size of our development pipeline to approximately 13 000 megawatts maintained our robust investment grade balance sheet ended the year with 2 7 billion of available liquidity and raised approximately 1 4 billion in incremental liquidity through asset sales and strategic upfinancings and announced the creation of a canadian corporation bepc that will provide investors the optionality to invest in bep through either the current partnership or through a corporation which is expected to support the expansion of our investor base update on growth initiatives during the fourth quarter we closed our acquisition of a 50 interest in x elio a leading global solar developer with this acquisition we have significantly enhanced our solar development capabilities adding 972 megawatts of operating assets and almost 6 000 megawatts to our global construction and development pipeline also in the fourth quarter we signed two agreements to acquire 14 solar development projects in brazil with 428 mw of total capacity for total consideration of 120 million 30 million net to bep both these transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and represent attractive additions to our business in brazil with approximately 2 100 mw of capacity across multiple technologies hydro wind and solar furthermore through our interest in terraform power we acquired 44 mw of pv solar assets in spain for 70 million and signed an agreement to acquire 100 mw of solar csp assets in spain located proximate to terraform power s csp plants for 115 million which terraform power expects to close in the first quarter of 2020 operations in 2019 we generated ffo of 761 million a 13 increase over the prior year as the business benefitted from recent acquisitions strong operational performance and execution on margin enhancement initiatives during the year our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of 720 million representing a 7 increase over the prior year our storage segment also performed well generating 27 million of ffo in the year as our portfolio continues to provide critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and backup capacity to increasingly intermittent grids during the year our generation was roughly in line with the long term average as we continue to benefit from the diversity of our fleet our priority over the past decade has been to diversify the business which over the long term mitigates exposure to resource volatility regional or market disruptions and potential credit events we also continued to execute on key contracting initiatives across all our businesses our focus in latin america continues to be on extending the average duration of our power purchase agreements which today stands at 10 years in brazil and 3 years in colombia as well as signing contracts with high quality credit worthy counterparties globally we continue to see increasing value ascribed to the unique scale renewable storage capabilities that hydroelectric assets provide to increasingly intermittent electricity grids for example in colombia we secured 3 million of ancillary services revenues in the united states we qualified to receive the highest tier renewable energy credits for a number of our hydroelectric assets in the northeast which will contribute 3 million to ffo annually and in the u k our first hydro portfolio was the critical link to restarting the grid following a nation wide blackout in august our wind and solar segments generated a combined 274 million of ffo representing an 18 increase over the prior year these portfolios benefitted from contributions from recent growth initiatives including the acquisition of two wind portfolios in asia and through our interest in terraform power a large distributed generation portfolio in the united states and full year contributions from saeta yield a scale european wind and solar portfolio we also benefitted from executing on opportunistic o m outsourcing agreements aimed at de risking the portfolios owned by terraform power and where appropriate delivering cost savings we executed on three such agreements across terraform power and our wind portfolio in brazil a common theme across all these opportunities was attractive availability guarantees and a more comprehensive scope than what was currently in place at terraform power these initiatives will deliver aggregate cost savings of approximately 30 million 9 million net to bep finally we continued to advance our global greenfield development activities including progressing 717 megawatts of construction diversified across distributed and utility scale solar wind storage and hydro in 7 different countries we are also progressing 1 380 megawatts of advanced stage projects through final permitting and contracting and our total greenfield development pipeline now totals approximately 13 000 megawatts of note during the year we signed power purchase agreements for three wind repowering projects in new york and california totaling 220 megawatts and these projects are expected to be commissioned in 2021 environmental social and governance esg reporting we have been owner operators of long duration critical electricity assets for over a century and therefore understand that embedding strong esg practices into our investing and operating activities is essential to preserving capital mitigating risk and creating long term value fundamentally strong esg practices drive further economic value to our business and inherently create higher barriers to entry as such we integrate relevant esg considerations into our investing and operating strategies we are therefore proud to announce that we are publishing our inaugural esg report which among other things illustrates the on the ground work we do to maintain our social license to operate with one of the largest public pure play renewable portfolios globally we are helping to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids additionally maintaining socially responsible practices from health and safety to community relations to biodiversity is a critical component of successful operations over the long term we operate with the highest ethical standards conducting our business with integrity and above compliance with laws and regulations we aim for best practice everywhere we operate esg and sustainability investing continues to gain momentum globally with esg funds expected to rise into the trillions over the next decade we believe our portfolio s inherent environmental attributes coupled with our long standing practices around maintaining a social license to operate provide significant tailwinds to demand growth for brookfield renewable balance sheet and liquidity our liquidity position remains robust with 2 7 billion of total available liquidity at year end during the year we executed on key financing and capital raising initiatives aimed at maintaining robust access to capital a prudent debt maturity ladder and a low risk investment grade balance sheet during the year we executed on more than 6 billion of financings across the business which allowed us to raise 1 billion of incremental liquidity to bep extend our average debt portfolio duration to 10 years and reduce annual interest costs by 15 million 9 million net to bep of note we continue to advance our green financing strategy in order to capitalize on growing demand for carbon free debt products and diversify our debt investor base to date we have issued six green bonds at both the corporate and project levels which all together totaled approximately 2 4 billion during the fourth quarter we also closed our first incentive linked loan as part of our corporate credit facility that will allow us to reduce our cost of borrowing as we continue to accelerate the decarbonization of global electricity grids as demand for sustainability focused investing continues to grow we expect green financings and sustainability linked loans will increasingly become a more prominent funding lever within our business in 2019 we also continued to execute our capital recycling strategy of selling mature de risked or non core assets to lower cost of capital buyers and redeploying the proceeds into higher yielding opportunities during the year we raised almost 600 million 365 million net to bep through this funding strategy allowing us to crystallize an approximate 18 return on our portuguese and northern ireland wind assets and to return more than two times our capital invested in south africa distribution currency option the quarterly distributions payable on brookfield renewable s lp units are declared in u s dollars unitholders resident in

now that the presidential primaries are finally underway which means that rather than taking up 90 percent of your daily news coverage the election will now take up 100 percent there s a question i think is worth asking but let me say this you probably won t think this question is worth asking you ll probably think this question is dumber than dumb a waste of neurons it s a question we first asked in freakonomics land back when george w bush was president then again during the obama era and here we are now in the age of trump with a president who s just been impeached no less and yet the question we want to ask today is this how much does the president of the united states really matter i fully recognize this may not sound like a sensible question that the answer is too obvious so why do i think it s worth asking because we humans aren t always so good at understanding cause and effect intellectually you know this we talk all the time on this show about how the relationship between x and y isn t always what it seems that other less obvious factors may be important but emotionally that s a different story emotionally we tend to be drawn to clean simple explanations of cause and effect even if the reality is more nuanced this may be a form of mythical reductionism we love our heroes and our villains so if you happen to hate a particular president and i ask you how much does the president matter you ll probably say the president matters very much because it s tempting to blame every bad thing you see on this person who seemingly has infinite power and what if you happen to love a particular president you may well give the same answer they matter very much you say because you ll attribute all good things all signs of progress to your president even if he or she had demonstrably zero to do with a given piece of progress that said has there ever been a less opportune time to ask the question we re asking today maybe not donald trump is the most anomalous and divisive u s president in recent history maybe our entire history but then again maybe it s the perfect time to revisit this question americans are obsessed with the presidency we may ridicule the british obsession with their monarchy but is the attention we pay to the president positive and negative attention is it really so different consider this odd fact the gallup poll every year asks americans to name the man they most admire living anywhere in the world last year the result was a tie between donald trump and barack obama whether you love or hate a given president the white house captures so much of our attention that it seems worth asking how much is signal and how much is just noise how much smoke how much fire is the so called leader of the free world as almighty as we tend to think today on freakonomics radio we put this question to three people in a good position to answer it a law professor who studies presidential power a law professor who studies constitutionalism and a former white house chief economist we talk about the relative power of the government s three branches we talk about the evolution of the presidency and yes we talk about donald trump glenn hubbard well i think president trump can rightly claim some credit eric posner no i do think he s unfit bernadette meyler i think it s a lot easier for a president to destroy than to create let s start with the president s role in the economy and for that we turn to glenn hubbard hubbard i m a professor of finance and economics at columbia university hubbard has twice served in government in the early 1990s as deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis in the treasury and then hubbard and then in the early 2000s i was chairman of the white house council of economic advisors and the principal economic advisor to the president that was republican president george w bush later on hubbard was chief economic adviser to mitt romney on his unsuccessful 2012 presidential campaign hubbard yes i was and also for jeb bush in 2016 dubner so the question we re asking in this episode is somewhat vague intentionally or at least open to interpretation the question is how much does the president of the united states matter hubbard well i think the president of the united states matters less and more than people think less meaning a low number on a scale of one to 10 because the overall economy is moved by very big factors in technology in globalization in developments in consumer tastes and so on but a president has more influence than people think in the sense of the very large regulatory and administrative state which report to the president dubner so most economic measures in the u s at the moment are strong very strong especially the stock markets labor markets are relatively strong with slightly higher wage growth and we re about to enter the meat of a new presidential campaign with obviously trump as the incumbent how much credit not will but should trump claim for this state of the economy hubbard well i think president trump can rightly claim some credit when the beginning of his presidency happened there was a shift in business people s expectations about what was possible there was a sense in which regulation and tax policy were going to become more favorable having said that a lot of factors underlying economic growth happen whoever the president is dubner in terms of trump administration economic policy everything ranging from the 2017 tax cuts to tariff and trade activity with china and elsewhere i d like you to name three things from the trump administration that you approve of and three you disapprove of hubbard in terms of approving right at the very beginning resetting expectations with businesspeople that things were going to be different the pop in the stock market and growth happened at that time it was a different economic climate have to give the president credit for that the tax cut and jobs act had many positive features now it s true that those weren t necessarily the president s own ideas but without presidential leadership you don t get a tax bill and then finally confronting china at the 30 000 foot level i agree with the president where i disagree and this would get to the second set you mentioned on exactly how he confronted china i think there the trade policy has generated significant policy uncertainty i also disagree with the administration s views on immigration i think immigration is a big positive for the american economy and the third criticism is more the dog that didn t bark president trump was elected by a group of people at the margin who felt left behind in the american economy there s so much we need to be doing for these people and i don t see any action from the administration dubner you mentioned the uncertainty over the tariffs and trade war i guess really the big question is will the short term pain and cost of the tariffs be worth it in the long run hubbard well i think that is the real question and that s why i actually start by giving the president some credit previous administrations democrat or republican had not really confronted china as the elephant in the room china really is the bad actor on the international economic stage that the president says it is it is stealing intellectual property it is not abiding by the rules of the world trade organization that said the question is how do you deal with that kind of elephant in the room i would have thought that one way to deal with it would be to get all of our allies together the european union japan canada others with us to confront china fundamentally does it belong in the w t o the world trade organization so i think tariffs were not the right tool dubner what you re describing is not the trump way plainly correct hubbard well perhaps but it would be a typical way to win a negotiation you try to unite your friends and divide your enemies not the other way around dubner why had so many past presidents been reluctant or even impotent to deal with china in this way hubbard i think dealing with china is hard first of all there s a lot of good there the opening up of china to the modern world has been the world s greatest anti poverty program tens of millions of chinese citizens have become less poor as a result of that openness that is a good thing and we shouldn t forget it we also shouldn t forget that many american consumers have benefited a lot from trade with china the question is strategically for the country going forward with a lack of adherence to the w t o rules and the theft of intellectual property serious enough issues i think they became more serious and that s why i give president trump some credit in confronting them dubner so in a columbia business school podcast where you were discussing business leadership you were asked where stability ranks as a leadership trait and you said a leader s first and foremost characteristic is defining and illustrating the organization s purpose but he or she has to be a steady hand in doing that remember people look up to the leader as a symbol of the organization the job of a leader is not to run around with his or her head cut off based on that assessment of yours how would you rate president trump as a leader of his branch of government hubbard well i think president trump s leadership style is different from many leaders i think in some respects he s done a good job he has articulated some very clear themes and tried to approach them on the other hand the vacillation in policy and the policy uncertainty is unsettling just like it would be for employees in a company so i think as with many people there s some strong leadership traits to be sure but others that at least i wouldn t share dubner in that same interview you said this about politics my fear is at what point do people lose faith in the government that they have and that is something one shouldn t trifle with because once lost it s very hard to get back glenn where do you think the u s stands now in terms of its citizenry s faith in its federal government hubbard i think the u s public or at least swaths of it are losing faith in the federal government s ability to solve economic and overall domestic and foreign policy problems and i think that s a problem another manifestation of that problem is that the economic system we have that has delivered amazing innovation changes in living standards not only here but around the world that economic system is not manna from heaven it s in part a political and social construct if people start to lose faith in the system and in the government that provides guardrails around it that becomes a first order problem that is my number one concern at the moment it was nearly 10 years ago that we last asked this question about how much the president matters barack obama was nearly two years into his first term he d had some victories a stimulus package and health care reform but in the 2010 midterm elections the democrats got slaughtered and lost the house one of the people we spoke with for that episode was a cornell law professor named bernadette meyler she specializes in the constitution and executive power that conversation started like this dubner it s a cliché but the president of the united states is regularly called the most powerful person on earth what say you yes no maybe so meyler no basically the president of the united states is not the most powerful person the president s power is really constrained in a lot of different ways and the president isn t as significant as we imagine him or her to be meyler has since moved on to stanford we got hold of her there and asked whether she still agreed with her 10 years ago self meyler i think that my view has shifted somewhat since we spoke i think two things have changed significantly one is that the increases in legislative gridlock have made it even harder to enact a legislative agenda so presidents have moved towards doing more things through executive orders and sole executive action secondly the fact that the filibuster for judicial nominees and for executive branch nominees was abandoned which now means that only a bare majority is required for confirmation in those positions has changed the nature of presidential power regarding appointments and significantly increased that power dubner on that note presidential appointments have the presidents and their administrations been actively trying to glean more power or has that power been transferred or surrendered through some other consequences meyler i think it s a combination of the two in terms of the confirmation process that was up to the senate to determine and ultimately they decided to get rid of the filibuster in that context i think that was a mistake on the part of the senate but that was a legislative action a quick primer here while the president has the power to nominate federal judges they must be confirmed by the senate that used to require a supermajority at least 60 of the 100 votes in the senate but in 2013 that changed barack obama s judicial nominees were facing republican pushback the democrats had control of the senate but not enough to muster a supermajority so democratic senate majority leader harry reid used what had come to be known as the nuclear option harry reid it s time to change the senate before this institution becomes obsolete the nuclear option got rid of the rule requiring a supermajority now only a simple majority would be required to confirm all federal judicial nominees except for the supreme court mitch mcconnell who was then the senate minority leader here s what he said at the time mitch mcconnell i say to my friends on the other side of the aisle you will regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think indeed in the next election cycle the republicans took control of the senate and then in 2016 when the republican donald trump was elected president he had the power to confirm judges with a simple majority and he has been using that power just three years into his first term trump has gotten confirmed 50 appeals court judges obama only got 55 during his entire two terms one of every four sitting circuit court judges is a trump appointee and then there s the supreme court in 2017 mitch mcconnell got rid of the supermajority requirement for that and that s helped make possible the confirmation of two trump nominees to the supreme court neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh and so as bernadette meyler argues presidential power has certainly increased when it comes to judiciary appointments but she says that s not the only avenue through which presidential power has been consolidated lately meyler obama i think did aggrandize executive power to some extent he wound up making a lot of determinations through his executive cabinet and other executive branch processes during his two terms barack obama issued 276 executive orders there is nothing extraordinary about that number george bush issued 291 bill clinton 254 president trump has so far issued 138 keeping him roughly on or perhaps a bit ahead of that pace but there is a great variance in the reach of a given executive order it can be something as simple as a statement of intention or some sort of ceremonial proclamation or it can essentially create policy without having to bother going through the legislative branch obama frustrated with a republican majority in congress that he saw as needlessly obstinate he often chose the latter barack obama we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we re providing americans the kind of help they need i ve got a pen and i ve got a phone obama s appetite for executive action was fairly omnivorous meyler with respect to climate change he made a lot of executive orders and he also entered the paris agreement as president rather than trying to negotiate a treaty which would probably have been impossible he also extended the deferred action for childhood arrivals program which was a decision by the executive branch not to enforce some of the immigration laws against people who had come to the country as children so i think that obama did aggregate more power into the executive branch which then also meant that a lot of his actions could be undone subsequently by president trump dubner so barack obama is nothing if not a thoughtful and intelligent human so it s impossible for me to reckon that he wouldn t have thought through the consequences of aggregating that power through the use of executive orders and sole executive action and so on so what do you think was the plan there or the idea meyler yeah i think that s a fascinating question and it s something that i have thought a bit about one thing that he said with respect to the affordable care act is that it established a baseline and i think his view was that you couldn t go back from that baseline i think that was the motivation behind presenting something like daca or entering into the paris agreement i think his view was that these baselines would be very hard to dial back it hasn t really proved as hard as i think he imagined i definitely think it has increased the extent to which trump could claim some form of bipartisan legitimacy for his action that he can claim that he s just acting as a democratic president would and i think that s particularly the case with something like daca where he can say well i don t think it was constitutional in the first place so i m going to get rid of it and i m not exercising extra discretion it s just what obama had done previously another example that occurs to me is the national monuments so he reduced the national monuments in utah more than any president has reduced national monuments previously and his claim was well it was just some democratic presidents clinton and obama who created these large monuments and prevented people in utah from using their land in the way that they would have liked to so i m just undoing the wrong that these earlier presidents did dubner i d like you to compare president trump s declarations of intent whether they were things he said during the campaign or during his time in office with his actual accomplishments meyler i think he s generally tried to do the things that he claimed he would do he s definitely made immigration a big hinge of his presidency as he had said he would i think he s lived up to promises to the coal plants and various other energy industry constituencies to dial back environmental regulation and then also on the tax front he managed to undermine the affordable care act through the law that was passed to get rid of basically the tax that would have supported the affordable care act dubner and how typical would you say that is for recent presidents again the gap between declarations of intent and accomplishments meyler i would say he s been average i don t feel that he s been extraordinarily effective he had touted passing a lot of laws early in his presidency but the pew foundation did a study and showed that while the number of laws were say greater than the prior congress a lot of those laws were symbolic and there weren t that many major legislative accomplishments dubner it strikes me that trump kind of has put the bully back in the bully pulpit that he s behaving demonstratively in ways that past presidents haven t in a long time and i m curious your views on that meyler yes i love this metaphor of the bully pulpit as applied to trump i would not have thought of that but i yes i completely agree he has put the bully back in bully pulpit my feeling is that there could be a positive dimension to reinvigorating the symbolic and the rhetorical power of the presidency now i mean i really dislike everything that trump does and all of his tweets and excess but the way that he s managed to actually use social media to galvanize people and to try to unify his base around an agenda i think is instructive for other potential leaders i think one problem with president obama s strategy was that he didn t really appeal enough to people and to people s ordinary moral intuitions in order to get them to support his agenda i think people felt that his presidency was too bureaucratic or too technocratic so that he wasn t really taking advantage of the possibility of galvanizing a public just for the historical record i want to clarify something here it was president teddy roosevelt who coined the phrase bully pulpit as a description of the presidency and roosevelt took great delight in using the bully pulpit but back then the word bully had an additional usage as an adjective that meant good or even great that s what roosevelt meant by calling the presidency a bully pulpit that it was a great platform to get things done not that you could use the presidency to bully people into submission okay okay dubner if you could just in a nutshell tell us the president has the greatest leverage in which realms and the weakest or least leverage in which realms meyler i would say the president has the greatest leverage when you re dealing with foreign affairs so that s one reason why he could get out of the paris agreement that he s negotiating in various ways with other countries with china about tariffs another area is in the administrative state and there it s not only by direct command but also by retaining the power to fire people and the supreme court has gradually been making the president s power over subordinates in the administrative branch more plenary and saying that it s not constitutional to restrict in various ways and then another prominent area in the trump administration would be the power of pardoning which he s been using to great strategic advantage dubner can the president constitutionally pardon him or herself if required meyler i don t think so i think that goes back to a limitation implicit in the concept of pardoning itself which has to do with the common law precept that you can t be a judge in your own case dubner okay and then some realms in which the president is maybe weaker than the average person might think meyler so one really important realm is with respect to budgeting congress really is acknowledged to have the power of the purse and that does constrain what the executive branch can do one example i think where trump really attempted to make a strong push for greater executive power is with respect to the national emergencies act when congress refused to grant him the money to build his border wall he decided to appropriate the money from the defense budget and transfer that money under a claim of authority through the national emergencies act even though congress had pretty explicitly said that they didn t want to give him money for that project dubner so one hallmark of the trump presidency has been deregulation and he argued that one hallmark of the obama administration was heavy regulation so can you talk for a moment about the degree of power or leverage in the realm of regulation for presidents again whether through executive order or legislation or just not enforcing existing regulations meyler so i think it s a lot easier for a president to destroy than to create and to undo prior actions than to pass a new agenda proactively i think that trump has benefited a lot from not enforcing things the example that comes to mind for me is the affordable care act where it took obama so much political energy and will to pass the affordable care act and that was the main i would say regulatory reform of his administration whereas it doesn t take that much to not enforce a lot of its provisions dubner so of the three branches of government which would you argue has gained the most power and lost the most power over the past let s say two decades meyler i think that the judiciary has gained the most power dubner really meyler because with the impasse in the legislative branch almost all questions of significance are getting decided by the judiciary and it means that congress lacks the ability to really override judicial decisions because they just can t agree on enough so for example with a lot of these administrative questions previously congress might have been able to say clarify the meaning of a statute that an administrative agency is implementing by passing some kind of further legislation but now they re not really able to do that so most of these questions wind up getting resolved ultimately by the supreme court dubner now i know that you personally clerked some time back i believe it was for judge robert katzman the u s court of appeals 2nd circuit is that right meyler yes dubner so assure me that you are not exercising your personal judiciary bias in claiming that the judiciary has gained the most leverage over the past so you re going to claim that this is an unbiased assessment of the three branches and that judiciary has gained even more the executive yes meyler i think so yes and i mean i actually wish it weren t the case because there was a whole movement in constitutional law to de center courts and actually obama was obviously a constitutional law professor before becoming president and he was i think on board with a lot of the idea about bringing the legislative branch and the executive more into the realm of constitutional interpretation and de centering courts and i think that s why he partly didn t prioritize judicial nominations but my sense is that that just pragmatically was a mistake because in fact the courts have wound up being the branch to decide on a lot of things precisely because the other branches just can t get along well enough if you want to hear some earlier episodes of ours about the political system you might try no 356 america s hidden duopoly or no 255 ten ideas to make politics less rotten dubner so when we last spoke the topic was whether the u s presidency had become or was on its way to becoming a dictatorship or something similar to that i d love you to just quickly summarize your view back then posner my view back then was that we had developed a system of what i prefer to call presidential primacy there are certain elements of dictatorship in it in the sense that the president has primary authority to determine policy in a wide variety of areas and i think this is a system that s evolved over two centuries it s not the system that the founders gave us eric posner is a law professor at the university of chicago he s one of the most cited legal scholars of this era we last spoke with posner back in 2016 for an episode called has the u s presidency become a dictatorship his answer wasn t a hard yes but he was wary of how much power the executive branch had been accruing dubner so would you say that the intensity or level of what you re calling the primacy has increased stayed roughly the same or diminished posner roughly the same dubner now we also should say when we spoke a bit over three years ago we had a good bit of conversation about donald trump but it was all theoretical because it was highly highly unlikely at the time or thought to be highly unlikely that he would be elected so i d just love to hear you for a minute on how surprised you were and how that perhaps changed the way that you thought about this question largely posner i was surprised and how has it changed the way i think about the question well let s separate two dimensions of the question one is what is the system that we have and the other is should we change it i think the system that we have is the same as it was before trump became president and i am more worried now than i was before he became president that the public would elect people who are unfit to be president so in that sense my view has changed to some extent dubner the implication there is that you believe he is unfit to be president or am i overreaching posner no i do think he s unfit dubner so here s my theory is that the president matters much less than most people think chiefly because the president s ability to make substantial changes that directly affect our lives daily lives is in most cases limited or indirect plainly you disagree give me an example or two of where i m wrong posner well i think part of the problem is what does it mean to matter that s just tricky and i agree with you for example that the president can t come in and revolutionize our system can t make the economy grow much faster or cause a recession but where the president matters for example law enforcement priorities whether the police go after drug users or drug dealers immigration policy as we ve seen recently so if you re an american citizen and all of your friends and family and others are americans you might not notice the effect that the president can have on aliens whether they re here lawfully or not but that s a pretty big effect the president can have and then in the area of foreign policy as we ve seen recently the president can really change things very rapidly dubner if i were to ask you to break down the job of president into the major domains how would you label them posner foreign policy is one domain maybe we ll call the economy the other management of the executive branch is maybe a third dimension dubner and then do we want to have another basket that s something like domestic affairs everything non economic posner we could have a basket for that i mean a lot of people put a lot of weight on the president s appointment of judges which is outside of the executive branch dubner so let s go through and let s start with the economy if i were to just ask you in the three plus years that president trump has been in office how much his actions have affected what we call the economy and what specifically he s done let me just ask you to speak on that for a bit posner the corporate tax cut probably provided a short term boost of no real lasting value but that had an effect on people the deregulation that he s engaging in probably won t have a measurable effect on the economy but will affect people s lives in particular he s been dismantling regulations that were designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so the long term effect of that is meaningful and then i think this ridiculous trade war he s started has generated uncertainty and of course has increased costs for imported products dubner would you have predicted that the markets and the economy generally as evidenced by unemployment would be as healthy as they are and if not what s that say about either his leverage or maybe just our inability to predict anything posner i think that s well established in the literature that generally the economy does what it does and presidents will affect it only on the margin in the case of the deregulatory actions that i told you about well very few of them have actually been put into effect they re working their way through the bureaucracy they re being challenged by courts i should also say that the positive effect of deregulation will be on pure economic indicators but there will be non economic harms that aren t going to show up in some kind of aggregate measure like g d p or something like that so if we re going to have more greenhouse gas emissions they re going to show up 10 20 50 years from now when the climate is somewhat hotter than it would be otherwise dubner okay let s talk about foreign affairs then name some signature decisions moves or non moves that president trump has made posner withdrawal from the paris treaty disengagement from security arrangements with foreign countries the beginning of the trade war and cutting back on refugees and other types of immigration dubner and you didn t even get into north korea iran venezuela israel right posner yeah in those cases he is sort of floundering around more it s a little unclear what he s trying to accomplish dubner so the impeachment of president trump has revolved around his withholding of foreign aid to ukraine what can you tell us about the president s unilateral ability to manage foreign aid posner foreign aid is determined by congress but the president has power to withhold it typically the way these things work is if congress wants to do something with respect to foreign relations it will pass a law saying we want x y z to happen but then there will almost always be a provision that says that if the president thinks it s in the national interest not to do this he can do that the constitution is extremely vague about where foreign policy powers are located it gives the president the commander in chief power not clear whether that means only the power to lead the army or whether it s something broader than that so this vagueness was taken advantage of by presidents over the many years that followed and they basically claimed more and more power over foreign policy and congress acquiesced dubner let s move on to as you put it management of the executive branch what falls under the label of management of the executive branch posner appointing members of the executive branch and setting the policy of the executive branch i think this has not really received that much media attention but he s really changed the priorities of the various immigration agencies they re much stricter than they used to be and he s done this through dozens of i guess executive orders or regulatory actions one trump executive order that got a lot of attention and pushback was the so called muslim immigration ban it effectively directed the department of homeland security to refuse entry into the u s of nationals from iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen posner initially the lower courts struck it down because it was sloppy and kind of stupid he revised it the revision included some countries that weren t predominantly muslim north korea and venezuela posner they struck it down again and they were reversed by the supreme court i think most legal scholars were surprised that trump had as much trouble as he did because there is a statute that says that the president can pretty much block anyone from entering into the country for any reason if he believes that it advances national security i next asked eric posner the same question i d asked bernadette meyler about trump and the power of the bully pulpit posner the bully pulpit is extremely important it s the way that the president gets the public behind him and he needs the public behind him to get congress to act if the president really wants to have a significant long term impact there s a limit to what he can do unilaterally but if he has the public behind him he can get congress to pass laws but there s a big difference between the way trump has used the bully pulpit and i think really all previous presidents all previous presidents i m going to hazard they used the bully pulpit to try to unify the country they tried to convince the public that some new policy serves everybody s interests and everybody should support it trump is not like that he uses the bully pulpit to divide people immigration is an important example where he disparages not only undocumented immigrants but also more broadly hispanics muslims from other countries and in a winking way sometimes signals support for white nationalists or white supremacists dubner so as you re speaking it strikes me there maybe needs to be one more basket of presidential activities that we re ranking this president has been aggressive not just in language but in action as have other presidents to be fair but this president has gotten inside the head of a lot of people he s done many things to create anxiety and anger so if we were to consider presidential behavior or carriage another category how much do you think that really matters posner there are all these people who go back and rate presidents and people have even rated how virtuous they are how honest they are and so forth and the worst presidents warren harding for example they re not in trump s league harding was kind of a weakling who didn t try to stop other corrupt people in his cabinet even once he knew about it but he wasn t a dishonest person in his private life he was just pretty much an ordinary politician we ve got someone in the presidency who s a liar dishonest who s he s a philanderer some presidents have been like that but not that many what effect does it have it makes a lot of people angry it sort of contributes to the polarization does it damage the presidency in some long term way maybe i m not sure about that dubner so let s maybe we should call this category virtue do you think it s substantial enough to be separate or not quite posner i think it deserves its own category because it s important to distinguish trump from any old regular republican president so republican presidents come into office they cut taxes they deregulate and in many respects he s no different from that but in this special category what he does in all the other categories is he warps public policy to advance his narrow political interest at the expense of his political opponents in a way that s damaging dubner so here are a couple sentences that you wrote not long ago it is critical to distinguish trump s bark from his bite he has disparaged judges called the media the enemy of the people praised torture and compared the intelligence community to nazis but he has not followed up on these statements you write unlike franklin d roosevelt he hasn t tried to pack the supreme court not that trump needs to you added unlike barack obama you wrote he hasn t yet targeted journalists in leak investigations unlike george w bush you wrote he hasn t actually taken a page from the nazis by ordering the intelligence community to use coercive interrogation so again thinking in terms of leverage or how much the president matters it sounds like you re describing someone that s positioning themselves as an attack dog but is actually a watchdog if not a lapdog posner i wouldn t call trump a lapdog trump s most aggressive behavior i think has been in international relations he s really attacked a bipartisan consensus in favor of free trade american military engagement and in fact the republicans seem to be although muted as unhappy about this as democrats are from just a narrowly constitutional perspective he does seem less aggressive than his predecessors which is not to say at all that he s a better president i think he s far worse than any of his predecessors but in a way this is what my point has been all along which is the presidents we like often are the really powerful ones who break the rules because those rules are out of date and old fashioned and reflect values that we no longer agree with dubner let s say a given person feels that trump is as bad a president as could possibly exist given the norms of american politics even if you believe that and then you look around at how the country is now and probably will be in five and ten years can you really make the argument that the president him or herself matters so much because if one believes this is the worst president ever shouldn t the country have suffered much much more already or perhaps you re arguing it may and we can t tell yet posner well he can be the worst president ever without being infinitely worse than the second worst being a bad president is not the same thing as having an impact so you could say someone s the worst president ever and still think that presidents in general don t have much of an impact i mean we could have a president who is like a declared fascist who still didn t accomplish very much it s just it s hard to say in the abstract what it means to have an impact if you think for example that climate change is the absolutely most essential issue of our time and what trump has done is moved us back several years at a really important time then maybe he will be the worst and most consequential president ever but if you don t think climate change rises to that level of importance then he ll seem like he had less of an impact dubner but there are other variables in that formula for instance climate change it seems is starting to be addressed aggressively and often well by technological solutions and breakthroughs that are the result of millions of people working on thousands of different projects obviously the president could do something about that for good he could also do something about it for ill but again it comes back to me to the leverage of this one person or this one office it s very comforting to think that one person can make things great or terrible it goes back to thomas carlyle s great man theory of history and i think there is a kind of religious connotation there when we assign that much power to one person or one office i think it in some way alleviates some of the pressure or responsibility for ourselves as individuals but i m perfectly satisfied with you not buying that one iota posner no i think people are worried about the president being too powerful and don t take comfort in the idea that one person for example destroyed the entire world by launching a nuclear war so i m not sure i agree with you if the question is how much effect can the national government whether controlled by the president or someone else realistically have on people s lives ah i don t even know how to begin to answer that question i mean it could if it wanted to destroy everybody s life but if we look throughout history sometimes it s had enormous effect and sometimes it s had no effect and i guess i find it hard to assign a number in the abstract but we did ask eric posner and bernadette meyler and glenn hubbard to assign a number on a scale of one to 10 for how much the president matters for each of the major domains we ve been talking about today you ll hear posner first then meyler then hubbard we ll start with the economy posner three meyler i would say seven hubbard i would say one to 10 the president matters six or seven for the economy how about foreign policy posner let s call it seven meyler eight hubbard foreign policy the president matters nine to 10 management of the executive branch posner let s call it six meyler eight hubbard for management of the executive branch i would put the president at five to six it is the president s branch but so much of that management is done by cabinet officers control over the judiciary posner seven meyler eight hubbard eight to 10 if the president is fortunate enough to have a senate that agrees with him or her then that s control how about domestic affairs including the bully pulpit posner nine meyler two or three hubbard i would give that a seven i think economists might generally say not so important but i would say yes important people look to a leader as a gauge of mood of what s going on in the country that would be true in any organization and finally as we agreed to call the final category virtue posner eight meyler i would say nine hubbard i would give it a seven i think virtue matters a lot certainly matters a lot to me personally but i can also think of virtuous presidents that weren t terribly effective dubner for instance hubbard jimmy carter dubner and can you think of people who were a little scoundrel y on the virtue scale that were very effective presidents hubbard i would put richard nixon in that category dubner and where would you put clinton in that category hubbard clinton would definitely be an effective person who had some virtue challenges if you were to assume equal weighting of all the categories a terrible idea if you re trying to come up with a remotely scientific answer which this is not you d find eric posner saying the president matters about six and two thirds on a scale of 1 to 10 bernadette myler a hair above seven and glenn hubbard just shy of seven and a half so fairly consistent rankings from our experts although quite a lot of inconsistency within categories but also that number is fairly well short of a 9 or 10 ranking which is to say that yes the presidency of the united states is an obviously powerful position with more power having accrued perhaps in recent decades but is it possible that maybe just maybe some of us sometimes slightly overemphasize just how much leverage the president has i m going to let you answer that question for yourself once you ve calmed down a bit drop us a line at radio freakonomics com and tell us just how infuriating this episode was but do try to calm down a bit first because things are only going to get rockier through election day and there s new evidence suggesting that elections are

various remarks about future expectations plans and prospects for matrix service company that constitute forward looking statements for the purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements as a result of the various factors including those disclosed in our annual report on form 10 k for our fiscal year ended june 30 2019 and in subsequent filings made by the company with the sec to the extent the company utilizes non gaap measure reconciliations will be provided in various press releases periodic sec filings and on the company s website i will now turn the call over to john hewitt president and ceo of matrix service company john r hewitt president and chief executive officer thank you kellie and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us as we have referenced on our prior earnings calls and countless conversations our corporate values and sense of purpose is at the heart of everything we do at matrix and influences our thinking about the company s long term strategy the issue of purpose for matrix service company is one that we have given a lot of thought to our purpose is to build a brighter future improve quality of life and create long term value for our people business partners shareholders and communities this focus is integrated in our strategy and the commitments we make every day fulfilling our purpose requires that we also achieve a consistent level of performance which allows us to invest in our people and our business deliver on our commitments and brand promise and achieve sustainable long term value for our stakeholders this quarter s call will address strategic decisions made to ensure we are able to do so turning now to our business discussion our second quarter results were decidedly mixed as market challenges and performance issues in select parts of our business overshadowed strong performance elsewhere as a result we have made strategic organizational decisions that we believe are necessary to better position the company for success in the end markets with the greatest potential for long term growth i ll discuss these decisions further as i comment on each segment underpinning these decisions is a strong balance sheet and liquidity which will allow us to execute our strategy for improved performance and growth specifically in the storage solutions segment our project performance and execution has been exceptional creating earnings greater than plan and our opportunity pipeline continues to be strong while the book to bill for the second quarter may not numerically support this subsequent bookings in january verbal awards and contract discussions along with a strong near term proposal outflow would indicate otherwise for example in january we announced a formal selection of matrix service company as the epc contractor for eagle lngs mid scale lng export facility in jacksonville florida eagle lng is investing over 500 million to bring this project to fruition the epc contract represents a significant portion of this investment however it is not in our reported q2 backlog the facility will have a production capacity of approximately 1 65 million lng gallons per day with 12 million gallons of storage plus marine terminal and truck loading capabilities this facility is the most recent example of our position as a leader in the small to mid scale lng terminal market overall the outlook for this segment remains very strong with the potential value of lng and ngl storage and terminal work to matrix over the next 12 months to exceed 2 billion oil gas chemical segment performed at a high level with strong direct margins but a soft turnaround season for our principal clients reduced our overall volumes leaving construction overhead costs under absorbed specifically turnaround activities in the quarter were smaller in scope than previous periods and our principal clients are off cycle for heavy turnarounds both of which resulted in lower volume we expect turnaround volumes to improve in the back half of the calendar year we re also involved in other activity in the oil gas and chemical space for example our construction teams are executing the installation of the previously announced first ever alkylation unit in the u s designed to use ionic liquids at chevron s salt lake city refinery this unit will replace an existing hf alkylation unit to produce high octane cleaner burning fuels using a more environmentally friendly process in the midstream gas processing space it is anticipated that the industry requires another 1 2 billion in new gas processing facilities to kick off in the next 12 months our epc service offering is gaining strong brand awareness and the opportunities available to us is growing we expect this work will add solid incremental value to this segment and our business the operating results for the industrial segment were also strong in the quarter as we reached mechanical completion of a major capital construction project for u s steel that said rapidly changing market dynamics in the iron and steel industry which comprises the majority of the revenue for this segment have also resulted in a strategic decision to reduce our reliance on this end market we do not come to this decision lightly but chose this path for the following reasons we previously communicated that we saw softening in the market in the second half of the year this downturn is looking more significant than previously expected given the commodity price environment contributing factors are trade and global economic issues as well as supply demand imbalances all of which have resulted in these producers looking to alternative business models shuttering facilities furloughing workers and minimizing maintenance and capital spending this combined with the fact that there are very few integrated iron and steel producers left presents a level of client concentration and a business risk that is no longer aligned with our long term growth strategy or financial targets finally as communicated on previous calls over the past two years we ve been executing a major capital project for a u s steel led joint venture called pro tec that was scheduled to be complete at the end of our fiscal second quarter we formally achieved mechanical completion on late november and moved our construction team off site in late december with this project complete future earnings for this part of our business were expected to decline that decline as i said earlier has an exacerbated by the other market dynamics just discussed our strategic decision to reduce our focus on this end market while best for the enterprise long term materially impacts our industrial segment revenue as well as related construction overhead cost recovery and margin it also required us to take a non cash impairment charge in the quarter we are working to reorganize the operations to reflect the revised focus on this market as well as monetize the associated business assets that no longer fit that strategy turning now to our electrical infrastructure segment results in the quarter continue to be disappointing despite the fact that matrix has enjoyed a long history of profitable performance as a contractor of choice in the northeast as you may recall we made a shift three years ago away from full epc project generation and construction projects to one that focuses on smaller package work such as centerline erection mechanical or electrical service to other epc contractors or generation owners that shift has been highly successful for us and there is an underlying strength in the segment the balance of the revenue in this segment is provided by power delivery services where localized operating issues have negatively impacted results access to the right talent pool has also been an impediment to organic expansion of our transmission and distribution services and led to poor project execution and low volumes while over 50 of this segment is and has been operating at or above our expected performance level albeit with reduced volumes the impact of the issue just discussed have caused a non cash impairment in the quarter after extensive analysis the company has implemented a performance improvement plan for this portion of the operation which we are confident will increased revenue volume gross margins overall performance as the changes in that plan take hold we remain confident in the strategic direction of this market and our ability to achieve our performance expectations and while also growing our base through strategic acquisitions there is no question expanding our work in electrical infrastructure segment remains an important part of our long term strategy that said before focusing further on expansion we want to achieve performance improvement from the corrective actions we have identified and implemented despite the challenges in our industrial and electrical infrastructure segments matrix service company continues to be in a strong position with very robust opportunities we remain committed to entering markets with long term infrastructure spending needs diversified revenue streams to include markets that are not as commodity price sensitive and creating a better connection to the growing renewable energy market we have developed and are implementing a performance improvement plan that includes a reduction of resources overhead support and capital expenditures as well as organizational changes all of which will result in improved operating performance across the organization while there will be some restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter and we may see smaller near term top line our performance supports our adjusted strategic focus and it s designed to improve our competitive platform deliver a higher standard of performance and achieve best better bottom line results the big picture for our strategic objectives is to improve overall project and business profitability and predictability attack the gas value chain for midstream processing to our core capabilities and specialty vessels and terminals for ngls and lng expand our refining services market share in north america move into chemicals and petrochemicals with our full suite of services and secure more fixed base maintenance operations grow electrical infrastructure to a nationwide footprint for transmission distribution substations and storm response we will also define our role in renewables batteries and digital technology we will maintain our brand leading position in crude tanks and terminals while further expanding our tank products offering and finally we will deploy our storage and terminal capabilities internationally into the caribbean mexico and south america while we are operating the business at a lower revenue run rate matrix will be leaner and a more focused company our business today is anchored by our storage solutions segment where we are a leader in epc and fabrication of aboveground storage tanks specialty vessels and terminals our oil gas and chemical business lays a great foundation for process industry growth and we are intently focused on fixing issues that have plagued our electrical segment and are confident that we will be able to do so matrix continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position which reflects the company s financial stability and ability to execute our business plan i ll now turn the call over to kevin kevin s cavanah chief financial officer thanks john i m going to start off by discussing significant non cash items impacting our financial results the first item is the goodwill impairment recorded in electrical infrastructure segments the power delivery portion of the segment has a long history of strong financial performance the segment historically produced gross margins of 9 to 12 while portions of this segments power delivery business and the power generation package will still operate at that historical level every units within the business have recently underperformed that poor performance increased in the second quarter and deteriorated the overall operating results for the electrical segment which required us to record the 24 9 million impairment on an after tax basis impairment charge on electrical had a 0 70 0 74 per share impact as john said the long term market opportunity remains strong and we are confident we will successfully correct the underperforming portions of this business the second item is the impairment of the industrial segment the operating results for the industrial segment have been strong in recent quarters however the prospects for the industrial segment deteriorated significantly in the quarter as john discussed based on that outlook we recorded an 8 million impairment of goodwill and a 5 6 million impairment of certain intangibles on an after tax basis the non cash impairment charges in industrial had a 0 40 per share impact the next item is tied to the change in the industrial business and the associated impact to the operating performance in a specific entity in canada this change required us to record a valuation allowance of 2 4 million on certain deferred tax assets the non cash valuation allowance had a 0 09 per share impact in the quarter the earnings per share for the quarter was a loss of 1 04 which included these three non cash items that reduced earnings by 1 23 per share excluding the non cash items the quarterly adjusted earnings per share was 0 19 it is important to note that many portions of the business performed well in the quarter which i will discuss further in the segment discussion now i will move to the operating results for the quarter in the second quarter we produced revenue of 319 million a modest decrease of 6 4 from revenue of 341 million last year our gross margin in the quarter was 9 4 as compared to 8 2 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 overall project execution was strong and all segments except electrical infrastructure margins were also impacted by under recovery of construction overhead costs in a couple of segments our sg a was 23 2 million in the quarter as compared to 22 4 million in the same quarter last year our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10 5 compared to 27 4 for the same period a year ago we previously expected our fiscal 2020 effective tax rate to be approximately 27 however the rate was negatively impacted by the valuation allowance placed on certain deferred tax assets and goodwill impairment charges that were not fully deductible we now expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 28 for the remainder of the fiscal year adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 12 6 million or 3 9 of revenue compared to 10 4 million or 3 of revenue in the prior year moving to backlog our backlog was 872 million at december 31st 2019 compared to 1 08 billion at september 30th 2019 the quarterly book to bill ratio of 0 6 on project awards of 1 97 in addition the company had cancellation of previously awarded previously awarded work of 88 million in the quarter related to the changes in the industrial segment backlog at december 31st 2019 does not include our selection for the significant multi year project with eagle lng announced in january 2020 with construction expected to begin later this year now let s talk about specific results for each of our segments revenue for the electrical infrastructure segment decreased from 58 million in the three months ended december 31st 2018 to 28 million in the recently completed quarter the decrease is primarily due to lower volumes of power delivery and power generation package work the segment gross margin was a negative 9 6 in the quarter compared to a positive 6 1 in the fiscal 2019 second quarter the fiscal 2020 gross margin was negatively impacted by poor execution in portions of the segment including a charge on our transmission and distribution upgrade project the company is implementing a performance improvement plan for the electrical segment which we are confident will increase revenue volume gross margins and overall performance as the changes from that plan and take hold revenue for the oil gas and chemical segment was 56 million in the second quarter compared to 86 million in the same period last year the decrease of 30 million is due to lower volumes of turnaround work while our crews were busy on turnarounds the size and scope of those turnaround activities was lower than normal in the quarter the segment gross margin was 7 5 for the quarter compared to 10 6 in the same period last year project execution was strong which resulted in good direct margins but the lower volume of work led to under recovery of construction overhead costs which negatively impacted gross margin revenue volumes and gross margins are expected to increase in the last half of fiscal 2020 from increased capital and engineering work revenue for the storage solutions segment was 143 million for the three months ended december 31st 2019 compared to 126 million in the same period last year the increase resulted from tank and terminal construction work and higher levels of capital work in canada excellent project execution resulted in a segment gross margin of 13 9 in the quarter compared to 8 9 in the three months ended december 31st 2018 the outlook for the storage solutions segment remained strong for both revenue and margins for the remainder of fiscal 2020 revenue for the industrial segment was 90 million in the quarter compared to 70 million in the same period last year the increase was due to higher volumes of iron and steel work including revenue from the large capital projects the segment gross margin was 9 9 compared to 5 7 in the same period of fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020 segment gross margin was positively impacted by good project execution on both capital and repair and maintenance projects however as a result of the change in the business we expect the revenue and volume in the industrial segment to decrease significantly beginning in the third quarter now i will briefly discuss the results for the year to date consolidated revenue was 657 million for the six months ended december 31st 2019 compared to 659 million in the prior fiscal year on a segment basis revenue decreased 48 million in oil gas and chemical and 41 million in electrical infrastructure these decreases were partially offset by a 54 million increase in storage solutions and a 33 million increase in industrial consolidated gross profit increased to 62 5 million in the current year compared to 51 3 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year gross margin increased to 9 5 in fiscal 2020 compared to 7 8 in fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020 gross margin was positively impacted by strong project execution in the storage solutions and industrial segments in oil gas and chemical segment project execution was strong with the lower volume of work led to under recovery of construction overhead costs gross margin in the electrical infrastructure segment was negatively impacted by poor project execution consolidated sg a expenses were 46 9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 compared to 43 6 million in the same period a year earlier the increase was primarily due to investments to support the business as well as a bad debt charge our effective tax rate for the six 6 months ended december 31st 2019 was 2 6 compared to 23 7 for the same period a year ago the fiscal 2020 tax rate was impacted by second quarter events including the valuation allowance placed on certain deferred tax assets and goodwill impairment charges that were not fully deductible for the six months ended december 31st 2019 we produced a loss of 0 81 per fully diluted share compared to earnings of 0 23 per fully diluted share in the six months ended december 31st 2018 excluding the impact of the non cash charges we produce adjusted earnings per share of 0 41 in the first six months of fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda for the first six months of fiscal 2020 was 26 6 million or 4 1 of revenue compared to 18 million or 2 7 of revenue in the prior year moving on to our balance sheet and liquidity our financial position remained strong with current liquidity at 276 million we ended the quarter with a cash balance of 110 million and borrowings of only 15 million availability under our credit facility is 166 million our capital expenditures in the quarter were 5 8 million which is about 1 8 of revenue our capital expenditures were 14 5 million or 2 2 of revenue for the six months of the year as we previously mentioned we are reducing our capital spending plans in the last half of the year and expect to end the year with capital expenditures of about 1 5 of annual revenue during the quarter we executed on the stock buyback that we announced in early november the buyback consisted of 500 000 shares at a total cost of 9 9 million given the strength of the company and our outlook on the business we will utilize our financial resources appropriately to maintain shareholder value including stock buybacks our approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet and good liquidity remains we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions but will do so in a manner that allows us to maintain a strong financial position our primary uses of cash are designed to strengthen shareholder value these uses includes certain strategic investments related to our business improvement plan and other organic growth initiatives strategic acquisitions capital expenditures and do share repurchases now let s discuss guidance based on the performance of the electrical infrastructure segment lower projected volumes in the industrial segment and other business priorities the company is executing on a business improvement plan in connection with this improvement plan the company anticipates a reduction in its annual operating cost of at least 12 million and a reduction of approximately 10 million in fiscal 2020 capital spending the company also expects to incur restructuring costs of 4 million to 6 million primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 related to the plan given the changes in our business we are updating our previous guidance taking into account the company s positive outlook in the oil gas and chemical and storage solutions segments the business improvement plan in the electrical infrastructure segment and the expected revenue reduction in the industrial segment we now expect fiscal 2020 revenue to be between 1 2 billion and 1 3 billion and to report a loss per fully diluted share of between 0 45 and 0 65 excluding the non cash charges incurred in the second quarter and the restructuring cost planned in the second half of the year the company expects to report adjusted fully diluted earnings per share of between 0 70 and 0 90 for fiscal 2020 we will now open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of john franzreb with sidoti your line is open john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst good morning john and kevin john r hewitt president and chief executive officer good morning kevin s cavanah chief financial officer good morning john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst i guess i want to start with the industrial business could you just kind of clarify what your business plans there are are you getting of just the steel side or the entire business what are your plans there and what kind of timing are we thinking about in exiting it john r hewitt president and chief executive officer so our industrial segment john is made up of several industries and markets that we work in iron and steel being the largest on that on both sides of the border u s and canada we also have mining and mineral operations we work do thermal vacuum chamber work we do material handling kind of projects in grain and cement and so the iron and steel piece is the one that we are minimizing our operations in right now we are sort of downsizing our presence there from day to day maintenance and small project capability we will continue to be opportunistic to look at say turnarounds or larger capital projects there like we would do really in any of our businesses but the we re expecting a pretty big reduction in the revenues because of that change and just because of what s going on in that market but the iron and steel business to be clear in the industrial segment the iron and steel business depending on what was going on in that market represented anywhere from 50 to 75 of revenues in that segment john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst okay and that steel businesses i think you referenced in your press release is the business you would look to sell and not the entire industrial base john r hewitt president and chief executive officer yeah correct correct john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst and i guess just to stick with the industrial what would your plans be to continue to grow the business the whole point of getting into this marketplace was diversification how do you continue to plan to diversify the business mix or don t you for the foreseeable future john r hewitt president and chief executive officer no i mean what we so one of the things we like about the electrical piece and obviously we ve got some pieces that we ve got we ve got to fix but we think there is a lot of growth potential for us in the electrical infrastructure piece there is decades of capital spending requirements across north america to improve the overall power delivery segment for the country the grid and it s not a commodity as commodity price sensitive as some of the other things that we re into so whether that s being connected to into refining and that connection back up into the mid stream markets for us so that s an area of growth for us another area of growth for us is in the chemical market that s an area of business that we do virtually nothing in today so while we ve got a great footprint in refining both in turnarounds and projects and associated storage facilities with that we re our work in that chemical petrochemical market is really limited only to storage applications so we feel that there is a lot of opportunity for us to grow their leading with engineering content for us and then bringing our construction operations to that and then one of the other things other things we ve identified is the international market so when we talk about international market we re looking into the caribbean mexico latin and south america we are experiencing a lot of pull through opportunity there for our domestic clients that are moving energy resources into those markets and so while we re building our facilities here in the u s it also gives us the opportunity to build the receiving terminals in those other markets so those would be three of the areas for us where we would see growth opportunities and the electrical one would help us it would help us to minimize the cyclicality of the rest of the business john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst so just to tie a bow around that how long is this process expected to take the finding of new personnel to run electrical the drawdown in steel is that a one quarter process six month quarter process and what are we talking about here john r hewitt president and chief executive officer i think both of those things will be fundamentally put in place by the end of this fiscal year and improvement overall improvement in the electrical markets while we expect some improvements through the back end of this fiscal year we would hope within the 12 month period we ll start to get back to expected performance level john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst okay and one last one i ll get back into queue the eagle project can you give us a sense of the size scope of the project when do you expect it to hit the p l initially and how long of a duration it will be john r hewitt president and chief executive officer it s approximately i don t really know the schedule completely it s probably around 30 month project and we don t normally give out the project sizes but we re the epc contractor so all the engineering the procurement all the construction of process facility the marine terminaling works all the things of storage all the balance of plan all that is all within our purview so you could think about the size of that versus the clients investment in sort of the 60 to 70 kind of range john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst okay fair enough thanks i ll hop back into queue john r hewitt president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill newby with d a davidson your line is open william newby d a davidson co analyst good morning and thanks for taking my questions john r hewitt president and chief executive officer going morning bill kevin s cavanah chief financial officer good morning william newby d a davidson co analyst i guess kevin just a first one on the guidance i mean can you help us a little bit on like what operating assumptions you are taken into account for these two businesses that are undergoing the strategic actions at the low and the high end kevin s cavanah chief financial officer yeah so first we looked at in industrial we did about 90 million of revenue this quarter produced some good operating income as john said the steel business is 50 to 75 of the that segment so two thirds of that segment is kind of going away starting in the third quarter so you know that segments is not going to produce any measurable operating income in the last half of the year at least i wouldn t expect it to now the electrical segment we did 30 million of revenues this quarter we did a similar number in the first quarter we do have an improvement plan in place it will take time to get it get the changes made so we re not expecting significant improvement on the top line in the back half i mean the revenue should be in that 30 million to 40 million range i would think per quarter and then if you think about margins you know we think we ll get it back to that historical range eventually i wouldn t expect that in this fiscal year so you re still going to have mid single digit margin probably in that business this year as we implement the changes now when you look at the other two segments the storage segment was extremely strong over 140 million of revenue i think that will grow some here in the last half year and the margin performance should continue to be really strong here we ve got a good backlog of projects and when you look at oil gas and chemical segment we noted that the project execution was strong in the quarter it was just the volume was low and we think that volume is going to increase in the last half on additional capital work and additional engineering work so i think we should see a decent increase in volume for oil gas and chemical so those are the two segments that are going to carry the operating results for the company in the last half william newby d a davidson co analyst got it i guess any additional color on what gives you comfort that the volumes in oil gas and chemicals will recover here in the near term and i guess i mean yeah i guess just any help you can give us there i think we are all looking for those volumes to recover here in the december quarter so i guess what gives you guys confidence you ll see it here in march or kevin s cavanah chief financial officer yeah i think that i think the expectation in this recent quarter was more around turnaround and while our crews were busy the size and scope of those turnarounds did not end up being they didn t have been the type of turnarounds that balloon themselves to a strong quarter like we had in the you know in the third and the four quarter last year and when we think about what we expect in the back half it s not based on turnaround improvement it s based upon projects in that are new construction capital projects or engineering that are that are either booked or very high probability of being booked so that gives us more confidence in where that increase is coming john r hewitt president and chief executive officer the only other thing to think about too is that contractors turnaround contractors follows their client and so we may one of our competitors may be saying they re having a strong turnaround session in the fall or the spring and that s because the clients that they normally do business with on a consistent basis happen to be in that cycle at that time and that the owners that we do business for maybe off cycle so so we ve had this year is a little bit an off cycle year for our clients lower levels of heavy turnarounds and kind of smaller some smaller scope mechanical turnarounds we expect that to flip slip for us probably not in the fall i m sorry probably not in the spring but as we move into the fall of this calendar year we expect that turnaround mix to flip toward more toward clients that we do that we consistent business with kevin s cavanah chief financial officer yeah and the engineering work i referenced is lot of that is only gas value chain which is a growth area we ve talked about william newby d a davidson co analyst got it that s helpful and then just another one on electrical i mean it sounds like there is one specific t d project that s causing a lot of the headaches there i mean any color on how much you guys have left on that project john r hewitt president and chief executive officer i think we re about 70 complete kevin s cavanah chief financial officer yeah i think that s about right william newby d a davidson co analyst okay thank you and then just one quick kind of housekeeping the 12 million in operating cost reductions any i mean it sound i mean it s all on the obviously in electrical and industrial any color on how you expect that to be split as we kind of think about modeling it out john r hewitt president and chief executive officer split between like line items in the income statement or segment william newby d a davidson co analyst no just in terms of i mean how much of the cost are you taking out of electrical versus how much of the cost will be coming out of industrial just how any what kind of how it will be allocated between the two segments john r hewitt president and chief executive officer you know i think more of it s coming out of the industrial piece but there are probably 60 70 of that will be industrial but for both businesses there is also support related costs that are included in that amount that support the whole business because that s part of a larger subsidiary that the volume for that larger subsidiary is decreasing so they ve got to right size the overall structure and that s already been going on william newby d a davidson co analyst got it i got a couple more but i ll jump back in queue for now thanks guys john r hewitt president and chief executive officer thanks you operator thank you we have a follow up question from the line of john franzreb your line is open john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst yeah just maybe to continue a little bit on the electrical john when you look at the bookings know you ve been working to kind of right size that business to make it more profitable you ve announced sweeping changes on the managerial and mid level managerial levels could you just talk about what you feel that the opportunities that you ve been missing out on that warrants such changes i mean what type of business have you not gotten your fair share of now some sort of color as what you think this the unit has missed john r hewitt president and chief executive officer some of the things that s going on here there has been some structural changes in their market so we ve talked forever about being too centric on the northeast that we re too dependent on too few clients and it s necessary for us to grow that business that thesis still exists and it s still something we need to do and there s just but there s been some changes there on how are those clients particularly that are associated with this one this one unit within that business they re buying their work so there used to be a lot of more reimbursable kind of projects they were more callout kind of maintenance they were not bidding as many as possible and so the people within that business unit weren t necessarily used to operate in that fashion and as that market changed over it changes the dynamics of how we chased work how we win work how we execute work how we estimate it and so those are things that we ve got to catch up on and we ve got fix within those businesses so and there s been a lot of money spent over the last few years on storm hardenings and things that were done associated with hurricane sandy a lot of that work has been identified has been completed and so now as those utilities move back into sort of more of a normal cadence and repair cycle we ve got to get ourselves aligned with where they re spending their dollars so those are kind of the issues and so it kind of changes our the way we sell ourselves there the way market our services into those regions and so we got to make sure that we ve got the right folks in place to be able to market and sell the business so it s more there is going to be more aggressive selling by the organization than as opposed to the client fixes a times and gives you a call john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst so to expand geographically are you thinking that we need some sort outside the northeast some nearby adjacent geography is the best way to go or do you look further out for the opportunities that might be in i don t know the southwest for just to throw something out there how does that work john r hewitt president and chief executive officer so i think for the purposes of expansion we re going to be looking for acquisitions to do that if you re moving or if you re moving organically especially in this business the ability to bring and know the local labor market to bring the capabilities in to know the clients are kind of one of the things that s stinging us on the transmission distribution project we talked about where we ve had some charges on from an acquisition standpoint you re buying into you re buying into that client resources as client contacts the labor resources the supervision in the companies that are operating in the region so it s till probably less than it s less important on an acquisition standpoint for that that acquired business to be adjacent to our existing operations because you re really there you re buying that knowhow you re buying that knowledge of the clients in the region and as opposed to trying to put your own folks in there john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst okay okay fair enough and one last question did i hear correctly that you used about half of your share repurchase authorization kevin s cavanah chief financial officer our authorization is limited to 30 million a year calendar year so no one expect us to do that much but we re in a position where we could do significant buyback here that s what we choose to do john franzreb sidoti company llc analyst okay all right guys thanks for taking my questions john r hewitt president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of noelle dilts with stifel your line is open noelle dilts stifel nicolaus company inc analyst hi guys thanks just one really quick question on the t d project that s 70 complete are you just booking the remainder of that revenue at no margin at this point or at lower margin just curious how the rest of that plays out john r hewitt president and chief executive officer i would expect it to be booked at a it is zero margin assuming the forecast we have in there is correct noelle dilts stifel nicolaus company inc analyst okay perfect thanks so much john r hewitt president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you i m not showing any further questions i would now like to turn the call over to john hewitt for closing remarks john r hewitt president and chief executive officer well thank you for visiting with us today i want to

gaap measures in this release to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap these non gaap measures include adjusted net earnings adjusted diluted earnings per common share and adjusted ebitda the reconciliation of each of these non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure is provided in the tables following this section non gaap measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap as they exclude certain items as described below these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted net earnings available to class a common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share of class a common stock bellring believes adjusted net earnings available to class a common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share of class a common stock are useful to investors in evaluating bellring s operating performance because they exclude items that affect the comparability of bellring s financial results and could potentially distort an understanding of the trends in business performance adjusted net earnings available to class a common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share of class a common stock are adjusted for the following items a separation costs bellring has excluded certain expenses incurred to effect its separation from post and to support its transition into a separate stand alone entity as the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent additionally bellring believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of bellring s current operating performance or comparisons of bellring s operating performance to other periods b income tax bellring has included the income tax impact of the non gaap adjustments using a rate described in the footnote of the reconciliation table as bellring believes that its gaap effective income tax rate as reported is not representative of the income tax expense impact of the adjustments adjusted ebitda bellring believes that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating bellring s operating performance and liquidity because i bellring believes it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets ii it presents a measure of corporate performance exclusive of bellring s capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired and iii it is a financial indicator of a company s ability to service its debt as bellring llc is required to comply with certain covenants and limitations that are based on variations of ebitda in bellring llc s financing documents management uses adjusted ebitda to provide forward looking guidance to forecast future results adjusted ebitda reflects adjustments for income tax expense interest expense net and depreciation and amortization and adjustment for separation costs discussed above additionally adjusted ebitda reflects adjustments for the following items c nci adjustment bellring has included adjustments for the portion of its consolidated net earnings loss which was allocated to nci allowing for the calculation of adjusted ebitda to include 100 of bellring d stock based compensation bellring s compensation strategy after the ipo includes the use of bellring stock based compensation to attract and retain executives and employees by aligning their long term compensation interests with bellring s stockholders investment interests bellring s compensation strategy prior to the ipo included the use of post stock based compensation to attract and retain executives and employees by aligning their long term compensation interests with post s shareholders investment interests after the ipo bellring continues to be charged for post stock based compensation through the master services agreement with post bellring has excluded stock based compensation as stock based compensation can vary significantly based on reasons such as the timing size and nature of the awards granted and subjective assumptions which are unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period and do not contribute to meaningful comparisons of bellring s operating performance to other periods reconciliation of net earnings available to class a common stockholders to adjusted net earnings available to class a

for his comments mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer good morning thank you susie good morning everyone boston scientific finished up a strong 2019 as we significantly strengthened our portfolio and capabilities for the future while delivering strong revenue and eps growth consistent with the preliminary results we announced on january 14 we delivered 14 1 operational revenue growth and 7 3 organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 19 this represents excellent growth yet was below our organic revenue guidance of 8 to 9 due primarily to our us high voltage and us ep businesses importantly operational growth outside of us in both crm and ep were solid as were worldwide results in five of our other divisions which all grew at or above market and three posted double digit growth interventional cardiology urology public health and endoscopy with today s results we disclosed adjusted eps of 0 46 in q4 exceeding the high end of guidance due largely to a 0 03 tax benefit for the full year 2019 we delivered 11 1 operational revenue growth 7 3 organic revenue a 60 basis point improvement in profitability to 26 1 and adjusted eps of 1 58 which is up 13 over the prior year which is also normalized for the 0 07 tax settlement benefit in 2018 we delivered these results while also generating approximately 2 billion in adjusted free cash flow our 2019 financials continue a five year trend of excellent results and provide solid evidence that our strategy of category leadership in key markets and portfolio diversification into higher growth adjacencies continue to deliver differentiated results our goal is to continue to execute against our strategic plan objectives further increase our organic growth profile and deliver top tier sales and eps growth results over the next five years boston scientific brings a combination of long term consistent above market revenue growth margin expansion targeted double digit adjusted eps growth and a greatly improved ability to deploy our strong free cash flow and that is what we believe positions boston scientific to continue to drive compelling shareholder value we re excited about our plans to build upon our momentum in 2020 and beyond we re targeting 2020 operational revenue growth of 10 to 12 which includes approximately 350 basis points of growth from the vertiflex and btg acquisitions resulting in full year 2020 organic revenue growth guidance of six and a half to eight and a half percent similar to the trend in 2019 given the ramp and timing of 2020 product introductions acquisitions that will turn organic in the second half as well as an expected negative first half impact of china procedure growth from coronavirus we expect to see organic revenue accelerate in the second half of 2020 in comparison to the first half of the year by approximately 200 basis points we re guiding to adjusted eps of 1 74 to 1 79 representing 10 to 13 adjusted earnings growth which includes a 0 04 to 0 05 of accretion from the btg acquisition as well as approximately 2 3 billion in adjusted free cash flow i ll now provide some highlights of our fourth quarter and 19 results along with our thoughts on 2020 outlook our revenue growth in this quarter was broad based across businesses and regions led most notably this quarter by 13 operational revenue growth in the us 12 in asia pac and 10 in europe and middle east africa emerging markets had another outstanding quarter growing operational revenue 16 in the quarter and 19 for the full year and now represent 12 of total company sales so turning to each business our med surg segment represents 31 of our revenue mix in 19 and continues to deliver excellent results with sales growth of 11 in the fourth quarter and 9 for the full year endo sales grew 10 in the quarter and 9 for the full year with fourth quarter sales led by double digit growth in our biliary franchise and infection prevention franchises endo sales also are expected to decelerate slightly in first quarter 2020 where we re targeting full year growth acceleration in endo given the breadth and strength of our category leading portfolio as well as more significant contributions from the exalt d single use scope launch in second quarter and beyond i m also pleased to announce that exalt d received ce mark in late january we ll begin the limited launch later this quarter our endo business is also advancing additional pipeline opportunities including the resolution ultra hemostasis clip and the next generation lotus therapeutic imaging portfolio called the spyglass discover which is a single use surgical scope we continue to believe our therapeutic imaging portfolio represents a differentiated opportunity in 20 and an incremental 2 billion market opportunity by 2024 turning to uro and pelvic health this franchise also continued its excellent performance growing organic sales 12 in the quarter and 8 for the full year 2019 with 15 full year operational growth and that s despite a 170 basis point headwind for the mesh withdrawal fourth quarter strength was led by double digit growth in our single use lithovue scope core stone rezum minimally invasive therapy for bph and almost doubling of spaceoar revenue as a reminder spaceoar hydrogel diminished the risk of local undesirable side effects of prostate cancer radiation therapy and continues to resonate in the marketplace and with patients resulting in 100 million in sales in 2019 in addition the rezum system recently obtained expanded commercial coverage wins this year including anthem blue cross blue shield and cigna we expect uro and pelvic health to deliver double digit revenue growth in 2020 and the continued progress of our broad portfolio and globalization efforts turning to global rhythm and neuro sales which were 1 in the fourth quarter and 3 for the full year and they represent 29 of our total mix in 19 neuromodulation delivered fourth quarter organic revenue up 8 and operational revenue up 19 the full year organic sales were up plus 7 and operational sales were up 13 as detailed last month on our investor update on the recent nans annual meeting we remain very bullish on our comprehensive portfolio and exciting pipeline in both pain and brain modulation neuromod results for the quarter were led by doubling in sales of our precise dbs system which offers unique directionality with our cartesia lead their ability to provide precise neural targeting with this lead allows physicians to optimize therapy and help reduce unwanted side effects for patients this in addition to the ce mark approval of neural navigator 3 which integrates enhanced visualization with clinical programming to simplify and accelerate physician program we expect continued strong momentum in dbs in 2020 our global spinal cord stimulation sales also improved sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter in 19 for the full year scs sales were down low single digits but we believe the scs market will return to growth in 2020 given low patient penetration rates as well as new product launches and clinical data from our team and the industry more broadly in scs wavewriter the only platform approved by the fda to provide simultaneously paresthesia based and sub perception therapy which targets two different mechanisms of action at the very same time not alternating them for patients suffering chronic pain in our combo randomized clinical trial three month data presented at nans last month wavewriter combination therapy demonstrated an 88 responder rate which is one of the highest responder rates reported among other comparable scs clinical studies also our vertiflex acquisition complements our rf ablation and scs portfolio in pain and represents an important therapy for patients with moderate lumbar stenosis vertiflex performed well in the quarter and exceeded its full year pro forma 19 sales goal of 60 million turning to crm crm sales fell 3 in the fourth quarter after growing above market in q1 through q3 they ended up 1 for the full year the weakness in fourth quarter was caused primarily by mid single digit declines in the us icd revenue with global icd sales declining low single digits fourth quarter patient revenue as expected was down low single digits worldwide and we believe that global icd softness in fourth quarter was largely related to the tough comps we faced with a global mid single digit growth comp in fourth quarter 18 in addition while we don t have all the fourth quarter inputs our best estimate is the fourth quarter 19 worldwide crm market which excludes implantable cardiac monitors likely declined low single digits in 2020 we ll aim to continue to deliver above market growth in defib due to our longevity benefits heartlogic heart failure diagnostic and emblem s icd in 2020 we remain on track to launch lux dx which is our implantable cardiac monitor by midyear but we do expect limited revenue contribution due to the revenue recognition policies overall we expect worldwide crm revenue to be more in line with the market in 2020 potentially flat to down low single digits ep sales grew 4 in the fourth quarter and for the full year 7 and us sales grew 8 in the quarter importantly international sales continued to be very strong up 15 in fourth quarter and up 16 for the full year led by the launch of our directsense catheter in europe and japan as well as continued double digit growth in major markets for our rhythmia hdx mapping system we also continue to enjoy strong response from lumipoint which is the next gen hd mapping algorithm that illuminates critical areas of the heart by utilizing user defined inputs to assist and map interpretation we continue to enhance our pipeline globally in ep and we re pleased to announce that we ve just received ce mark for our rhythmia single shot pulmonary vein isolation technology in europe we look forward to bringing polar x to the market in europe as well as beginning enrollment in our us ide trial so overall we do expect ep sales growth accelerate in 2020 as we re excited to enter the single shot market while continuing to increase our mapping and navigation footprints and also expanding the launch of our nav enabled catheter portfolio and adding new features to rhythmia mapping turning to cardiovascular this segment grew sales in fourth quarter 19 operationally and 10 organically for the full year 2019 growth is 14 on an operational basis and 9 organic and accounted for 39 of our total company sales peripheral interventions grew 4 in the quarter and 8 for the full year on organic basis and 34 for the quarter and 19 for the full year operationally with the btg interventional medicine acquisition legacy pi growth was driven by strong double digit growth in asia pac offset by a slight decline in us sales due to tough comparisons from the us launch of eluvia as well as a competitor s manufacturing issue one year ago the interventional medicine business performed in line with expectations growing plus 7 pro forma with high single digit growth in interventional oncology we expect similar global organic growth trends in pi in the first quarter of 2020 with acceleration thereafter on the integration of btg as well as important new product approvals such as ranger dcb which is supported by great new head to head data from the compare trial which was just released last week at length interventional cardiology continues to grow nicely above market delivering 13 organic and operational revenue growth in the quarter for the full year ic organic sales grew 10 which is a 550 basis point increase versus 18 while operational sales were up 11 for the full year we delivered coronary therapies

large proximal vessels megatron will be is launching in europe now and is on track for a second half 2020 us launch strong structural heart sales then drove the ic sales of 13 overall in the quarter strong growth across our structural heart platforms led to achievement at the high end of our 19 revenue guidance of 700 to 725 million which is up over 50 versus 18 watchman achieved its strongest quarterly growth rates for the year in fourth quarter as we continue to focus on four important areas market development and education continued pursuit of clinical evidence to understand the benefits of watchman in broader patient populations including lower risk patients to be enrolled in the head to head champion af study no 3 product enhancements such as the next gen watchman flx which is expected to launch in the us in second half of this year and fourth and lastly geographic expansion in japan and other countries turning to tavr we continue to be pleased with the launch and progress of lotus edge and remain on track to open 150 accounts in the first 12 months post approval we also recently received lotus edge reimbursement approval in japan we ll begin a limited market release over the coming months our supra annular valve offering accurate neo grew mid teens in the quarter and we look forward to launch of the next generation accurate neo2 in europe midyear in sentinel which is the only cerebral embolic protection device is now in over 600 us hospitals we estimate that sentinel is approaching 20 of the overall us tavr procedural penetration and we believe definitive evidence focused on a stroke endpoint will continue to elevate sentinel to become the standard of care for all patients and will help influence future clinical guidelines to that end we look forward to beginning to roll in this quarter the protected tavr randomized clinical trial finally mitral field we are pleased to have entered the clinic in december in australia with our millipede full annuloplasty ring for mitral valve repair we re targeting enrollment in our early feasibility study in the us by the end of 2020 so with our portfolio of watchman accurate lotus sentinel and millipede

segments i detailed fourth quarter btg spec pharma revenue of 58 million brought full year pro forma sales to 250 million which is down slightly year over year and also in line with our expectations

employees and their winning spirit and commitment to patients so i ll turn things over to dan for a detailed review of our financials dan brennan executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mike fourth quarter consolidated revenue of 2 905 000 000 represents 13 4 reported revenue growth and reflects an 18 million headwind from foreign exchange slightly less than the 20 million to 25 million headwinds expected at the time of guidance on an operational basis revenue growth was 14 1 in the quarter sales from the vertiflex and btg acquisitions partially offset by the divestiture of our legacy embolic beads portfolio contributed a net 680 basis points of growth at the high end of our acquisition contribution guidance range of the 680 basis points btg contributed 610 million split between interventional medicine contributing 380 and specialty pharmaceuticals 230 the resulting 7 3 organic revenue growth in the quarter was below our organic guidance range of 8 to 9 as mike detailed despite the miss we delivered q4 adjusted earnings per share of 0 46 above our guidance range of 0 42 to 0 45 representing 16 year over year growth and 19 growth excluding the 0 01 net tax benefit in q4 2018 earnings were driven by healthy p l metrics across the board as well as an approximate 0 03 tax benefit higher than expected at the time of our preliminary fourth quarter and full year results announcement the tax benefit is related to both discrete tax items within the quarter as well as the lower full year operational tax rate which i will detail shortly the fx impact on adjusted earnings per share was immaterial as expected at the time of guidance our full year 2019 consolidated revenue of 10 735 000 000 grew 9 3 on a reported basis and 11 1 on an operational basis which includes 380 basis points of growth related to the acquisitions of nxthera claret augmenix vertiflex and btg net the divestiture of the beads portfolio operational growth was in line with our guidance as the contribution from acquisitions was slightly higher than our expectations and organic growth of 7 3 was slightly below our guidance of approximately 7 5 full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share of 1 58 represents 8 growth or 13 excluding the 2018 net tax benefit of 0 07 in the base adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 73 1 just above the midpoint of our guidance range and an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year due to manufacturing improvements favorable fx and mix driven primarily by strong sales in our watchman franchise for the full year 2019 adjusted gross margin was 72 4 within our guidance range and represents 10 basis points improvement over 2018 the full year impact of fx to adjusted gross margin was a positive 70 basis points in line with our expectations and along with manufacturing improvements was offset by price erosion primarily in coronary drug eluting stents and pacers adjusted sg a expenses were 1 026 000 000 or 35 3 of sales in q4 above our guidance range primarily due to the lower sale but an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year period throughout the year we balanced the need to fund initiatives related to key commercial launches and recent acquisitions with our commitment to operating expense control and optimization as a result we were able to achieve our full year 2019 guidance and decreased adjusted sg a spending by 30 basis points year over year to 35 1 adjusted research and development expenses were 297 million in the fourth quarter or 10 2 of sales which is down 60 basis points from q4 2018 primarily due to the timing of certain investments and we re also gaining traction within our r d efficiency efforts for the full year 2019 adjusted r d expenses were 1 138 000 000 or 10 6 of sales compared to 10 7 in 2018 royalty expense was 0 6 of sales in q4 and the full year 2019 which was roughly flat year over year for both periods as a result q4 2019 adjusted operating margin of 27 improved 150 basis points year over year and is within our guidance range of 27 to 28 we also met our full year 2019 adjusted operating margin commitment with a rate of 26 1 representing an improvement of 60 basis points over the full year 2018 i ll now move below the line to interest and other expense adjusted interest expense for the quarter was 93 million compared to 62 million in q4 of 2018 our average interest rate expense was 6 6 in q4 2019 or 3 4 excluding the bond repurchase costs related to our eurobond offering compared to 3 5 in q4 of 2018 adjusted other expense for the quarter was 17 million compared to adjusted other income of 4 million a year ago primarily due to a net gain on certain of our available for sale investments in q4 2018 and both periods include expenses related to our foreign exchange hedging program for the full year 2019 adjusted interest expense and adjusted other expenses were 325 million and 65 million respectively resulting in total below the line expenses of 390 million this is in line with guidance and an increase from 2018 largely due to the acquisition of btg as well as the make whole call exercised in q1 of 2019 to execute the early retirement of our 2020 notes our tax rate for the fourth quarter was four and a half percent on an adjusted basis below our guidance of approximately 11 due to discrete tax benefits within the quarter as well as a lower full year operational tax rate our full year tax rate was 7 3 on an adjusted basis also below our guidance of approximately 9 due to the lower operational tax rate on a gaap basis our tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year included a deferred tax benefit of 4 1 billion related to transfers of certain intellectual property rights among our various wholly owned subsidiaries these transactions more closely align the global economic ownership of our intellectual property rights with our current and future business operations we ended q4 2019 with 1 413 000 000 and full year 2019 with 1 411 000 000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was 638 million compared to 659 million in q4 2018 in the quarter we used cash primarily to pay down 900 million of btg related debt executing on our plan to achieve a debt leverage ratio of approximately 2 6 times ebitda by the end of 2020 as of december 31st 2019 we had cash on hand of 217 million our full year 2019 adjusted free cash flow of 2 billion is lower than guidance and down slightly year over year as a result of the timing of capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements mainly in inventory to support upcoming new product launches we continue to target double digit adjusted free cash flow growth in the future and our goal for full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow is 2 3 billion which would represent 15 growth over 2019 on a gaap basis we recorded a net litigation related charge of 223 million in the fourth quarter primarily related to litigation with channel medsystems this drove a 129 million sequential increase in our total legal reserve to 697 million as of december 31st 2019 which otherwise would have decreased sequentially as we continue to work to fully resolve the mesh litigation over 95 of all known claims are settled or in the final stages of settlement and we expect to pay the remaining 115 million of anticipated payments into the qualified settlement funds in 2020 which will then resolve all significant existing contingencies related to mesh as a reminder this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement funds to plaintiffs capital expenditures for the full year 2019 totaled 461 million above the high end of our range of 375 to 400 million primarily due to timing and some pull forward from 2020 in manufacturing capacity in anticipation of certain 2020 product launches we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 450 to 475 million for 2020 as we continue to build capacity integrate acquisitions and position the company for growth i ll now walk through guidance for q1 and the full year 2020 for the full year we expect 2020 reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 10 to 12 which corresponds to 6 5 to 8 5 on an organic basis with an approximate 350 basis point contribution from the vertiflex and btg acquisitions net the divestiture of the beads portfolio as a reminder vertiflex is included in organic guidance for 2020 as of june and btg as of august at which time the divested beads portfolio will also no longer have an operational impact we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately 30 to 40 million for the full year 2020 however as i ll detail shortly due to our hedging program we expect the fx impact to eps to be neutral for the year we expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72 for the full year with no fx impact we do not anticipate material improvement over full year 2019 as manufacturing improvements will be offset by pricing declines which are expected to be slightly higher than usual due to biannual japan price cuts and china tenders in addition to mixed challenges from our new high growth products that are initially dilutive to total company gross margin such as exalt d polar x and lotus edge we expect full year adjusted sg a to be in the range of 34 5 to 35 this assumes up to 60 basis points of improvement over 2019 as we continue to execute on our cost optimization initiatives and also recognize the benefits of programs currently under way full year adjusted r d is expected to be in the range of 10 to 10 and a half percent and we expect our royalty rate to remain at less than 1 of sales for 2020 this implies a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of approximately 26 7 which represents 60 basis points of improvement over 2019 consistent with our previously outlined goal of 50 to 100 basis points of annual improvement we continue to make progress toward our long term goal of 30 adjusted operating margin we forecast our full year 2020 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 10 consistent with our disclosure in january this assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 11 with an approximate 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation we expect adjusted below the line expenses which include interest payments dilution from our vc portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately 400 to 425 million for the year and we expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1 417 000 000 shares for q1 2020 and 1 421 000 000 shares for full year 2020 as a result we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of 1 74 to 1 79 representing 10 to 13 adjusted earnings growth and we expect fx to be neutral for the year if rates hold constant on a gaap basis we expect earnings per share to be in a range of 0 95 to 1 now turning to q1 2020 we anticipate reported revenue growth to be in the range of approximately 10 to 12 which represents 11 to 13 operational growth and an approximately 600 basis point contribution from the vertiflex and btg acquisitions net the divestiture of the beads portfolio on an organic basis we believe our business without the impact of the coronavirus would be in a range of 6 to 7 5 growth year over year however while we re still in the very early stages of assessing the impact and highly focused on supporting our patients and employees in china we believe it is prudent to include a potential impact to our q1 revenue related to the coronavirus our best estimate at this time is a preliminary 10 million to 40 million potential negative impact to revenue as a result of deferred procedures supply chain and other disruptions although it is early the chinese healthcare system is highly focused on containing the spread of the virus thus we expect to see a reduction in volume for all nonemergency medical device procedures as it will not be business as usual in china in february and march this 10 million to 40 million potential negative impact resulted in q1 20 organic growth guidance of 5 to 7 full year organic growth of 6 5 to 8 5 contemplates our ability to recapture some of the lost procedure volume in china during the year as well as other offsets throughout the remainder of the year note that given the leap year q1 includes an extra selling day over prior year but this equates to roughly one half of a day sequentially based on the weighted average of selling days globally we expect the foreign exchange impact on q1 revenue to be an approximate 25 to 30 million headwind for the first quarter adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 0 37 to 0 40 per share representing 6 to 15 growth and gaap earnings per share is expected to be in a range of 0 16 to 0 19 per share please check our investor relations website for q4 2019 financial and operational highlights which outlines q4 and full year results as well as q1 and full year 2020 guidance including p l line item guidance so with that i ll turn it back to susan to moderate the q a susie lisa vice president of investor relations thanks dan greg let s open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so in order to be able to take as many questions as possible please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up greg please go ahead questions answers operator thank you mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer i have a question for dan operator your first question comes from the line of robbie marcus from jp morgan please go ahead mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer robbie can you hear us robbie marcus j p morgan analyst i can hear you can you hear me mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer we can hear you now robbie marcus j p morgan analyst great you know maybe you could just start with the top line guidance for 2020 the range is a little wider than we ve seen from you historically you have a lot of new product launches into new markets in 2020 maybe just walk through the rationale for the wider guidance range and any important cadence issues to pay attention to mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer sure yeah so the full year guidance organic you heard the script there six and a half to eight and a half we think 200 basis points wide range isn t crazy for a company our size so we think that makes sense similar to 19 in 19 we saw a 6 3 organic in the first half 8 3 organic the second half and so we expect a similar trend in 2020 as i mentioned you ll see second half acceleration as mentioned due to the product cadence and we can talk about the various products if you d like as well as the m a train organic and also we expect hopefully we hopefully aim for a resolution of the potential impact in china as we enter the second quarter so we ll see second half acceleration and we expect many of our businesses to grow double digit we expect uroph and endo as well as ep all to accelerate in 2020 we expect pi to put up a first quarter similar to fourth quarter we accept expect nice acceleration due to important product launches in pi as well as the integration going on plan and we ve also given the structural heart guidance 900 to 1 billion which is a significant increase over 2019 so we re very confident in the product launches that we have across all the divisions and the execution our aim will be to accelerate organic revenue growth in 20 faster than we did in 19 robbie marcus j p morgan analyst great and maybe just a follow up on crm at the jpmorgan conference when you preannounced you thought that some of the softness in fourth quarter was due to replacements at high power have you been able to dig into that any further and come up with why maybe replacements were softer in december versus expectations mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we don t have all the market data yet it s still too early to receive kind of unit volume across the industry similar to what i mentioned before we think primarily the impact in q4 was due to our comps we had mid single digit positive comps competitors had negative comps and so we don t see a we don t believe that we lost market share in defib in fourth quarter we think we ve faced a tougher comp than our competitors did and also we don t have the icm loop recorder yet some competitors include that in their sales so in a pure like for like basis we think we held share and we do think the market s a bit softer though we think the market in 2020 we project global crm to be flat declining low single digit and we expect we obviously aim to continue to grow faster than the market like we have for many years in defib but we think the market growth is probably zero to negative two for the full year robbie marcus j p morgan analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bob hopkins from bank of america please go ahead bob hopkins bank of america merrill lynch analyst oh thank you and good morning so first question i just wanted to ask about the guidance you re providing for the first quarter that 5 to 7 and if you use the midpoint of your assumptions on coronavirus maybe 6 to 8 excluding that my question is that even excluding the slower china growth in q1 it does feel like a deceleration from what you ve been experiencing over the last couple of quarters given the selling day and an easier comp in the first quarter so what do you assume slows in q1 relative to the last couple of quarters or is this just you guys being conservative mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer sure morning bob so yeah we re very comfortable in the quarterly guidance we provided as well as the full year and we aim to accelerate in 20 over 19 organic growth which i think is the most important piece here we look at first quarter there is a extra what dan calls a half day when we look at all the global selling days and so forth so there s a slight benefit there but as mentioned in the script in a few areas we do expect to see in first quarter endo decelerate a little bit from first from fourth quarter as well as pi being soft again in first quarter similar to fourth quarter so those kind of are in line and we also see some challenges in drug eluting stents with japan price cuts as well as the overall pricing environment in drug eluting stents so we anticipate that first quarter and we talked about the crm market kind of the zero to negative two range but importantly we have some nice mixed launches in dbs to support the full year and we expect to see continued complex coronary growth do well and then all the other businesses across the company should do extremely well with structural heart but first quarter combination of some of those pricing pressures we re seeing in dbs combined with the coronavirus issue that dan outlined and really moving through that btg integration that was the guidance of the six to seven and a half pre coronavirus we estimate the impact as mentioned 10 to 40 from china which brings our first quarter guidance down to five to seven bob hopkins bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then maybe as just a sort of an obvious follow up on that what do you assume in endo slows a little bit in q1 and then also i d love to see hear your comments on exalt d in terms of what you re expecting for the year out of that product mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer yeah so endo is one of our more predictable businesses i would say in the company very good execution against our plans and it s not uncommon for them to have a slightly softer first quarter so slightly soft is going to be above the bsc average and likely above market so their definition of soft there is probably not fair but as we see as we look at the full year they have a nice set of product launches with new hemostasis clip improvements to digital spyglass and the big one the exalt d we ve had our first few cases take place over the past week and they went they re very very encouraging and so you re going to see a kind of more of a controlled launch in the first quarter to make sure things are going well a lot of the contracting in terms of the capital placements are being organized now and we re very confident in acceleration really each month in exalt with a much bigger impact in second quarter and a significant impact in the second half of the year and then the surgical scope coming so i think we re really on track with exalt d launch and couldn t be more excited about the early results bob hopkins bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you dan brennan executive vice president and chief financial officer and then just to give you a little bit of the math on the ranges so the six to seven and a half is the range without coronavirus for q1 in terms of organic revenue growth just to let you know how we got to the five to seven so the low end of five is basically the midpoint of 6 75 and we took the high end of the risk of 10 to 40 for the coronavirus and took that off to get to the five and then similarly for the high end of seven it s the seven and a half high end less the low end of the coronavirus of 10 million which brings you to the 7 so just to give you a little bit of that math as to how it came to five to seven from the six to seven and a half operator your next question comes from the line of david lewis from morgan stanley please go ahead david lewis morgan stanley analyst good morning just two questions for me dan i want to come back to coronavirus just to sort of set expectations so by our quick math china s kind of 5 of the company maybe it was a point of growth to 2019 i appreciate the focus in the first quarter but picking those numbers it seems like you re implying for first quarter that that china business is either you know a 10 grower kind of half what you grew last year 20 or maybe slightly declined is that kind of roughly accurate and what s actually in the annual guidance for impact from china given it drove a point of growth from last year then i have a quick follow up mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer sure i mean as we talked about at our investor day china was about a 500 million business growing 20 that would imply about a 600 million business in 2020 so rough math 50 million a month the 10 and the 40 are simply the impact our china team obviously very close to the issues in china on the ground that s how they size it today and so that s why we included that in the q1 guide for the full year as you saw the six and a half to eight and a half we assume that we can get some of those procedural volumes back and then other parts of the company could kick in and keep that six and a half to eight and a half organic revenue growth range intact but it s just the ability to react within q1 with the acute nature of what we see as the potential in china that s why we raised it david lewis morgan stanley analyst ok then you are seeing that impact you have seen that impact here in the early part of january into february mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer as you look at china i mean everybody sees it on the news and such they re just the number of procedures for medical device procedures in q1 is not going to be what was expected 90 or 180 days ago so certainly we are planning to see an impact in that business in q1 david lewis morgan stanley analyst ok and then just for the guidance for the year just two things maybe for dan or for mike one obviously you talked about second half acceleration maybe just help us understand the key drivers of that second half acceleration from a product perspective and kind of related to that you have two big products from a revenue perspective absolute dollar contribution or augmenix and lotus maybe just sort of talk to your confidence in those two products and what drives that back half acceleration mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer sure we have a number of things we could talk about but just to hit on the bigger ones the biggest growth driver contributor is going to be structural heart that 900 to a billion and the big impacts there are excited about led by watchman with the new watchman flx launch will happen in the us in the second half of the year and that s doing extremely well in europe and we have a number of big clinical trials so we expect very strong growth on a watchman lotus is doing very well in the market it s kind of an on plan for 150 accounts so you ll see a full year impact of lotus and we expect to see each quarter greater impact there our symetis valve accurate is doing well it grew above the company average it grew about mid teens in the fourth quarter and we expect to see neo2 launching in the second half so the whole basket of structural heart will be big exalt will be a meaningful new incremental revenue driver with stronger second half impact and then in pi i would say we re confident in quarterly improvements as we settled in on the btg integration and you have new products being launched from legacy btg as well as potentially ranger in the second half of 2020 which will put our position there and epu i mentioned polar x you ll see a nice impact from that particularly in the second half of the year as we ramp that up and uro continues to do well with as you mentioned augmenix which did over 100 million and is growing very very well as well as nxthera which also is doing well and we ll expect five year data shortly and new reimbursement approvals from cigna and blue cross so really across the portfolio there s a number of exciting things that s why to reinforce dan s comment despite some of the near term issues in china we re very comfortable with six and a half to eight and a half full year range operator your next question comes from the line of rick wise from stifel please go ahead rick wise stifel financial corp analyst good morning mike if we could focus if i could focus on exalt d obviously you re excited we ve had a bunch of in depth doctor conversations lately happily all of them wanted to try it and were interested so i m very interested but they highlighted usability and sort of comparability to their current reusable technology and they were all seemed uncertain about pricing and cost can you talk to us about your confidence that exalt d equals current reusable technology talk to us about pricing and how you re going to go at making the economic case to the docs and the hospitals and maybe last just talk about the manufacturing ramp and how that ties into the acceleration as you move toward full launch mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer thanks rick so the teams have as you know this has been a multiyear program built off of the capabilities we ve learned with lithovue and digital spyglass those capabilities are leveraged for exalt d and you hit the key criteria the no 1 criteria if this is to be a blockbuster product which we think it will be well to be have comparable usability and functionality as existing scopes that require the sterilization expense of processes and so that is the spec that the team has been focused on over the past three or four years and so the good news is we ve had done a number of procedures we ve had a number of key positions around the globe involved with the product for multiple years and we re quite confident in the design elements and the visualization capabilities of the product also i think we have formed with us with the fda approved device and the capabilities as a team we ll able to make improvements to the platform within each year and so just like we ve done with digital and with lithovue excited to see probably a once a year enhancement upgrade if you will to the platform and so it s not as if this is a stagnant product and which sometimes you get with the reusables for many years this is a product that we ll be able to enhance at least once per year throughout the next year period whether it be smaller handles left handed right handed different user features that the competition doesn t have so i think that cadence will allow us to please physicians and the spec is to make it as good on the manufacturing side we have a lot of experience with this we ve been investing ahead of it that s one reason why you saw the increase in our capital investment in 19 and 20 as to manage the volume that we expect so we re comfortable with the ramp that we have laid out with acceleration in the second quarter and beyond on the economics of it it s a complicated topic we do believe there s ample room in the existing reimbursement with in patient at roughly 4 000 to 12 to 11 500 and outpatient 3 000 to call it 5 000 and we re also as you know we did receive fda kind of the breakthrough status which potentially could help with additional potential reimbursement tailwinds in terms of the pricing itself we have lots of flexibility within our endo business to price it on its own or potentially look at contracting capabilities leveraging our portfolio across the business there rick wise stifel financial corp analyst thanks so much for all that mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer yep operator your next question comes from the line of vijay kumar from evercore isi please go ahead vijay kumar evercore isi analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question so mike maybe one follow up on the guidance and then i had one for dan on the guidance the comments around the cadence first half versus second half if i recollect last year you had the days impact in second half i mean i appreciate all the comments on structural heart but shouldn t structural heart cadence be similar to last year the real incremental for new products which should step up in second half is that the right way to think about rick and just on the range itself six and a half to eight and a half are you comfortable at the midpoint of the range or and i appreciate the wider range just given q4 and market factors but just want to get a sense whether you re comfortable at the midpoint dan brennan executive vice president and chief financial officer sure this is dan vijay so on the structural heart piece i think that s fair that as you look at the lotus launch that s obviously a very controlled rollout that we ve had and that should gain momentum over time as should sentinel mike mentioned that neo2 comes out in the second half so i think that s fair relative to structural heart we obviously wouldn t give a specific number within the guidance range of six and a half to eight and a half organic for the full year but as you heard in mike s commentary that our goal is to accelerate in 2020 off 2019 vijay kumar evercore isi analyst that s helpful dan and then one on the margins here dan i think i heard you mention in a china tender japan biannual price cuts what specifically is the impact from those factors on gross margin and on the operating lineup does it have any impact on the mix just given btgs coming in because it looks like you re implying 60 basis points margin expansion mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer yeah actually on that prior question from my watchman team friends here i want to make sure i include watchman flx in the us as well because that s a huge launch for the watchman team who has done a fantastic job since inception on the price impact as i look at it the summary would be we just have a little bit more price across the enterprise this year in a couple of those areas as we mentioned the biannual japan price cut and the china that will not allow the normal manufacturing cost improvements to poke their head above that and have gross margin go north the normal equation is you have your manufacturing cost improvements then you have pricing and mix and the net of those three normally has gross margin increasing this year the pricing is a little bit higher with china and japan and potentially some acceleration on the des front there as mike mentioned so that really just all netted out where margin gross margin should be in that approximately 72 range we said that s not a surprise to us it s what we ve been saying all along for the last two years is that gross margin which has paid a lot of the builds over the last five or six years would slow in terms of its ability to contribute to operating margin improvement and then sg a and r d would pick up that slack you saw that in 2019 and you should see the same thing in 2020 vijay kumar evercore isi analyst thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen from wells fargo please go ahead larry biegelsen wells fargo securities analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions guys one on complex pci one on neuromodulation so your complex pci business continues to do really well but that s a business that we don t have a lot of visibility on so my question for you mike or dan is how are you feeling about the sustainability of growth in that business in 2020 and what are the drivers and i have one follow up mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer sure that business as we ve mentioned is larger than des and continues to do very well around the globe and it s really maybe our most important business in asia pac so that strategically is a very big business for us it requires more clinical orientation which is also helpful and more in our sweet spot and also is under less pricing pressure i would say compared to drug eluting stents so the innovation there is really important and you see a big focus on our idas and rural beta platform as well as wolverine and maybe you can touch on some other key products but it s really a key cadence of new products that we have as well as the big focus on complex pci training that we have around the globe and how our portfolio matches that dan brennan executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think you ve said most of it mike i think the thing i d say larry that s most important is the population is aging and so the burden of the disease is appearing later and so we re seeing more patients with more complex due to the later age more co morbidities less suitable for surgery so just the sheer demographic change is actually driving the burden of complex current disease in late age so it requires more complex interventions larry biegelsen wells fargo securities analyst ok that s helpful and just under modulation mike and dan you gave a lot of helpful color on the different businesses for 2020 but i wasn t sure if i heard your expectations for neuromodulation for 2020 relative to 2019 so how do you see that business in 2020 relative to 2019 on an organic basis mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer sure yes we re hopeful that we aim for that business i would say to accelerate versus 19 if you look at 19 our sbs business was slow the market was slow and we had extremely difficult comps the prior year and so we would expect our global scs business to improve over 19 and 2020 and also you heard at nand as well as detail out in some of the script some of the clinical benefits we have with that portfolio so i think truly on a comp basis and expectations for the market to improve somewhat we would expect that to improve and in dbs we just have a lot of really good momentum there excellent share taking place in europe and in the us and you ll see some additional clinical studies being presented with that platform we touched on some of the product differentiation there and then you have vertiflex which will go organic in the second half of the year so we think broadly speaking neuromodul will grow faster in 20 than 19 larry biegelsen wells fargo securities analyst thanks for taking the questions guys operator your next question comes from the line of josh jennings from cowen please go ahead josh jennings cowen and company analyst hi good morning thanks and just two questions first on china i understand the nice details around the 1q potential headwind but can you help us get a little bit more granular and any help just in terms of your exposure in china by business unit i mean it s cardiovascular interventional cardiology most exposed or is it more broad based and then on the second question just watchman flx many comments today just on it being a driver can you help us understand the boost that you ll get from watchman flx launch is that premium pricing are there accounts out there that are waiting for watchman flx to get over the hump to start a watchman program or is it just deeper penetration to current accounts as watchman flx will open up kind of more procedures in different risk categories of patients dan brennan executive vice president and chief financial officer sure josh i can start on the first one and i think mike can take the second one the good news is we do have as you mentioned a very well diversified portfolio in our china business it s not reliant on one particular business within the mix but as our team reflects on all of what s going on there it s pretty clear that a vast majority of the healthcare resources in china are focused on diagnosing treating and preventing the spread of the coronavirus and that all of the procedures are at risk of being delayed so as we look at it we don t say it s one particular division or another and that 10 to 40 contemplates the whole market basket of boston scientific business and the impact that we could see here in the first quarter mike mahoney chairman and chief executive officer yeah and on watchman flx ian or dr stein can comment on it as well but i think in terms of what we ve seen in europe it s been more of a share taking capability that we have in europe and in the us we haven t seen center is not opening because we don t have watchman flx so we don t think it s going to drive the sort of new center openings that we ve been already received with current watchman i think it s and they can speak to the safety profile and the confidence that physicians have with flx which will give them more confidence to continue to increase our utilization rates which are so maybe metric for watchman broadly is utilization rates we ll continue to open some more centers in the us we re expanding in japan we re expanding in other countries but in the us it s all about turning on and continue to ramp up utilization which we re seeing or we believe watchman flx will further enhance that dan brennan executive vice president and chief financial officer i d just add to that i d say the key drivers of utilization or our awareness and we re driving that through education strategies and direct to patient direct to physician education strategies which is highly effective and then procedural enhancements actually increased utilization and watchman flx is a substantial procedural enhancement in terms of being simpler to use easier to recapture and physicians immediately recognize the procedural enhancements and the third part of increasing utilization is building evidence and i think the fact that we ve announced the champion trial a major doac versus watchman flx trial helps to build the awareness and therefore the utilization so i think things will be very positive susie lisa vice president of investor relations great with that we d like to conclude the call thanks for joining us today we appreciate your interest in bsx before you disconnect

product rationalization costs for grain and protein equipment and a higher effective tax rate warranty expense increased approximately 23 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due primarily

translation impact 3 see reconciliation of non gaap measures in appendix agco s fourth quarter results reflect the impact of challenging market conditions particularly in europe and south america stated martin richenhagen agco s chairman president and chief executive officer in addition our results were impacted by higher than anticipated new product warranty costs as well as charges associated with brand and product rationalizations within our grain and protein business despite the lower sales we made solid progress with our margin improvement efforts and delivered adjusted earnings growth and strong cash flow for the full year we remain well positioned to continue investing in premium technology smart farming solutions and enhanced digital capabilities for our customers in order to improve our global market position looking forward to 2020 we are forecasting relatively flat global market demand with further earnings improvement driven by margin development actions targeted in the areas of pricing purchasing factory productivity and new product development as we enter a new decade i am confident in our industry and agco s long term strategies to deliver growth

america 16 5 western europe 2 2 18 1 excludes compact tractors 2 based on company estimates a late harvest and lower crop production in north america were mostly offset by better production in brazil and the european union keeping grain inventories relatively high and pressuring commodity prices during 2019 continued mr richenhagen global industry retail sales of farm equipment in 2019 were lower across agco s key markets with fourth quarter industry retail sales significantly lower than the prior year in both europe and south america for the full year industry retail sales were down modestly in north america during 2019 due to a difficult growing season and concerns involving trade the usda is projecting 2020 farm income in the u s to remain challenged due to low commodity prices and uncertainty with market facilitation program payments we project north american industry tractor sales to be modestly down in 2020 compared to 2019 in western europe industry demand trended progressively lower throughout 2019 due to the impact of lower wheat and milk prices and higher input costs for dairy producers industry sales declines across most of western europe were partially offset by growth in france finland and spain for 2020 eu farm income is expected to be down modestly driven primarily by lower milk prices partially offset by more normal crop production based on these assumptions we expect sentiment to remain weak and 2020 industry demand to continue to soften modestly across the european markets industry sales in australia and new zealand were down significantly in 2019 from 2018 levels to due drought conditions and will likely remain down in 2020 fourth quarter industry retail sales in brazil did not recover as we expected resulting in a strong decline for the full year industry demand is expected to improve in brazil in 2020 brazilian farmers should benefit from a weaker real and strong crop production however uncertainty around export demand and potential changes to the subsidized financing program are likely to temper farmer sentiment our long term global view remains positive increasing demand for commodities driven by the growing world population rising emerging market protein consumption and biofuel use are expected to support elevated farm income and healthy conditions in our industry regional results agco regional

the conference call for twelve months following the call a copy of this press release will be available on agco s website for at least twelve months following the call safe harbor statement statements that are not historical facts including the projections of earnings per share sales industry demand market conditions commodity prices currency translation farm income levels margin levels investments in product and technology development new product introductions restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives production volumes tax rates and general economic conditions are forward looking and subject to risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the statements the following are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in or implied by the forward looking statements our financial results depend entirely upon the agricultural industry and factors that adversely affect the agricultural industry generally including declines in the general economy adverse weather tariffs increases in farm input costs lower commodity prices lower farm income and changes in the availability of credit for our retail customers will adversely affect us a majority of our sales and manufacturing take place outside the united states and many of our sales involve products that are manufactured in one country and sold in a different country and as a result we are exposed to risks related to foreign laws taxes and tariffs trade restrictions economic conditions labor supply and relations political conditions and governmental policies these risks may delay or reduce our realization of value from our international operations among these risks are the uncertain consequences of brexit russian sanctions and tariffs imposed on exports to and imports from china most retail sales of the products that we manufacture are financed either by our joint ventures with rabobank or by a bank or other private lender our joint ventures with rabobank which are controlled by rabobank and are dependent upon rabobank for financing as well finance over 50 of the retail sales of our tractors and combines in the markets where the joint ventures operate any difficulty by rabobank to continue to provide that financing or any business decision by rabobank as the controlling member not to fund the business or particular aspects of it for example a particular country or region would require the joint ventures to find other sources of financing which may be difficult to obtain or us to find another source of retail financing for our customers or our customers would be required to utilize other retail financing providers as a result of the recent economic downturn financing for capital equipment purchases generally has become more difficult in certain regions and in some cases can be expensive to obtain to the extent that financing is not available or available only at unattractive prices our sales would be negatively impacted both agco and our finance joint ventures have substantial accounts receivable from dealers and end customers and we would be adversely impacted if the collectability of these receivables was not consistent with historical experience this collectability is dependent upon the financial strength of the farm industry which in turn is dependent upon the general economy and commodity prices as well as several of the other factors listed in this section we have experienced substantial and sustained volatility with respect to currency exchange rate and interest rate changes which can adversely affect our reported results of operations and the competitiveness of our products our success depends on the introduction of new products particularly engines that comply with emission requirements which requires substantial expenditures our production levels and capacity constraints at our facilities including those resulting from plant expansions and systems upgrades at our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our results our expansion plans in emerging markets including establishing a greater manufacturing and marketing presence and growing our use of component suppliers could entail significant risks our business increasingly is subject to regulations relating to privacy and data protection and if we violate any of those regulations or otherwise are the victim of a cyber attack we could incur significant losses and liability we depend on suppliers for components parts and raw materials for our products and any failure by our suppliers to provide products as needed or by us to promptly address supplier issues will adversely impact our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture and sell products it remains unclear how if at all the recent outbreak of the coronavirus will impact the agricultural industry our suppliers or our global operations we are subject to raw material price fluctuations which can adversely affect our manufacturing costs we face significant competition and if we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers we would lose customers and our net sales and profitability would decline we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and as a result we are subject to certain restrictive covenants and payment obligations that may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business further information concerning these and other factors is included in agco s filings with the securities and exchange commission including its form 10 k for the year

tracking global economic uncertainty implications for global investment and trade prepared by alina bobasu andré geis lucia quaglietti and martino ricci published as part of the ecb economic bulletin issue 1 2020 this box sheds light on the role of uncertainty in the recent slowdown of global investment and trade over the past year the global economy has transitioned from a robust and synchronised expansion to a widespread slowdown global growth has weakened on the back of soft investment which was also a key driver of the sharp fall in global trade growth in the first half of 2019 see chart a the slowdown in global investment and trade has occurred in an environment of rising trade tensions between the united states and china slowing chinese demand geo political tensions brexit and idiosyncratic stresses in several emerging economies with rising uncertainty magnifying the negative impact against this backdrop this box assesses the role of uncertainty in the recent slowdown of global investment and trade chart a drivers of world imports excluding the euro area qoq change source ecb calculations notes aggregation of 18 countries representing approximatively 75 of euro area foreign demand contributions are obtained from individual countries error correction models the models relate import volumes to domestic demand components commodity prices and relative import prices according to bussière et al measures of import intensity adjusted demand iad are computed by weighting the components of domestic demand according to their import content derived from global input output tables in order to capture long term factors such as shifts in non price competitiveness or changes in trade openness non linear deterministic trends are also included in the long run relationships the long term coefficient of the elasticity of imports to domestic demand is restricted to one since uncertainty cannot be observed directly proxies are generally used economic uncertainty can stem from different sources and is characterised by a situation in which agents cannot contemplate all the possible states of nature or characterise their probability distributions while the literature goes some way towards defining the concept of uncertainty including by setting it apart from risk and confidence there is no single commonly accepted measure of uncertainty several proxies have been proposed such as indicators based on stock market volatility counts of the word uncertainty in newspaper articles and measures based on disagreement between professional forecasters in this box we present synthetic measures of time varying macroeconomic uncertainty jurado et al define economic uncertainty as the conditional volatility of a disturbance that is unforecastable from the perspective of economic agents with an increase in uncertainty generally being associated with a growing difficulty of predicting future economic outcomes based on this definition we developed measures of economic uncertainty for 16 euro area trading partners together accounting for around 70 of world gdp excluding the euro area the measures were derived from the time varying volatility of model based forecast errors of a broad selection of macroeconomic and financial market time series applying the same approach to a large selection of country trade indicators we also derived a measure of global trade uncertainty the estimation results suggest that while global economic uncertainty has increased gradually over the past year global trade uncertainty has surged more rapidly trade related uncertainty has risen by some two standard deviations over the past year more than twice the increase observed in economic uncertainty see chart b while our measures line up reassuringly well with past political geopolitical and economic events generally associated with high uncertainty the recent intensification coincides with various tariff announcements made by the united states and china for instance the trade uncertainty indicator started rising in mid 2018 when us tariffs on steel and aluminium were announced and spiked again in the first quarter of 2019 after the united states increased tariffs on usd 200 billion of imports from china all countries in the sample except switzerland have experienced an increase in uncertainty since early 2018 chart b global economic and trade uncertainty standard deviation from mean source ecb calculations note standard deviations from means are computed over the period jan 1998 august 2019 following the global financial crisis policy debates have increasingly focused on the macroeconomic consequences of heightened uncertainty recent ecb analysis suggests that rising uncertainty had negative effects on euro area investment during the global financial and euro area sovereign debt crises an often cited channel linking uncertainty to real activity is the irreversibility of investment moreover the interplay between uncertainty shocks and financial frictions can have powerful effects on economic activity consumers may also react to increased uncertainty by raising their precautionary savings economic uncertainty also appears to play an important role at the current juncture analysing the causal relationship between fluctuations in uncertainty and output growth is not straightforward as causality can be bi directional higher uncertainty affects economic activity but adverse shocks to output are also likely to raise uncertainty in order to distinguish exogenous shocks from uncertainty we rely on the methodology proposed by piffer and podstawski and estimate a proxy structural vector autoregression svar in which we use variations in the price of gold as an instrument for uncertainty the results of this analysis suggest that uncertainty shocks matter and are significant in size on impact a one standard deviation uncertainty shock subtracts around 0 4 p p from growth in global investment and 0 8 p p from global imports respectively see chart c our analysis also suggests that uncertainty has been a drag on global investment and trade growth over the past year accounting for a third of the decline in investment and for 40 of the decline in global imports see chart d chart c impulse response of world investment lhs and world imports rhs excluding the euro area to a one standard deviation uncertainty shock y axis percentage points x axis quarters source ecb calculations notes the chart shows impulse response functions obtained from an svar model featuring our measure of global economic uncertainty global investment global imports an aggregate measure of interest rates global cpi inflation and an index of world equity prices the model is estimated over the period 1996q1 to 2019q2 global aggregates of the variables included in the var are constructed from 16 countries accounting for 75 of world gdp using gdp ppp weights the blue lines show the pointwise medians while the grey areas show the 68 confidence intervals chart d decomposition of world investment growth and world imports growth excluding the euro area quarterly average percentage change between 2017q2 2018q2 and 2018q2 2019q2 deviation from trend source ecb calculations a dissipation of uncertainty may also contribute to the pickup in global activity as anticipated by the december 2019 eurosystem macroeconomic projections with the headwinds clouding the global economy slowly fading and uncertainty receding a modest recovery of global activity and trade is expected in the medium term growth supportive policies across many economies are expected to provide additional relief however many of the events that have spurred the rise in uncertainty are far from being resolved and risks to global economic activity are judged to be tilted to the downside therefore uncertainty could continue to cloud the global outlook in the coming quarters
anthea jeffery i have heard it said many times by people the world that what has happened to venezuela could never happen to them and that s exactly what we in venezuela also said some 20 years ago that it could never happen to us because venezuela was a vibrant society with institutions resources and a well educated middle class and it was close to the usa and look where we are now over 30m venezuelans cannot believe how horrible how terrible the destruction and devastation have been there are no indicators no numbers not even images that can convey the degree of the pain that venezuela is going through so don t think it can t happen to you this in essence was the message that maria corina machado a venezuelan opposition mp and presidential candidate in 2012 had for south africans at a conference on property rights organised by the free market foundation in johannesburg in november 2018 this conference took place a week after parliament s constitutional review committee crc had recommended that section 25 of the bill of rights should be amended to allow expropriation without compensation ewc ostensibly this amendment is supposed to speed up land reform and turn it in some way yet to be explained from failure to success the real motive however as cosatu described it in 2018 is to give the state control over all land in the country and so cripple the free market economy the crc s 2018 recommendation has now given rise to the draft constitution eighteenth amendment bill of 2019 this bill provides that nil compensation may at times be paid on the expropriation of both land and all improvements on it the bill also empowers parliament to adopt by simple 51 majority any number of new laws setting out the specific instances in which nil compensation should apply ms machado s message which had to be sent by video recording to johannesburg as she had long been prohibited from leaving venezuela and was under close surveillance by its security forces is just as salient to south africa today as it was some 15 months ago the ewc process in oil rich venezuela started small with a constitutional amendment that seemed to target only large and idle estates or latifundios these latifundios had to be broken up said president hugo chavez to allow peasants to gain ownership of the land they cultivated before long however ewc had spread to some 20 of total farming land while production of maize rice sorghum and other crops had dropped by 40 in general and often more shortfalls were initially made up by using venezuela s oil wealth to import food after 2014 however when the oil price decreased dramatically imports of all essentials including food became far more difficult for the government to afford the resulting food shortages were blamed on hoarding and rationing was introduced price controls were also tightened up forcing farmers to sell at prices below production costs and curtailing supply still further food riots began in 2016 as did the hijacking of food trucks and the violent looting of stores president nicolas maduro who had taken over in 2013 on the death of his predecessor began urging the 80 urbanised population to start growing food and raising chickens at home often people were expected to achieve this on balconies and roof tops moreover despite all assurances to the contrary ewc in venezuela did not stop at farming land instead it soon spread to oil companies mines banks factories and other enterprises the economic consequences were catastrophic before it embarked on 21st century socialism venezuela had been the richest country in latin america between 2012 and 2019 however its gdp halved while public debt expanded rapidly soon hyperinflation rose to more than 2 million percent a year savings were wiped out unemployment and poverty soared food medicines and electricity became ever scarcer and more than 3 million venezuelans roughly 10 of the population fled to neighbouring states many families as ms machado notes now have to survive on us 5 to 10 a month and often on less a similar story is evident in zimbabwe where the farm confiscations that began in 2000 soon triggered a far broader economic implosion once the property rights of a small group of white farmers had been destroyed business confidence fell sharply so too did investment growth employment production and tax revenues prompting millions to flee the government started printing money to sustain its spending this triggered hyperinflation at a globally unprecedented rate of 89 7 sextillion percent within eight years some 20 years later food water electricity and fuel remain in critically short supply unemployment is sky high at roughly 90 even civil servants earn less than us 1 90 a day putting them below the extreme poverty line now that the zimbabwean dollar zollar is back the inflation rate has already sped up above 500 in what could prove to be a devastating replay of the past experience in venezuela and zimbabwe should provide a salutary warning to all those in the upper echelons of the anc who may believe that ewc will work well for them that their proven party loyalties will give them preferential access to confiscated land houses farms or factories and add to their existing wealth instead many of these cadres could find themselves engulfed by the crippling consequences of ewc the impact will be even worse if the government responds to falling revenue and rising debt by raiding pension funds and printing money which is sure to send inflation soaring in time millions of well paid public servants could find like their counterparts in venezuela and zimbabwe that their earnings have dropped to us 2 a day or even less this would be a far cry from the monthly salaries they now enjoy for the rest of the middle class to say nothing of the already jobless and destitute the suffering would be even more acute moreover unlike in venezuela and zimbabwe there would be nowhere else for unskilled and desperate south africans to go public comment on the constitution eighteenth amendment bill has been extended by a month until 29 february 2020 millions of south africans both in and outside the anc must use this extra time to voice their vehement objections to this ewc amendment there is simply no room for complacency nor for the unfounded belief that it can never happen to us if

refinanced our primary credit agreement in january 2020 following expected post closing perfection actions liquidity under the new facility is expected to be over 100 million outlook the company s baseline assumptions for 2020 include slow growth in industry wide truckload shipments a continued reduction of total truckload capacity from the market which is expected to drive an inflection in pricing later in the year and relatively benign cost inflation the first quarter is generally our weakest quarter of the year as we experience lower revenue per tractor and higher costs than the other quarters due to seasonal freight fluctuations and harsher operating conditions while we see positive trends in certain areas there continues to be uncertainty in the short term environment which will impact the actual sequential margin deterioration in the first quarter we continue to believe that market conditions will improve in the back half 2020 the timing and magnitude of market changes will have a significant impact on our quarterly results given our substantial operating leverage conference call the company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter results at 8 30 a m

the board chief executive officer thank you michael and good morning everyone fmc s strong financial performance continued in the fourth quarter capping an excellent year for the company our performance was marked by volume growth across all regions and once again highlighted the benefit of a balanced geographic exposure the strength of our portfolio and the impact of new product launches turning to slide three fmc reported 1 2 billion in fourth quarter revenue which reflect the year over year increase or 9 on a reported basis in 11 organic growth excluding fx headwinds this increase was given by double digit organic growth in argentina canada france russia india china indonesia and pakistan as well as price increases across all regions except north america adjusted company ebitda was 320 million an increase of 17 compared to the prior year period and at the top end of our guidance company ebitda margins were about 27 up 180 basis points year over year despite 28 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs tariffs and fx in the quarter adjusted eps was 1 76 in the quarter an increase of 21 versus recast q4 2018 the year over year performance was driven largely by a 0 34 increase on the ebitda line and the benefit of reduced share count partially offset by higher interest expenses compared to a most recent guidance adjusted eps was also much higher due to very strong operational performance as higher volume and solid cost control drove 0 07 outperformance versus guidance where the much lower than forecasted tax rate in the quarter resulted in 0 21 of the beat versus guidance moving now to slide four q4 revenue grew by 7 versus prior year with volume contributing 11 growth offset partially by a 2 headwind from fx overall price was flat as increased rebates in north america offset strong pricing in the other three regions given the start of the southern hemisphere season latin america made up over 40 over fourth quarter revenue sales in latin america grew 10 year over year or 13 organically driven by very strong growth in argentina and single digit growth in brazil and mexico argentina posted significantly higher volumes for a preemergent herbicides and soybean we are very pleased with these results in argentina as you may recall we talked about the significant changes we made to improve our market access in argentina which are now delivering on our expectations as forecasted following four quarters of very strong double digit growth brazil growth slowed in q4 but continued to deliver increased volume channel inventories of our product in brazil remain at normal levels for this point of the season and are well under control heading into 2020 in north america revenue increased 10 year over year driven by strong demand for rynaxypyr insect control in specialty crops growth of ethos xb a combination insecticide and fungicide for in furrow applications and our new lucento fungicide herbicide sales in canada were also strong our overall volume was above what was expected in the quarter resulting in higher than forecasted rebates these rebates are accounted for in our pricing line which offset price increases in other regions we continue to closely monitor channel inventories of our products in the u s as we head into the spring to ensure a reduction of those channel inventories on a year over year basis we proactively sold less of authority preemergent herbicide into the channel in the second half of 2019 than we did in the same period in 2018 in asia we had a very strong fourth quarter performance with a revenue increase of 9 and 10 organic growth year over year in an otherwise down market india china indonesia and pakistan all recorded double digit growth rates driven by insecticide volumes following a very strong q2 and q3 india delivered over 20 revenue growth in q4 driven by rice and sugarcane applications and new product launches china s strong revenue growth was driven by diamide demand and fungicide sales in citrus and vegetable applications in emea sales grew 5 overall as france u k russia italy and romania all posted double digit year over year growth q4 organic growth in the region was 7 and was driven largely by sales in france and russia which more than offset difficult drought conditions that impacted cereal plantings in central and eastern europe turning to the fourth quarter ebitda bridge on slide five you see a 75 million volume contribution which came from all regions and which drove the year over year growth relative to again both volume and cost management led to the strong outperformance on slide six full year revenue was 4 6 billion an increase of 8 compared to the prior year excluding fx headwinds of 3 this represents 11 organic growth full year adjusted eps increased 0 85 year over year or 16 driven by ebitda growth and the benefit of share repurchases on slide seven you can see that fmc growth for 2019 we re well ahead of the crop protection market in every region these percentages shown are all in u s dollar terms despite the extreme weather and trade challenges in the year our full year sales in north america were up 3 which was ahead of forecast and 900 basis points ahead of the market fmc full year sales in latin america grew 19 600 basis points ahead of the market and 23 organically in emea the sales grew 4 in the year which was 700 basis points ahead of the market and 10 organically fmc revenue growth in asia was 3 on a reported basis 800 basis points ahead of the market and 8 organically excluding fx headwinds across many currencies globally fmc grew 8 in 2019 in u s dollar terms versus a flatglobal market we believe our outperformance in every region was due to the strength of our portfolio a crop balance and a strong commercial presence around the world moving to slide eight where you can see our full ebitda and revenue drivers volume was the main driver of revenue growth while price increased sales by 3 almost 20 of this year s revenue growth came from 2019 product launches and our vitality index which we calculate as the proportion of total revenue coming from products introduced in the last five years was roughly 10 of total sales the diamide grew in the low teens in 2019 and the rest of the portfolio grew in the mid single digits on our q2earnings call we outlined our plans to profitably grow our diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents and all the way through the end of this decade via the engagement of third parties we indicated we are in place or negotiating 15 such commercial agreements six months later we have expanded the number of agreements to cover four global partnerships and 41 separate local company agreements covering 11 countries a number of these new agreements are active and commercial sales are occurring we will continue to expand the franchise through more of these commercial agreements these partnerships are important and in most cases allow us to access markets we are not selling into today they are a key extension of our commercial reach 2019 adjusted ebitda of 1 22 billion was up 10 year over year despite 228 million in combined headwinds from higher cost and fx revenue and the ebitda growth rate in 2019 are both above the high end of the five year growth targets we provided in december 2018 i will now turn it over to andrew andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks pierre i ll start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement then move to the balance sheet cash flow and share count i ll also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new sap s 4hana system interest expense for full year 2019 was 158 5 million 3 5 million above our most recent guidance primarily due to higher than forecasted foreign debt and commercial paper balances for 2020 we anticipate interest expense between 160 million and 170 million with the increase largely attributable to higher foreign debt balances particularly where we utilize local borrowings to reduce currency exposures our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the full year 2019 was 11 6 290 basis points lower than anticipated fmc s corporate structure particularly the principal operating companies that were created as part of the dupont transaction in 2017 provide fmc with structurally low tax rate with this structure profit outside the united states is taxed at lower statutory or negotiated tax rates than profit in the u s resulting in a weighted average tax rate well below the u s statutory rate to be clear even at this lower overall rate fmc does incur a significant amount of us tax on these non us profits under the global intangible low tax income or guilty for the structural elements that drive our low overall effective tax rate or highly sustainable and we expect a low rate for many years to come however the effective tax rate in any period is sensitive to swings and profitability between geographies most notably the amount of profit earned in the us the significant contributors to our lower than expected tax rate in 2019 were lower than forecasted earnings in the u s due to the factors in our north america business pierre mentioned earlier combined with stronger than forecasted earnings that flowed through our principal operating companies outside of the u s looking ahead to 2020 we expect a full year tax rate of 12 5 to 14 5 based on our current estimates of taxable earnings by geography at year end gross debt was 3 3 billion down roughly 300 million from the end of the third quarter surplus cash on the balance sheet at year end was in excess of 225 million due to timing of receipt of end of year payments which prevented us from using this cash to further pay down debt prior to year end considering the surplus cash at year end gross debt to trailing 12 month ebitda was just under our 2 5x target we remain committed to solid investment grade credit metrics and expect full year average leverage to be in line with this commitment in 2020 moving to slide nine and cash flow free cash flow for 2020 was 302 million up 172 million from the prior year higher adjusted cash from operations driven by higher ebitda and lower use of cash for working capital and lower legacy and transformation spending more than offset an increase in capital additions compared to the prior year we are pleased with the improvements made in trade working capital trade working capital as a percentage of sales at year end decreased 210 basis points to 32 5 in 2019 free cash conversion relative to adjusted net earnings was 38 for full year 2019 more than twice the prior year on a like for like basis with free cash flow growing 10x as fast as earnings however free cash flow came in below the low end of our outlook range of 375 million to 475 million two factors largely contributed to this the first was much slower than expected collection of refunds of value added and similar taxes especially in india the delays were driven primarily by the complexities of operating in multiple sap and non sap systems around the world the second factor was delayed collections in pakistan and indonesia where weather conditions impacted grower liquidity late in the fourth quarter both factors are execution related and will reverse we fully expect to collect this cash in 2020 in the absence of these two factors our free cash flow for 2019 would have been solidly in our guidance range with free cash conversion of roughly 50 on higher than guided earnings we know we have more to do to continue to improve free cash flow moving to a single instance of sap s 4hana this year will give us a different level of visibility across our entire business and will provide us with state of the art tools to continue to drive improvement in working capital and cash flow looking ahead to 2020 we re forecasting free cash flow of 425 million to 525 million with free cash conversion from adjusted earnings of 55 at the midpoint of our guidance ranges we continue to believe we can drive free cash conversion substantially higher over the coming two to three years as we finalize our sap implementation ending the period of high cash spending on transformation activity and as we drive further improvement in working capital performance we repurchased over 4 7 million fmc shares in 2019 at an average price of 84 73 this included 100 million in repurchases completed in the fourth quarter for a total of 400 million of repurchases in the year considering the 210 million paid in dividends fmc returned over 600 million in cash to shareholders in 2019 we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders consistent with our long range plan further evidence of this commitment is the 10 increase in our quarterly cash dividend announced in december we intend to purchase between 400 million and 500 million of fmc shares in 2020 in light of the seasonal working capital build in the first quarter and ongoing product line acquisition discussions we do not expect to make any meaningful share repurchases in the first quarter but fully intend to remain a regular purchaser of shares through the rest of the year before turning the call over to mark let me also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new sap s 4hana erp system we successfully closed full year 2019 with roughly 20 of the company on the new system and are already seeing many benefits today we are going live across the acquired business which represents roughly 40 of fmc this will allow us to exit the transition services agreement at the end of this month delivering annual cost savings of 20 million which were incorporated in our earnings guidance for 2020 and with that i ll turn the call over to mark mark a douglas president and ceo elect thank you andrew moving to slide 10 and the review of our full year 2020 and q1 earnings outlook we expect full year adjusted earnings of 6 45 to 6 70 per diluted share representing an 8 increase at the midpoint this outlook for eps does not include the impact of share repurchases in 2020 revenue is expected to be in the range of 4 8 billion to 4 95 billion representing 6 growth at the midpoint and 7 organic growth compared to 2019 total company adjusted ebitda is forecasted to be in the range of 1 3 billion to 1 34 billion reflecting 8 year over year growth at the midpoint looking at the first quarter we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 1 76 to 1 86 representing an increase of 5 at the midpoint versus q1 2019 and assuming a share count of approximately 131 million we forecast q1 revenue to be in the range of 1 23 billion to 1 27 billion representing 5 growth at the midpoint compared to the first quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda is forecasted to be in the range of 346 million to 366 million representing a 4 increase at the midpoint versus the prior year period turning now to our 2020 ebitda bridge on slide 11 our ebitda growth is expected to be driven by volume gains and continued price increases we should note that we are also expecting to invest about 40 million more on r d in 2020 this increase is driven by our continued success in moving molecules into development from discovery in 2019 total r d spend should be approximately 7 of sales versus 6 5 of sales in 2019 as we continue to expand and progress 22 new active ingredients and eight new biologicals toward commercialization tariffs will be higher in 2020 while raw material costs will not materially improve until the second half of 2020 we will realize about 20 million in annual savings as we exit the transition service agreement this month foreign exchange is also forecasted to be a headwind in 2020 as the u s dollar has further strengthened versus key currencies however if you exclude the incremental 40 million in r d spend our price increases will cover over 100 of the combined headwinds from cost and fx i would also like to highlight our revenue drivers we forecast 2020 revenue growth of 6 overall and 7 organically volume is expected to contribute 5 to growth including about 1 5 from new products launched in 2020 and pricing is expected to contribute 2 growth these are slightly offset by a 1 headwind from foreign exchange one aspect of our portfolio management that we do not often highlight is the change in the makeup of our portfolio as is the case every year in 2020 we will have an adverse impact from lost registrations on molecules as well as decisions to exit some product lines this typically represents a drag of about 2 of our revenues and yet in 2019 we still grew volume 8 these portfolio impacts are factored into our long term revenue growth targets our long term product strategy of investing in an increasingly sustainable product portfolio requires that we continually replace older chemistries with newer more sustainable technologies as part of this effort as of the end of year 2019 fmc has stopped selling all carbofuran formulations including furadan insecticide globally moving to slide 12 where we will provide the key drivers for ebitda and revenue growth in the first quarter first quarter performance will be driven by strong volume growth including new product launches which are expected to deliver about 1 3 of our total revenue growth in the quarter these launches include authority edge preemergent herbicides for soybeans in the u s and battle delta herbicide for cereals in europe pricing actions are expected to fully offset the fx headwinds at the revenue level shifting to the global crop protection market we project the total market will grow in the low single digits in 2020 on a u s dollar basis with each region also growing by low single digits we forecast that asia will have the highest growth rate assuming a partial rebound in australia and more normalized weather conditions across the region in north america growth is expected to come from recovery in acreage for row crops offset by a higher than normal channel inventory levels heading into the year in latin america growth in soybeans and corn are expected to lead the crop protection market in brazil in emea growth will be driven by spring cereal herbicides following the challenging winter cereal seeding i will now turn the call back to pierre pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer thank you mark our company s outperformance in 2019 was the result of a very flexible and agile supply chain limiting the impact of raw material shortages and the delivery of market driven technologies that offer exceptional value to growers around the world we strongly believe that our investment in our discovery and development pipeline will continue to fuel long term growth for the company in 2020 we will continue to effectively navigate through unexpected challenges that arise such as weather or macroeconomic developments and we ll deliver on the financial targets we set out for you today we believe 2020 will mark the third year in a row that fmc significantly outperforms the crop protection market in terms of revenue growth and ebitda margins we expect our outperformance will be driven by broad based geographic growth launches of new products and technologies and the continued expansion of diamide franchise as we gain more registration in labels as well as grow via commercial partnerships i will now turn the call back to the operator for questions thank you very much for your attention questions and answers operator and our first question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs your line is open adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst hi good morning how are you andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst hi i was hoping to maybe to dig into the guidance details a little bit and just think through the cost side and you gave some color in the prepared remarks about r d about investments in r d and raw materials but maybe just a little bit more color around the moving pieces there andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i think if we look at the full year guidance we see it in many ways a pattern similar to what we saw last year but with a less pronounced headwind from cost and fx on the cost side you re exactly right we are we have called out we re increasing our investment in r d about 40 million year on year so of that 61 million that you see in cost increase for the full year on our bridge on slide 11 about 40 million of that is cost increase from r d spending if you remove that we really do have we start to see the benefit of the pricing actions we ve taken over the past five quarters where price and mix ends up covering more than the cost and fx headwinds i do think we did see continued higher raw material costs and tight conditions going into the second half of last year that as you know as they flow through our inventory in the first half of this year will continue to be a bit of a headwind and the u s dollar continues to strengthen against a number of our key currencies so we do still have some fx headwinds i will note that those headwinds are particularly heavy in the first half as we start looking toward the second half we start seeing much more favorable comparisons on cost and lessening fx impacts pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer on the volume front to talk about growth in mount champion but roughly three big buckets i would say of diamide we do believe it s going to be broad based geographical growth and it s going to be in the low teens think about the rest of our portfolio non diamide as in 2019 growing at about 5 and as in 19 we believe the products we will be launching in 2020 will also bring about 2 growth rate adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay that s very helpful color and then just quickly on the cash flow conversion guidance of 55 just apart from the continued investments in erp and transformation i mean what else would it take to get to that medium term target of 70 as we think 20 versus 21 and 22 pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer yes let me let s do one thing let me just take a bit the trends from 18 all the way to 21 at a high level and then maybe andrew you can go into more detail into the 2019 2020 number if you look back at 2018 we had a conversion rate of 18 in 2019 we generated 300 million of free cash flow which represents a conversion rate of 37 now this 300 million normalized should have been 400 million we had 100 million miss purely execution got our eyes off the ball on a couple of issues but the normalized number would have been around 400 million which should have been about a 50 conversion rate looking into 2020 2020 i would characterize as a year a bit along the same line as 2019 we believe we re going to benefit from higher ebitda about 8 growth but from the cost standpoint we were expecting about a year ago to be able to finish sap implementation in the first quarter of 2020 but there is no way around it it s a three year program it s going to cost 250 million so we re going to have to go all the way to the end of 2020 with sap implementation costs so we re going to have the same transformational cost as we did in 2019 so we believe 2020 will be a conversion rate of about 55 now you move into 2021 and that s when you still see if we go along the line of a five year plan another 8 ebitda increase but that s when the sap implementation transformation cost start to significantly lower and that s when just through this effect we expect to be around 70 cash conversion from adjusted earnings so that s directionally how we re going to go from 37 in 2019 to about 70 in 2021 maybe andrew you want to talk a bit more about 19 and 20 andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer sure let me talk get a little more specific on that bridge from 19 to 20 i think as pierre referenced we have about 300 million in free cash flow in 19 we re guiding an increase in ebitda of about 100 million but we ll also be increasing the spending on capex about 10 million year on year and our legacy and transformation costs increased about 20 million year on year so the combination of those factors are leave you at about 370 million the net impact of the reversal of the two factors we called out in the cash flow shortfall this quarter and the impact of change in working capital in 2020 are the rest of the difference to the rest of our guidance range it gets you up in that 425 million to 575 million so it s important in that 2020 walk as pierre mentioned we do not see a step down we actually see a slight increase in legacy and transformation year on year with about 100 million to 125 million of that being really transformation activity and the remainder being legacy expenses that basically transformation being flat to slightly down to prior year in total with legacy going up slightly so again that next real big step in cash conversion we get to a more normalized level this year for how we re operating on working capital and then in 2021 we see the step down from the end of the sap program in the end of the transformation spend operator the next question comes from the line of p j juvekar with citi your line is open p j juvekar citi analyst rebates in north america is that mostly rebates to retailers based on volumes like a volume rebate or is that more of a comparative action and in what products is that occurring thank you pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer yes p j it s just a normal it s a normal process which happens every year we do the same thing we have rebates which are indexed on volume and that s a normal process there was no specific change in the rates or anything of that kind it was just a normal year the only difference looking at the weather condition and the pattern in north america we ended up a bit stronger in the fourth quarter than we were expecting so when we had to look at all of the reserves and rebates we would have to pay we ended up having higher rebate to be paid to our customers for the full year and to be done in the fourth quarter so it s just we got a little bit surprised by the strength of the market in the fourth quarter versus what we were expecting and that because it s purely proportional to volume created a step up in rebates we re not expecting operator and the next question comes from the line of christopher parkinson with credit suisse your line is open christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you so you ve done a solid job of evolving the portfolio from both the geographic and crop perspective which i guess is kind of the key to enabling you to outgrow cpc markets however you re still underweight fungicides and kind of overweight insecticides it seems like you re entering a lot of agreements regarding texturing and the diamides over the long term but how should we think about your total portfolio evolution as it pertains to further establishing your presence in fungicides and is it a coincidence that you mentioned product line acquisition discussions in m a mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes chris you re absolutely right we are heavyweight in insecticides i believe we re the world s leader in insecticides so we re not disappointed with that profile at all however you re right we do want to increase our participation in fungicides and really we re doing that in three ways first of all is our current portfolio which is limited but with very very interesting products we launched a new product this year or 2019 lucento in north america it s going extremely well to be frank i think if we d have had more capacity we d have been able to sell more so there is the notion of selling what we have today second to that is what we have in our pipeline when you think about our discovery and development pipeline we currently have today five new fungicides in our pipeline three of which have brand new modes of action not seen before so we know we have the long term view which is very strong from the fungicide perspective closer to home we will be launching in 2021 a brand new fungicide called fluindapyr we ll be launching that around the world that will also add to the growth rate as we go through sort of the second half of our plan and then third is how we acquire technologies or access to products around the world we are under active discussions and in fact some of the agreements that we have in place today for the diamides allow us access to various fungicides in different markets so we re pursuing pretty much every avenue we know to really grow that fungicides as fast as possible but it is a target for us operator your next question comes from the line of mark connelly with stephens inc your line is open mark connelly stephens inc analyst thanks so pierre last quarter you talked about cyazypyr and the pickup we saw there cyazypyr has been a sort of a slow and steady success since the dupont days are you seeing that continue and if it is what does that say about the acceleration in demand coming this late into growth cycle mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes mark you re right cyazypyr was launched later than rynaxypyr it is i would say it is somewhat more of a difficult sell as we ve got our hands around the products we understand that it has some attributes when it comes to the performance but also has plant health benefits in terms of how a plant responds to cyazypyr and how cyazypyr removes the pests we ve talked about the size of our business in diamides over 2019 it s about a 1 6 billion business cyazypyr is growing rapidly much faster than rynaxypyr and is in the 350 million to 400 million range going forward so it s already become a significant molecule we don t believe at this point that its growth profile is slowing down certainly not in the near term so you can expect us to talk more about cyazypyr and especially the growth rates as we go forward operator your next question comes from the line of frank mitsch from fermium research your line is open frank mitsch fermium research analyst good morning and congratulations mark on being named ceo elect mark a douglas president and ceo elect thank you frank mitsch fermium research analyst and likewise pierre executive chair and i assume taking a little bit more time off but congratulations to you both pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer thank you frank mitsch fermium research analyst pierre you mentioned that over the past six months you ve been signing multiple new partnerships and i m just curious if you could kind of describe them in a little more detail i mean what products are these covering are these just covering the diamides geographic any more color that you could expand upon this and then perhaps just give us a sense as to what size of your total revenues you think this may grow to over the next couple of years pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i ll ask mark to jump in the only thing frank i want to say before mark talk a little bit is with most of these agreements we do have secrecy agreements so we are very limited to what we can say around volume especially being in an early stage it would be quite easy to understand who is doing what so and as we said in the script four are global agreements and 41 are local agreements all of them our diamides agreements mark do you want to say a few things that they cover mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes frank they cover both rynaxypyr and cyazypyr as pierre said we are under pretty tight confidentiality rules here but suffice to say 11 different countries so far all major crops and more importantly some crops and markets that we are not active in today with the diamides so think of it in terms of growth from a market access perspective in various countries around the world and these are not products that are just straight rynaxypyr or cyazypyr they are mixtures and sophisticated formulations with active ingredients that we don t have access to so the fundamental purpose here is not only to defend our franchise and grow it over the next decade but also to expand the pool of where we operate think about it this way the insecticide market is about a 15 billion market a lot of the older chemistries are going away and we have about 1 6 billion worth of business with the diamides we have plenty of room to grow here over the long haul and that is the purpose of what we re doing pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer i think what mark said is at the end is very important we do believe those partnerships are going to help us expanding the market penetration of cyazypyr and rynaxypyr those two molecules are big but we believe they are far from being at the end of their market penetration so that s one of the way to do it to complement all of the marketing and commercial activity fmc has directly operator and your next question comes from the line of laurent favre with exane please go ahead laurent favre exane analyst yes good morning i ve got a question on the step up in r d from 6 5 to 7 of sales i was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about what s driving the increase is it underlying cost inflation against the existing plan is it spending more on discovery of i guess new actives is it changing scope on the formulations or is it just a bit of everything mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes laurent really the 40 million is targeted at two new active ingredients that we moved into development from discovery in 2019 so we now have that run rate cost of spending more money on what is really the most expensive part of the whole r d cycle which is development it s where we spend a lot of money on toxicology etc so those products are now moving into a phase where for the next three four five years spending will be increased 7 of revenue is not something that we see as a problem for us we actually have phased our r d so that we should be in that 7 range on an ongoing basis you should expect to see that number change as we go through the years and the business continues to grow we will be spending more on r d as we continue to expand not only the pipeline of synthetics but biologicals as well operator your next question comes from the line of steve byrne from bank of america your line is open steve byrne bank of america analyst yes i was hoping you could comment on whether or not you re seeing any indications of some competitive pricing from any one of the following buckets one being the inventory the channel inventory levels mark that you mentioned in north america being higher than normal another potential one would be the big seed companies are increasingly bundling crop chems with their seed platforms another one being increased e commerce offerings anything that you re seeing there that if you could comment on those please pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer thank you listen first of all we should know it s a highly competitive market there is lots of companies in this market we are competing but at the end of the day it is a market we are offering and technology matter so yes there is competitive actions but at the end of the day if you price right the right technology you can protect your margin maybe mark let s start the comment about seeds and bundling and maybe talk about the meeting you and i we had last week with our customers mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes sure so let s put it in perspective you re talking about seed bundling you re really talking about major row crops in the midwest of the u s and frankly when you look at that as an overall component of our business it s not the majority of our business by a long way and even in the u s we have tremendous exposure outside of the midwest we don t see the bundling aspect as a competitive threat to us the meeting pierre was referencing pierre and i and the whole of the north america commercial team we were with 250 retailers and distribution companies in the u s last week and we spent three to four days talking about the market where are we what s our competitive offering and i can tell you no time did we hear that the combination of seeds and chemicals is a detriment to our growth in fact we heard the opposite we heard the fact that our offerings are offering technology on anybody seeds it doesn t matter whose seeds you buy can be an independent can be oneof the big two or three so for us we see this as an extreme positive and so do our retailers and so do our distribution partners so in that sense no i don t see the seeds combination has been an issue for us on the last bucket that you had steve on e commerce we actually see e commerce as having a place in the marketplace but frankly we see it at the low end of the market it s easy to sell a generic on price it s not easy to sell a very sophisticated preemergent herbicide or very sophisticated diamide insecticide online we don t participate in those forums we will not participate in those forums our customers are the people that are offering the service levels down on the ground with the growers so for us we re not seeing anything impacting our overall north america business through e commerce pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer i want to repeat what mark said because that is very critical and it is a strategic decision of fmc we will not get into the seed business we do not need to be in the seed business when mark talked about 200 customers it is true it was 200 to 250 customers with whom we spent most of the week i can tell you that to a person they told that it s very critical to have a chemical and biological supplier who is agnostic to the type of seeds and somebody has the right technology they can use with any type of seed our customers are not big fans of bundling or being pushed to use a specific seed with a specific chemical they need the freedom to choose and we provide that to them so it is not something we are concerned about we do believe i would even go one step beyond i think it s a competitive advantage for us to not be in seeds operator your next question comes from the line of mike sison with wells fargo your line is open mike sison wells fargo analyst hey guys nice end to the year and congrats to you both mark a douglas president and ceo elect thank you pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer thanks mike mike sison wells fargo analyst i think you mentioned the non diamides business is expected to be up mid single digits in 2020 can you maybe give us a little bit of color where the growth is coming from new molecules new geographies new registrations i m sure it s a little bit of all of the above but just a little bit of help there mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes mike it is a little bit of all the above as pierre indicated our legacy portfolio we believe is growing in roughly the mid single digits i would say across the board we ve seen the highest growth rates with the fungicide portfolio that we have spent a lot of time on growing that around the world mainly in north america certainly the legacy insecticide portfolio is doing extremely well especially in latin america where we have some very very good products that are going into the soy complex and then we would come to the herbicides where we see growth in both the u s with some pretty sophisticated preemergent formulations like authority edge that are replacing current technologies that are out there we see growth in argentina on preemergence and we also see significant continued growth with herbicides in sugarcane in brazil moving over to asia india is a big market for us now and we re offering brand new herbicide formulations that have not been seen before in india especially for sugarcane we continue to grow our rice herbicide business in china so all those pieces that come together you can see it s quite easy for us to get into that mid single digit range operator your next question comes from the line of don carson with susquehanna financial your line is open don carson susquehanna financial analyst thank you i want to go back to raw material costs and your outlook for the year pierre you mentioned that the higher cost last year will flow through inventory in the first half but once you get through that as you get into the second half do you see raw material costs coming down and i know you ve recast your supply chain but is availability out of china a problem now that s perhaps grown with some of the recent shutdowns could that have a second half effect on the industry pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer yes so first of all let me start with the cost as we are forecasting in our guidance you are correct the cost is turning into the second half of the year into positive which means that most of the adverse cost in our p l is happening in the first half of the year with a disproportionate amount in the first quarter and then in the second quarter so and then when we get into the second half that s when these costs are improving from an availability standpoint where are we today as you can guess the issues we had last year which were due to environmental issues and industrial parks shutting down those issues are over i think we are not suffering from any issues there the thing we are watching of course is the impact of coronavirus there is no impact of coronavirus on demand today as we see it it is much more an impact on logistics because of parts of the country which are being isolated or roads which are being blocked or air freight today we have not seen any negative impact on our ability to operate so far we had some issues where we had to find options to get raw materials from a different location but all in all the issues we have been facing we have been able to resolve them and operate normally that being said as you can guess it s a very dynamic situation so we do have a team fully focused on that and only doing this day after day which is watching the flux of raw materials from a place to another to make sure we do a have a we do have what we need for our growth plan but yes it is something we are aware of and carefully watching but so far so good operator next question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global your line is open mike harrison seaport global analyst hi good morning mark a douglas president and ceo elect good morning mike mike harrison seaport global analyst i m looking at the one slide you have in there 13 growth in the latin american crop protection market in 2019 that seems like a lot were there really that many more planted acres or did we see increases in the number of applications was this trade benefits just wondering if you can help us understand the drivers of that very strong growth in the market itself and maybe get us more comfortable that we weren t just seeing a lot of inventory getting stuffed into the channel mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes mike listen i think it s a very good observation i think most people when we talk about a 13 growth rate most people put that straight toward brazil i think you ve got to parcel it out somewhat in the sense that the other regions are growing mexico grew in the north and then obviously argentina has been growing certainly for us but the market was relatively i would say low single mid single digits if you look at brazil surface area that was planted was probably about a 3 increase overall with soy leading the way we had a very good season on cotton strong infestation which obviously helped us but also the market was up because of that and cotton is a high usage of pesticides i would say though that overall i think the market has more channel inventory in brazil than the market would take so i think some of that 13 is setting warehouses right now i m going to be very frank and tell you that we talk about this constantly on every call and our inventories are exactly where we want them to be normal levels across brazil for the rest of this season and then heading into the new season that comes in at the end of this year but i do start to watch the channel inventories in brazil i think they are higher than normal pierre r brondeau chairman of the board chief executive officer and to complement what mark said and the level of inventory in the channel of fmc products just to remind what we said in the script growth was not driven in the fourth quarter for fmc by brazil it was other parts of latin america and a big driver was argentina so that is part of the process we have in place to make sure that in brazil we control channel inventory operator your next question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners your line is open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst good morning thank you for taking my question mark a question for you on insecticides as it relates to some of the regulatory dynamics with regard to chlorpyrifos we understand that that chemistry is being phased out in california and europe and so my question is whether fmc foresees any opportunity to gain share via substitute chemistries such as pyrethroids or otherwise and then second you mentioned the carbofuran exit i just wonder if you could address that in terms of opportunity to backfill there what options you may have in the portfolio mark a douglas president and ceo elect yes thanks kevin yes chlorpyrifos is a molecule that is as you said been removed in california we have very limited sales of chlorpyrifos around the world and we have exited basically all of that business so for us we see it as more of an opportunity and you re right pyrethroids especially our bifenthrin mixtures will be targeting those markets so we ll be looking to grow there and then on carbofuran yes we do see opportunities for our portfolio to replace what we already have and obviously if we were planning to exit we had plans to replace and those plans will be rolled out in mexico and parts of asia indonesia in particular where we will be replacing our own products with some of the newer technologies operator your last question comes from the line of joel jackson from bmo capital your line is open joel jackson bmo capital analyst hi good morning you did a good job of bridging free cash flow conversion major buckets over the next couple of years i just wanted to focus on the 19 versus 20 free cash flow conversion if looking at the roughly 100 million or 12 conversion that is expected in 2020 instead of 19 it looks like normalized for everything 2020 free cash flow conversion is actually less than 2019 conversion is that right and maybe you could just specifically walk through some of this specifically walk through exactly the difference between 19 and 20 if that s true andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes joel i think that the free cash flow conversion on a like for like is pretty consistent between the two years what you ve got are some puts and takes we have higher capital additions and higher legacy and transformation spending in 2020 than we did in 2019 to the tune of about 30 million combined we do see increased cash from operations part of that is the recapture of the delayed collections that we saw at the end of q4 and we also have to acknowledge we re growing the top line roughly 350 million 300 million 350 million at the guidance point and generating 100 million of ebitda it does take some working capital to continue to grow the business so that when you think through that walk again if we take 300 million in free cash flow in 2019 100 million in growth in ebitda a 30 million headwind from higher legacy and transformation and capital spending that gets you within 100 million of our guidance point that 100 million is the rebound the reversal of the q4 factors we ve talked about and a very minimal change in working capital beyond that very minimal use of working capital beyond that so it does imply continuing improvements in working capital efficiency and that s a part of our continued drive to drive not just waiting for the step down the transformation spending but to continue to drive down the working capital use in the business michael j wherley director of investor relations that s all the time we have for the call today thank you and have a good day operator duration 62 minutes call participants michael j wherley

the canadian dollar has fallen in recent times alongside oil prices the currency of canada is correlated positively with oil prices by virtue of canada s export exposures to oil related products the chart below indicates that mineral products i e including crude petroleum and refined petroleum among others represented over 24 of all canadian exports in 2017 source observatory of economic complexity it is also worth noting that transportation products including cars and vehicle parts represented a further 19 or so of canadian exports meanwhile metals represented over 8 of total exports this includes aluminium related products as well as refined copper copper wire and plenty of other finished and intermediate metal products the reason why we should note these other categories is because the demand for these are generally expected to correlate with the demand for oil oil metals and transportation products together represent over 50 of total exports that is a significant portion an exposure large enough to make the canadian dollar a commodity currency i e a currency which is correlated with commodity prices and associated with risk on activity indeed while oil does not make canada canada s exports are varied the country s exports are mostly likely to benefit from the upswing or growth phase of a typical business cycle speaking more straightforwardly if economic growth is positive and or markets anticipate positive economic growth the canadian dollar is more likely to find support how do we know if markets are anticipating growth and or inflation the prices of commodities such as wti crude oil and copper are likely to rise this information which markets communicate via price is subsequently likely to translate into the price action of cad fx crosses supporting cad most recently commodity prices have fallen this mostly coincided with the emergence of the coronavirus currently known as 2019 ncov a recognized epidemic which has currently resulted in 24 631 confirmed cases 494 deaths and 1 029 recoveries at the time of writing source john hopkins university note that the death rate of almost exactly 2 can be found by dividing the number of deaths into the number of confirmed cases there is however a likely lag effect which could mean that the death rate could rise however the number of recoveries is growing far faster than the number of deaths it may be an optimistic tone to take however it is likely that the coronavirus is going to be effectively contained even if the number of confirmed cases continues to grow so long as the growth rate remains non exponential and global efforts to contain the virus continue we should not see a spike in the number of international cases outside of the hubei province in china where the virus originated the number of cases outside of mainland china is currently only 212 as compared to the number of seasonal influenza cases which average an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness resulting in 290 000 to 650 000 deaths source world health organization in short as more information is received and as we learn more about the coronavirus it is possible and perhaps probable that markets begin to bid up the price of risk assets and commodities like oil and copper if we take the prior levels as starting points we could see a significant boost as the drop has already been steep for oil and copper even a modest level of support would likely support the canadian dollar it is also worth noting that the bank of canada canada s central bank has one of the highest short term interest rates globally at 1 75 this rate is technically even higher than the rate set by the u s federal reserve while the u s maintains a target range which runs up to 1 75 the lower limit of their target range is 1 50 and hence the midpoint of 1 63 means that the bank of canada has the highest interest rate among all central banks of g10 nations i e belgium canada france germany italy japan the netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and the united states source investing com most recently it would appear that usd cad has approached a level which coincides with prior highs yet the pair remains within a somewhat bearish trajectory each turning point forming a lower high since september 2019 the strength of the canadian dollar over time should hold provided that the bank of canada does not cut rates in its next meeting on march 4 2020 yet a cut of 25 basis points would still only bring the rate to the lower end of the federal reserve s target range and hence the canadian dollar is typically likely to remain attractive against other currencies such as the euro whose comparable rate is negative at 0 50 this being the european central bank s deposit facility rate from a carry trade perspective the canadian dollar remains attractive this would require a continued stabilization of oil prices though chart created by the author using tradingview the same applies to all subsequent candlestick charts presented hereafter meanwhile the eur cad pair looks equally attractive as a short opportunity the pair is trading lower most recently and i have written more extensively on this pair recently see article in which i stated my belief that the pair would not only meet with its recent lows under the 1 45 level but even see the 1 40 level over a longer time frame together the usd cad and eur cad pairs would appear to be attractive short opportunities a mixed exposure would probably be beneficial in this case to eliminate the effects of fluctuations in the tangential eur usd pair going long cad is probably an optimist s trade at present this author while initially vigilant with respect to the coronavirus headlines remains fundamentally optimistic cad crosses today appear to be perfect markets for expressing such optimism although the 50 handle on wti crude oil will be important to watch see chart below it is most probable that this 50 00 level will be retested in the near future it being a key level just under the lows of june 2019 august 2019 october 2019 and also the level at which oil was able to settle initially in 2018 following a significant drop however provided that oil prices can sustain prices above the 50 00 mark our bullish thesis on the canadian dollar should remain intact

president and ceo of ugi before we begin let me remind you that our comments today include certain forward looking statements which management believes to be reasonable as of todayâ s date only actual results may differ significantly because of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict please read our earnings release and our annual report on form 10 k for an extensive list of factors that could affect results we assume no duty to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that are different from expectations we will also describe our business using certain non gaap financial measures reconciliations of these measures to the comparable gaap measures are available on slide 7 of our presentation now let me turn the call over to john john walsh thanks alanna and good morning and welcome to our call i hope that youâ ve all had a chance to review our press release reporting first quarter results ugi posted a very strong q1 with each of our businesses performing at a high level our teams did an outstanding job of delivering this strong performance while executing a set of key initiatives that will provide the foundation for superior long term performance this was a noteworthy quarter for a number of reasons it was our first full quarter with the newly acquired cmg asset network and the first full quarter with amerigas back in the fold as a wholly owned ugi subsidiary it was also our first quarter with the combined rate structure for our gas utility as those new rates went into effect in october we also made significant progress on the major restructuring programs across our lpg line of business roger perreault described these programs on last quarterâ s call and weâ ve been hard at work over the past 90 days developing detailed plans that will be rolled out over the next 18 months those programs are delivering their initial results as planned and remain on track to deliver the committed savings and enhance customer service levels iâ ll review our key activities in q1 and then turn it over to ted whoâ ll provide you with an overview of ugiâ s financial performance in the quarter bob beard our executive vp natural gas will provide an update on our natural gas businesses including progress on the cmg system and iâ ll wrap up with comments on our strategic initiatives our q1 gaap eps was 1 while our adjusted q1 eps was 1 17 our adjusted eps was over 40 above our q1 fiscal 2019 adjusted eps of 0 81 and significantly exceeded the prior high point of â for q1 adjusted eps of 1 01 achieved in q1 fiscal 2018 both quarters have been adjusted for the mark to market valuation of unsettled hedges and other items which ted will cover later as i noted earlier this very strong earnings performance reflected the strength of our diversified businesses with all four business units contributing in a major way this performance was in a quarter when weather in the mid atlantic and europe was a bit of a challenge our french teams were managing the impact of the general strike activities and there were no opportunities for incremental capacity margin at energy services despite those challenges we delivered our highest adjusted q1 eps ever by a wide margin our teams did an exceptional job executing as we managed our supply chain to optimize margin and saw the positive impact of our restructuring programs on operating expenses all while maintaining high levels of service to our customers before i turn the call over to ted iâ d like to comment on the progress achieved in several key areas with major developments in q1 we had a very successful first full quarter with the columbia midstream systems and team the positive impact of the new fee based revenues is evident in the q1 financial performance of midstream and marketing adjusted ebit is up nearly 45 with cmgâ s contributions being the major growth driver also going forward we will be referring to the acquired cmg assets as ugi appalachia our utility had another busy quarter adding over 4 000 new heating customers while continuing to execute our broad range of infrastructure replacement and reinforcement projects our long term infrastructure replacement program remains on schedule the combined focus on infrastructure replacement and customer growth will remain for the foreseeable future as we invest in the infrastructure to serve our expanding customer base we expect capex for the utilities to exceed 400 million in fiscal 2020 amerigas had a solid q1 with adjusted ebit just below prior year despite weather that was slightly warmer amerigas continues to excel with our cylinder exchange and national accounts programs national accounts volumes increased 12 versus q1 fiscal 2019 and cylinder exchange volumes were up almost 7 weâ ll continue to look for opportunities to leverage our exceptional u s distribution infrastructure to drive growth in these two very successful programs ugi international had an extremely strong first quarter adjusted ebit was up substantially over q1 fiscal 2019 despite warmer weather we benefited from higher grain drying volumes lower propane and butane costs that enabled strong margin performance and lower operating expenses resulting from our transformation program in europe iâ ll return later on the call to comment on our strategic initiatives but iâ d like to turn it over to ted at this point for the financial review ted ted jastrzebski thanks john as john mentioned we delivered adjusted eps of 1 17 a 44 increase versus fiscal 2019 results our reportable segmentâ s ebit was 418 million compared to 346 million last year after a busy fourth quarter with the completion of two significant transactions our teams returned their focus on operational excellence and delivered a strong start to the fiscal year this table lays out our gaap and adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as you can see our adjusted earnings exclude a number of items such as the impact of mark to market changes in commodity hedging instruments a loss of 0 05 this year versus a loss of 0 46 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 last year we had a 0 03 gain on foreign currency derivative instruments compared to a 0 06 loss this year lastly you can see we adjusted out 0 06 of expenses associated with our lpg business transformation initiatives that we discussed in detail last quarter and weâ ll update momentarily before i get into the numbers on the year on year bridge i wanted to take a moment to reiterate how the seasonality of the amerigas business impacts our earnings as you recall from our q4 earnings presentation the buy in of amerigas shifts the timing of the companyâ s earnings over the quarters we now expect to earn roughly a 110 in the first two quarters compared to only 95 historically this outsized performance in the first half is then balanced with lower than historical performance in the second half okay returning to the slide we are off to a good start in fiscal 2020 we faced warm weather conditions compared to last year but benefited from our recent investments we delivered adjusted eps of 1 17 a 0 36 improvement versus our first fiscal quarter last year the amerigas merger incremental margin from cmg now ugi appalachia new base rates at the utility and margin management at ugi international were the biggest drivers of the year of the year over year improvement the 0 26 increase at amerigas was largely attributable to the full consolidation of amerigas results following the merger that was completed in august in the quarter we benefited from onetime tax adjustments primarily in france that were largely offset by the higher tax rates at corporate one final point our interest expense increased versus last year as we added debt to complete both the amerigas merger and cmg acquisition turning to the amerigas business the quarter got off to a cold start but warmed up in the critical month of december december weather was 9 warmer than normal and as a result volumes were down slightly versus last year amerigas reported ebit of 165 million which is roughly flat versus the prior year quarter total margin was also flat versus last year as the lower volumes were largely offset by higher unit margins opex increased 5 million principally the result of higher general insurance and vehicle lease expenses and other income increased versus the prior year period due to a gain on the sale of excess real estate on our last call roger spoke about the business transformation initiatives underway at our lpg businesses as a reminder amerigas identified over 120 million of permanent operational efficiencies that we expect to be realized by the end of fiscal 2022 we called out a 0 06 adjustment to earnings in the first quarter related to lpg business transformation expenses the majority of this expense comes from the amerigas business ugi international achieved ebit of 100 million compared to 59 million in fiscal 2019 the team delivered strong results in the face of another year of significantly warmer than normal weather total margin benefited from strong crop drying volumes and focus on margin management the large increase in total margin was driven by propane prices that were roughly 15 lower than the prior year period an effective recovery of costs associated with energy conservation certificates additionally the international team continued to manage opex in the challenging conditions i should point out that this improvement was supported by the translation effects of the weaker euro but also lower maintenance and outside service expenses compared to the prior year period lastly we broke out realized fx hedging gains from other income due to its significance in the quarter like amerigas the international team is also making an investment in the business to drive operational efficiency we expect these efforts to generate over â 30 million of permanent annual savings although itâ s early in the process both amerigas and ugi international are on pace to deliver the operational efficiencies in the time frame laid out on our last call turning to the natural gas side of the house midstream and marketing reported ebit of 62 million in the quarter compared to 43 million in q1 last year cmg or ugi appalachia was the main driver of the year over year improvement total margin operating and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and other income all reflect the impact of the acquisition we also benefited from our auburn iv expansion coming online in november but to a much lesser extent capacity management margin was lower in the quarter as pipeline capacity values remain depressed largely due to very low prices and warm weather pipeline restrictions did not meaningfully impact earnings in the quarter but we still expect pipeline operators to enforce them during periods of volatile weather lastly margin decreased at our hunlock facility due to lower electric generation volumes ugi utilities reported ebit of 92 million compared to 77 million in the prior year period total margin increased 15 million despite warm weather as a slight decrease in core market volumes was offset by increased base rates effective october 11 we also saw higher margin from large firm and interruptible delivery service customers as you can see opex decreased 3 million versus the prior year period due to increased systems and process capabilities and collections and lower compensation and benefits expenses lastly our depreciation expense increased versus the prior year quarter due to continued distribution system and it capital expenditure activity with that iâ ll turn the call over to bob for an update on ugi appalachia and our natural gas business priorities bob rob beard great thanks ted our natural gas businesses continue to focus on growth opportunities we are seeing at both our utility and our midstream and marketing companies and we continue to identify opportunities to drive efficiencies across both businesses by sharing best practices and as always we emphasize safety in everything we do at energy services weâ re very pleased with the quality of the team that joined us from columbia midstream group i remain encouraged about the growth potential of what is now ugi appalachia performance of these assets was solid in q1 this performance was driven primarily by throughput contracts and efficiency gains which helped control operating expenses while warmer than normal temperatures are helping drive lower natural gas prices the forecast is for continued growth in the natural gas production from the marcellus and utica when ugi announced the acquisition of cmg we indicated we would spend between 300 million and 500 million on growth projects over the next five years having owned these assets for approximately six months we continue to believe this level of growth capital is likely and we continue to work with our existing and potential customers to identify expansion opportunities our midstream activities in northeastern and central pennsylvania remains strong as well of note on november 1 we placed into service our auburn iv project which increased the throughput of the system by over 40 or 150 000 dekatherms per day the build out of our auburn system is just one example of how energy services continues to find growth opportunities in the marcellus and utica basins on january 30 ferc issued the declaratory order agreeing with penneastâ s view that the natural gas act properly gives for the authority to grant power of condemnation including against parcels in which states hold an interest to certificate holders penneast believes this is important information for the u s supreme court to consider when penneast filed its cert petition later in february also on january 30 penneast filed a request with ferc to face construction of the penneast project while demand for the overall project has not declined legal and regulatory delays primarily in new jersey have delayed the start of construction on the overall project in response to these delays penneast has received significant market interest and commitments for a phased project with initial delivery points in pennsylvania in addition to two delivery points that were initially planned with ugi utilities in columbia pipeline penneast intends to connect to the recently approved adelphia gateway pipeline which provides new supply to southeastern pennsylvania if approved this first phase would come online in november of 2021 â excuse me with the balance of the project estimated to be completed in 2023 our utility business continued to perform well in q1 despite weather that was 4 2 warmer than normal utilities recently filed a request with the pennsylvania public utility commission to increase natural gas rates by approximately 75 million this requested rate increase is driven by the record level of capital ugi utilities is deploying utilities expects to spend nearly 2 billion over the next five years to upgrade and expand our piping systems and enhance our it systems our infrastructure upgrade programs have significant impact on carbon emissions our co2 equivalent emissions have been reduced by approximately 30 since 2009 and we expect a further 30 reduction from current levels over the next 10 years growth at utilities remains robust as conversions from fuel oil to natural gas remains strong and we see an increasing interest in the use of natural gas for electric generation industrial processes and vehicle fuel over the last 10 years utility has added nearly 150 000 new heating customers the majority of this growth has come from conversions as customers choose natural gas to replace fuel oil these conversions provide our customers with meaningful savings and reduce carbon emissions for each converted customer by almost 50 so in summary weâ re very pleased with the performance of both natural gas businesses and see meaningful growth opportunities as demand for natural gas remains strong and with that iâ ll turn it back to john john walsh thanks bob iâ d now like to highlight developments in key areas that are crucial to our long term success from a strategic perspective the first quarter was noteworthy in several respects we continue to see significant demand for lng peaking as ldcs focus on accessing viable natural gas supply options to meet their peak demand our latest storage and vaporization project in bethlehem pennsylvania remains on schedule and we expect to bring that unit online later this year in addition to our large permanent units weâ ve also seen significant interest in portable lng systems which can be utilized to address short term supply challenges created by pipeline constraints or supply shortfalls due to construction activities our lng network remains a critical element of our midstream strategy and an area of strength for ugi the midstream and marketing team is active in the northeast marcellus in addition to the ugi appalachia activities in the southwest marcellus that i referenced earlier on the call as bob noted our auburn iv expansion project was placed in service on november 1 supported by a 10 year take or pay commitment as bob noted in his remarks we remain focused on our penneast project our partnership will continue to pursue the development of penneast with a two phased execution plan weâ re encouraged by the continued strong interest in this project penneast is a noteworthy project in our portfolio of investment opportunities for the company this portfolio in addition to penneast includes lng expansion capacity additions on our existing systems continued growth investment at utilities and the initial development of renewable natural gas and bio lpg projects the diversity of our portfolio is critically important as energy policy at the state and federal level evolve we made significant progress in q1 on the transformation programs underway at amerigas and ugi international as roger perreault noted on last quarterâ s call these initiatives are expected to yield 120 million of permanent operational efficiencies in amerigas and â 30 million of permanent efficiencies in ugi international in both cases weâ ll realize the full benefits by the end of fiscal 2022 we continue to be on track with these key programs and expect to achieve our fiscal 2020 commitments for savings related to these efficiency initiatives as bob noted we filed our latest rate request for our gas utility in late january for a total of just under 75 million we look forward to working with the puc and all the rate case constituents in the coming months weâ re hopeful that this process will conclude by the early fall and new rates will go into effect on or about october 1 given that q2 is the most significant earnings quarter of the year i thought i should comment on weather to date in the quarter in short the weather challenges that we saw in december continued through january weather in the eastern u s and in europe was over 50 warmer than normal in january the higher temperatures and plentiful supply also dampened pipeline capacity values in january consistent with our december experience as we did in q1 weâ ll look for every opportunity to take actions to help offset the short term impact of the challenging weather the long term strategic investments that iâ ve described and the critical transformation programs underway in the company provide us with a great foundation for future growth weâ re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the company with that iâ ll turn the call back over to kenzie who will open it up for your questions question and answer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of shneur gershuni please go ahead your line is open shneur gershuni hi good morning everyone john walsh good morning shneur gershuni maybe just to start off with literally your last comment on the prepared remarks given the fact that january makes up the bulk of the weather for this quarter and itâ s a bigger weather quarter are you still comfortable with your guidance range for this year do you feel that enough of the margin offset that you successfully achieved during last quarter you were able to extend this quarter and it can sort of partially offset where we are just sort of any comments as to how you think about it john walsh sure as you know we typically and this year will be no exception kind of revisit that at the end of the second quarter when the â basically the degree days for the year the winter season is over january is significant but february and march are material as well so yes we donâ t have any comment in terms of guidance and would just stick to our normal practice of waiting at least until the end of the winter season to comment on that shneur gershuni okay fair enough and then my follow up question is with respect to the update that you provided about the assets when we sort of see all the producers slowing their capex spends rig counts are falling and so forth you sort of talked about you still see opportunities for growth capital i was kind of wondering if â what kind of capital is it is it really just connection capital to existing facilities and so forth and is there an opportunity to actually defer some of the capex that youâ d intended to spend and redirect some of the capital towards buybacks or further deleveraging john walsh yes sure as we look at it today and weâ re talking to our customers or producers all the time we still have meaningful discussions underway essentially about expansion of existing systems so as â and each producer is in their own unique position but as they look at optimizing their capital spend and in almost every case trimming the capital spend in many instances their best option is an expansion in existing acreage thatâ s been developed and has already supported by gathering infrastructure so most of what weâ re doing is looking at the expansions to our existing systems which provide the producer with an efficient incremental production opportunity which can be very attractive at a time where some other production expansion opportunities require a lot more capital investment on their part so thatâ s the nature clearly weâ re going to be â our path and the timing of our spend will be determined in the end by the producersâ decisions around their production levels and where they want to bring that product to market but weâ re encouraged by the discussions weâ ve had even with the lower commodity prices so we havenâ t fundamentally changed our outlook on capital spend capex levels but obviously weâ re going to monitor that and weâ re going to be working closely with our customers as they finalize their plans around capital spend and production levels shneur gershuni just to paraphrase a little bit so youâ re basically saying the capital spend will be driven by what the growth plans are of your customers so if they end up deferring or slowing down their pace what do you do with the saved capex is it â do you consider buybacks do you consider leverage reduction whatâ s the priority john walsh sure sure we consider all those alternatives certainly for us and we â particularly for the last several quarters here as the two transactions were executed we talked about the prioritization of paying down debt in amerigas but itâ s important ugi corp as well but weâ ll look across all those alternatives in terms of incremental cash being available to deploy weâ ll look at paying down some of the debt weâ ll look at other new investments that could emerge so the full range of opportunities remain and you saw last year we obviously bumped our dividends significantly last year so weâ ll look at that full range to â and deploy any incremental available cash in the end and discussions with the board in what we see is the most effective way possible shneur gershuni all right perfect well thank you very much and i will jump back in the queue john walsh great thanks shneur operator our next question comes from the line of christine cho from barclays your line is open please go ahead christine cho good morning everyone john walsh good morning christine cho if i could start with the lower lpg costs in international can you just provide some more color on what drove it lower and how we should expect this to continue through the remainder of the year john walsh yes i canâ t provide you with a commodity forecast but generally whatâ s been happening internationally and weâ re specifically focused on europe is that the increased production levels of propane and butane and particularly in the u s have resulted in commodity costs dropping pretty considerably over the last year especially and because now the market for both propane and butane has become much more global and fluid weâ re seeing the benefits of that in europe so weâ ve seen a pretty solid drop in our costs which has helped and enhanced margins and the outlook as far as we can see in terms of the current future strip it remains attractive now that obviously can change but itâ s a pretty positive outlook and with warmer weather lpg â storage levels of lpg are quite high because demand is less weather sensitive demand so again thatâ s probably a positive indicator at least for the short term on costs remaining low but as a company weâ re ready to move if we need to if costs move in the opposite direction or unexpectedly but itâ s a very healthy supply environment as a distribution company and europe â as i noted earlier europe has become much more liquid over the last five years primarily due to the availability of propane and butane produced in the u s itâ s had a huge impact on the global market and as a distributor we benefited from that christine cho well like with the saudi outage in september like some global supply of propane and butane were brought offline did that impact europe at all john walsh no i mean you probably noticed it for a day or two there was almost a very minimal impact i think thatâ s a great example of how the market has changed europe used to be a lot more volatile with supply interruptions because europe was more dependent on product coming from the east and some from the gulf now youâ ve got product coming from the west from the u s in addition to some of these other supply options so thereâ s a resiliency now in europe that wasnâ t there five or seven years ago in terms of supply christine cho okay and then if i could just move on to the penneast phase one how do we think about economics here now that you split the project in two should we think that youâ re earning the full 14 roe on the phase one capital cost and assume like a 50 50 equity debt capitalization john walsh i think at a high level you could make that kind of assumption weâ re going to â you can make that assumption obviously weâ ll progress that weâ ve just made the filing with ferc weâ ll progress that and advise as we move forward but the fundamental economics of the project havenâ t changed materially christine cho okay great thank you operator there are no further questions at this time iâ ll turn the call back to john walsh for closing remarks john walsh okay thank you for your time and attention this morning we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress and to speaking with you again on our second quarter call take care operator this concludes todayâ s conference call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect

investor relations heading this call is being webcast and an archive of it will also be available on the website and now i d like to turn the call over to mark schiller mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director thank you rachel and good morning everyone nearly one year ago shortly after joining hain celestial i introduced our transformational strategic plan and shared key deliverables and milestones aimed at restoring credibility and confidence among our shareholders and customers as i reflect back on the hard work of our entire organization i can t help but be proud of the resilience tenacity and passion of our employees that has resulted in strong and consistent performance while we still have a lot of work ahead i m extremely pleased to report that we re executing and delivering on the plan we communicated and our financial and operational results demonstrate that our strategy is working in fact since we started our strategy last year our gross profit dollars gross margin ebitda margin and ebitda dollars have all grown considerably to remind you at investor day last february i laid out four clear strategies that would guide our journey they are one simplify the portfolio and organization two strengthen our core capabilities three expand margins and cash flow and four reinvigorate profitable top line growth in a core set of high potential brands while many initiatives have contributed to these results i d like to highlight a few that really capture the breadth and depth of the transformation on simplifying the portfolio over the last year hain has divested non strategic brands with almost 750 million in sales in all we ve divested seven businesses and we expect there will be additional non core brands sold in the future in addition as previously stated we re also likely to shut down other brands if there isn t a clear path to stable profitability or a logical buyer on simplifying our operations we ve consolidated manufacturing sites office locations and shipping locations around the world we ve integrated five sales forces in the united states to one we ve eliminated over 30 brokers in the united states and more than 30 co manufacturers on strengthening capabilities we ve hired a new senior leadership team in north america as well as brought on several new directors who bring significant industry experience and expertise to our board we ve improved forecasting resulting in almost 5 percentage point improvement in service and an almost 50 reduction in customer fines and penalties in the u s we ve enhanced the organizational training in areas like project management customer planning and innovation processes on expanding margins and cash flows we ve eliminated almost 50 million of low roi spending in north america discontinued approximately 500 skus worldwide that had low to negative gross margins reduced inventory by over 80 million since its peak in august of 2018 reduced our cash conversion cycle more than 14 days eliminated 380 million of debt resulting in leverage of roughly 3x ebitda on reinvigorating top line we filled the innovation pipeline with ideas that solve consumer problems and will expand their categories we ve developed new creative campaigns for a number of brands we strengthened consumer insight selling capabilities and customer relationships the impact of these efforts are just beginning to show up in our results and will be more evident as the negative sales impact of sku rationalization and spending reductions abate in the second half this year in summary we ve made significant progress and we ve transformed much of this business in a very short period of time that said we continue to see further significant opportunities to simplify the portfolio and organizational structure reduce costs and improve capabilities and our initiatives to reinvigorate top line growth are just beginning our momentum is accelerating and i truly believe our best days are in front of us let me now shift to our q2 results we laid out the plan for f 20 this past summer you ll recall i promised you three things one the top line trend for the first half would be similar to what we reported in the second half of last year and that the negative trends would begin to abate in the second half of f 20 two gross margins and profits would grow versus year ago in every quarter three ebitda dollars and margins would grow versus year ago in each quarter as well i m pleased to report that our second quarter results delivered on all key metrics and demonstrate another quarter of year over year improvement against our strategy and financial commitment we continued the momentum we started last winter and we remain right on track to achieve our fiscal 2020 operational and financial objectives importantly while delivering a double digit increase in ebitda in the quarter our marketing spending was also up 8 2 as we reinvested some of our profit growth back into our highest potential brands now to provide a little more detail on the individual reporting segments let me start with our north america business to refresh your memory we guided that our first half net sales growth would be comparable to the second half growth rate from a year ago when we started eliminating poor roi spending and reducing unprofitable skus last year s second half declined 8 7 q2 of this year declined 8 1 versus prior year so the results are right in line with our projections it s also important to note that the 8 1 decline is not reflective of the underlying health of the ongoing business embedded in that number is a 2 decline due to the lost sales from divested assets a 4 decline due to sku rationalization and a 1 decline due to the reduction in low roi investments so in reality the ongoing business is down only about 1 turning to margins adjusted gross margin improved 480 basis points versus year ago to 24 7 driven by continued improvement in our costs and better pricing and mix this is the highest adjusted gross margin that we ve had in any quarter since q3 of 2018 adjusted gross profit dollars improved 14 versus year ago adjusted ebitda margin for north america was up 370 basis points from prior year this was the third consecutive quarter of year over year improvement and was the highest ebitda margin in the quarter since fiscal 2018 adjusted ebitda dollars were also up a very strong 41 versus year ago while we re pleased with our progress we re far from finished and have identified multiple opportunities to continue to improve our margin structure and overall profitability in north america in fact we are in the process of consolidating canada and the united states into one north american operating unit a move which is expected to generate 5 million to 8 million of additional cost savings over the next 12 to 18 months breaking the portfolio in north america down further we delivered continued improvement on the get bigger brand sales declined 3 in the quarter which was slightly improved versus the minus 3 5 trend in the second quarter last year as a reminder the declines were driven by eliminating uneconomic spending sku rationalization and distribution losses in personal care relating to service issues from a year ago and we didn t expect to overlap them until the second half importantly despite these factors consumption on the get bigger brands was up 1 in measured channels get bigger velocities and the acv continue to grow and the average items carried which was down 5 last quarter was down only 2 this quarter so that s another favorable sign that our distribution is stabling and the new innovation coming and the trend should continue to improve we ve gotten questions in the past regarding margins of the get bigger brands and whether our long term guidance of 16 to 18 was achievable to that end in the quarter one year into our journey i m pleased to report that our ebitda margins for the get bigger brands have exceeded 14 in four of the last five quarters in q2 we again delivered a mid teens ebitda margin including 150 basis point investment in marketing this should further reinforce that as we guided on investor day we can drive profit growth and reinvest in these brands at the same time on the get better brands which are being managed for profit our gross margin improved 690 basis points from a year ago and our ebitda margin improved 750 basis points that s a huge improvement in a very short period of time now let me shift to our international business where our results for the quarter were also very consistent with our expectations net sales were down 1 for the quarter and flat in constant currency forex represented a 2 million headwind we saw a strong double digit sales growth in plant based proteins and beverages which was offset by sku rationalization and plant consolidation in fruit and increased trade in some competitive segments adjusted gross margin percentage in dollars and ebitda growth margin were also down slightly in the quarter the results were in line with our plan and include a significant investment in marketing in the quarter all in all given the difficult business environment in europe unrest in asia and uncertainty in the u k surrounding brexit our team worked diligently to deliver quarterly results that were in line with our plan importantly we also expect stronger trends in the second half of the year in a moment javier is going to provide detail on the outlook for hain in the second half of fiscal 2020 before he does i wanted to provide some perspective on the top line expectation for north america as you ll recall from the barclays conference we told you to expect declining net sales in the first half with the negative trend abating in the second half as we lapped the elimination of uneconomic spending and sku rationalization as well as service related distribution issues in personal care today i want to reiterate that we expect the north america top line trend to improve as planned in addition to lapping things that dragged down the first half results we re also driving growth by launching new innovation in snacks and yogurt increasing marketing spending and executing better on key programs like sun care while we don t normally give guidance by quarter in the spirit of transparency i wanted to give you a heads up that we expect q3 to be particularly strong on the get bigger brand in addition to all things mentioned which would yield strong results we also exited some less profitable club programs from h1 and while these programs were dilutive to our first half growth rate they re being replaced by more profitable events that will occur in the third quarter helping improve our overall third quarter growth rate while these programs are more in and out than permanent they provide further evidence of our momentum and continued strong relationships with our customers in summary our quarterly results and expectations for the second half continue to demonstrate that our business transformation is working well we have a terrific team in place and our confidence continues to grow that we will not only deliver our strategic and financial metrics but also restore hain to its rightful place as a premier cpg company with that i d like to turn the call over to new cfo javier idrovo to provide more detail on our q2 financials and fiscal 2020 guidance javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mark and good morning everyone it is my first earnings call as cfo of hain i am truly excited to be here to help drive the transformation turning to the financial results today i will focus my discussion on our financial results from continuing operations as you recall the company s presenting the results of tilda and the hain pure protein businesses within discontinued operations in the current and prior year period second quarter consolidated net sales decreased 5 year over year to 507 million in line with our expectations foreign exchange impact on the quarter was a headwind of 40 basis points when adjusted for currency fluctuations divestitures and sku rationalization net sales decreased 1 versus the prior year period from a profit perspective as expected q2 delivered year over year adjusted gross margin and dollar expansion and adjusted ebitda margin and dollar expansion specifically for the second quarter we expanded adjusted gross margin by 220 basis points resulting in adjusted gross profit of 112 million efficient trade spending and supply chain cost reductions in the u s as well as other productivity savings drove the improvement currency impact on gross profit was minimal in terms of productivity and efficiency we have made significant progress in the quarter as demonstrated by the meaningful improvement in gross margin for instance as discussed in our q4 earnings call the north america sku rationalization project is ongoing and benefiting current consolidated gross margin in addition in the u s distribution and warehousing costs discards and customer signs and fees have decreased over 12 million versus the prior year period sg a as a percent of net sales was 16 2 up from 15 2 in the prior year period we increased marketing spending by 8 in dollar terms excluding marketing expenses sg a was roughly flat to last year mainly driven by a decrease in broker trade funds adjusted ebitda increased to 45 million compared to 37 9 million in the prior year period currency impact was minimal adjusted ebitda margin improved 180 basis points year over year driven by gross margin improvement we reported adjusted eps of 0 17 based on an effective tax rate of 27 8 compared to 0 12 in q2 last year with an effective tax rate of 31 7 the lower tax rate was mainly driven by lower tlc impact than in the prior year period since mark covered much of our segment reporting highlights let me transition to our cash flow and balance sheet operating cash flow for q2 was 20 7 million an improvement of about 1 million versus the prior year period increased spending in our transformation initiative was a headwind on cash flows this quarter our inventory is 16 million lower than the levels at the end of june 2019 mainly driven by the divestitures carried out year to date and improved inventory management capital expenditures in the quarter were 16 million compared to 19 million for the prior year period operating free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capex was 4 6 million an improvement of about 4 million from the prior year period driven by higher operating cash flows and lower capex as of december 31 our cash balance was 37 million and net debt was 289 million we reduced hain s gross debt leverage ratio to 3 1 as of december 31 compared to 4 2 at the end of fiscal 2019 as we used the majority of proceeds from the sale of tilda to pay down debt before turning to the full year outlook let me briefly discuss the second half of fiscal 20 2020 for the second half we continue to expect diminished negative sales trends at the total company and at the north america levels as we lap the headwinds that mark mentioned and we launch new innovation in snacks and yogurt increase marketing spending and improved execution of key programs like sun care season as mark also said q3 will be particularly strong for our north america get bigger brands given the initiatives just mentioned and the reintroduction of some of our rotational promotional programs in q3 while these programs were originally planned for the first half they will now drive volume growth in q3 for international we expect that the sales trends will also improve in the second half based on the continued growth of our nondairy business and our lapping of headwind we experienced last year such as the sku rationalization service disruptions related to the fruit plant consolidation in england and warm weather during last year s soup season now let s turn to the full year outlook as a reminder our guidance excludes tilda which contributed approximately 200 million in net sales and 26 million in adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2019 for fiscal 2020 on a reported basis we now expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 177 million to 192 million an increase of 7 to 16 as compared to adjusted ebitda of 165 million in fiscal 2019 a strong improvement from last year and reflective of our continued momentum and confidence in our plan constant currency we now expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 179 million to 194 million on a reported basis adjusted eps is expected to be 0 62 to 0 72 with an effective tax rate of 26 to 28 compared to adjusted eps of 0 60 for fiscal 2019 an increase of 3 to 20 constant currency adjusted eps is expected to be 0 64 to 0 74 our annual guidance assumes an exchange rate of 1 28 per british pound as compared to 1 30 in fiscal 2019 it s translating to a second half exchange rate of 1 29 per british pound the full year foreign exchange headwind on ebitda is estimated at about 2 million compared to fiscal 2019 interest and other expense are expected to be approximately 21 million relatively flat compared to the prior year depreciation amortization and stock based compensation expense are expected to range between 65 million and 70 million compared to 55 million in fiscal 2019 we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at the low end of our earlier guidance or around 110 million given higher than expected costs associated with our transformation initiatives this represents a 70 million improvement from the prior year we expect a 15 day reduction in our cash conversion cycle from 75 days to 60 days driven by ongoing inventory reduction efforts and sale of tilda which was a cash intensive business as of the end of the second quarter our cash conversion cycle is down to 61 days we expect capital expenditures of 60 million to 70 million a decrease from earlier guidance given reprioritization of investment projects for the rest of the year from a cadence perspective we expect that the rate of sales decline in the second half of this year should improve compared to the first half primarily driven by momentum to get bigger brands from assortment optimization promotional activity innovation and marketing from a profit perspective we expect to continue to deliver adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda margin expansion each quarter versus fiscal 2019 and adjusted gross margin dollar and adjusted ebitda dollar growth each quarter as compared to fiscal 2019 our operational and financial results demonstrate that our transformational strategy is working and we re confident in our plan and ability to further progress throughout fiscal 2020 with that i will turn the call back to mark mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director thank you javier in summary we re executing at a high level and gaining increased confidence in our strategic objectives through the results we are generating every day our team remains committed to delivering strong consistent results for our stakeholders with clarity on how we achieve them and the continued path ahead i d like to thank our team our customers and our investors for their continued support of hain celestial with that we re now happy to take your questions operator questions and answers return to top questions and answers unidentified speaker thank you our first question comes from andrew lazar with barclays please proceed with your question andrew lazar barclays analyst good morning everybody mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director good morning andrew javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning andrew lazar barclays analyst hi there two for me first would be can we talk a little bit about when hain expects to lap the pulling out of the uneconomic spend and the sku rat in north america specifically as we go through the back half and then second mark as you think about to get bigger brands in general are there ones where the return to sort of the top line growth piece or building velocity and distribution with retailers has gone more quickly than you might have thought and some where maybe it s taking longer than you would have thought and if so trying to get a sense of why that would be on either end mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes so let me take both of those so on the first question remember that we in third quarter last year announced that we were going to start removing uneconomic spending and do another round of sku rats so that will finish up by the end of q4 might bleed a little bit into q1 but it will mostly be done by the end of the year because it really didn t start until the end of q3 of last year with regard to the second question on the get bigger brands yes it s is a mixed bag there are some customers that have very quickly and aggressively gotten behind us and said we like what you re doing we like where you are and we re going to double down on you and there are others given service challenges and some of the issues that we had over time who are in more of a prove it to me mode so the top line improvement is going to be a little bit choppy by customer and by brand for that reason but what i would tell you is a year to this journey we are in a much better place than we were a year ago in terms of customer relationships we re having annual planning sessions versus just coming in with rates and dates on the next trade deal that we need to execute we re coming with innovation that is surprising and delighting them in terms of it being real innovation versus just here s another flavor of something or another line extension we re bringing marketing programs shopper marketing programs using their shopper card data as well as digital social mobile outside of the store to drive people into the store so we ve repositioned ourselves as a growth company and again it s going to take some time in some places we have more momentum in some less and in some categories we have more momentum as we ve talked before personal care in particular which was settled with some service problems for an extended period of time we have more of a wait and see mode on from customers on that one andrew lazar barclays analyst got it thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from alexia howard with bernstein please proceed with your question alexia howard bernstein analyst good morning everyone mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director good morning javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning alexia howard bernstein analyst so can i ask about the timing and any idea of order of magnitude of the new product launches when do you expect those to really it sounds as though it s going to be next quarter that you expect the get bigger brand to really start benefiting from that is a lot of that step up just the selling of these new products as they go onto the shelf and do you measure your new products as a percent of sales either over the last year or over the last three years to be able to sort of quantify where it might have been historically and where you re hoping it s going to get to and i ll pass it on mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes so innovation is going to vary by customer and by category so they don t all reset at the same time in some cases the retailer may have two reset windows for a category and then they have one some reset in the spring some reset in the fall so there s no point in time where you ll see a dramatic step up it will be kind of slow steady improvement as we bring products out so in the first half to remind you we expanded our distribution on tea well which is doing well the incrementality of that item is very high so the retailers that have it are excited about it we need to do more work on the trial side to generate awareness but for those that are carrying it the repeat rate and the incrementality to the category has been terrific we also talked about bringing a bunch of innovation in personal care which is also off to a good start again because of the relationship and service issues that i mentioned before our acceptance on that has been modest but that was expected knowing that we had some proving to do to people but we have a cannabis sativa line in moisturizers and in body wash on jason that is doing very well we have a hydration sensation line on all but it s doing very well so the stuff that we ve launched is performing pretty well we need to get the acv up we need to continue to drive trial etc in the back half of the year what s happening is we re bringing yogurt and snacks innovation we just started shipping something called screamin hot veggie straws on sensible portions if you look at the salty snack category very significant percentage of volume done in hot skus or the flaming hot kind of skus that some of our competitors have in the more mainstream offerings nobody has done it in the healthier offerings that started shipping a week ago pretty good solid acceptance of that item and preliminarily for the 10 days of data that i have on velocities it s turning very well and on yogurt i believe i talked to you before about we were bringing four packs to market because we compete only in the multi serve tubs and that s only 30 of the category 70 of the category is in single serve and multipacks so we brought that toward the end of last quarter distribution on that one was spotty because it s less incremental to the category and more incremental to us we realize that we re solving our problem there and there s other category competitors who have that item but we re also coming back in the beginning of the fourth quarter with another piece of innovation on yogurt that will be very incremental to the category that we re getting good response on so long winded answer but it takes time the pipeline is full we re having much more robust kind of annual planning conversations so we re showing retailers innovation that s coming next fall and next winter so that they can decide how aggressively they want to get behind it and so i m much more optimistic going forward that we ll continue to show momentum there with regard to the second part of your question which was just how do we track it i m used to having a three year renewal rate that looks at what percentage of your sales this year comes from innovation over the last three years to be perfectly candid given that we threw out a bunch of line extensions that came and were gone a year later our innovation as a percentage of sales is tiny and that s one of the reasons why our tdps have been declining because we re not bringing new things to replace the underperforming things in our portfolio as well as to replace competitive items if they re just another flavor of something they already have the acceptance is going to be spotty and the incrementality is going to be very very low so we re now really pivoting to real innovation i told you last year it would take about a year to get that pipeline started we re seeing that to fruition in the second half of this year and it will be much more robust as we get into the first half of next year but i feel really good about where we are and the fact that it will become a much more meaningful piece of our sales going forward alexia howard bernstein analyst great thank you very much i ll pass it on mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ken goldman with jpmorgan please proceed with your question ken goldman jpmorgan analyst hi good morning and thank you mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director good morning ken ken goldman jpmorgan analyst two for me first i just wanted a little clarity if i could you mentioned that your operating cash flow will come in a little lighter than maybe what you expected and you talked about costs related to transformation initiatives being higher so i guess my first question is can you elaborate a bit on what those costs are and then my second question is you talked about some brands so you re still looking to divest some maybe still looking to potentially review some for just shutting down can you sort of update us on where you are in this i guess asset optimization process are you still negotiating with counterparties i guess we re trying to get or i m trying to get a sense of when you think this process will sort of i guess hit the later innings so to speak mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director so javier why don t you take the first part and i ll take the second javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer so ken on the operating cash flow i think one of the things that is impacting the operating cash flow is our transformation cost i will highlight we have had some higher than expected severances and that has been driven by some of the consolidations that we ve done in our manufacturing facilities and also some turnover that we have had in the managerial ranks and so we ve also we ve done some sku rationalization so the adjustments to the inventory values that hit the p l so that s also another driver for some of those costs mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director and on the divestiture question ken so we ve said very publicly that the brands that are in the get better bucket we are going to try and manage for long term stable profitability if we can t stabilize them generate more profit or if they re more valuable to somebody else than they are to us we will look to divest or shut those businesses down we ve made a bunch of divestitures i mentioned in the script that there were 7 including arrowhead mills and sunspire in the second quarter we are in active conversations on others that may be more valuable to someone else and we continue to assess some of the businesses that we have that we may not see a path to profitability so i would expect over the course of the second half of this year you will see more activity there i never want to say that we re done because once you make changes you have to go look at the portfolio you have left and resegment it again so this is going to be a reshaping of the portfolio over time but certainly the percentage of business that is in that tail is smaller today than it was a year ago it was roughly 50 of sales a year ago it s now about 39 of sales but the good news is a year ago that tail was about 10 of our profit and it s now about 20 of our profit so it s smaller and much more profitable which is great so that if we do keep those things you can expect more profitability out of them but again we have a lot of complexity and our intention is to continue to consolidate to a core set of assets that are going to make the most sense in terms of growth potential long term ken goldman jpmorgan analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you the next question comes from rob dickerson with jefferies please proceed with your question rob dickerson jefferies analyst great thank you so much so a bit of a follow on i guess to ken s question is just in terms of that cash even if there is some or there s been some near term headwind on the cash this year the trajectory year over year is still obviously positive and i d assume expect that cash to continue to grow positively in the next year so if ebitda is going up and this is i guess a similar question that we could have asked at your investor day but if ebitda is going up and the margin profile is improving continues to improve sequentially do you still view deleverage as a main focus right if you re around 3x or at some point especially if you look to potentially sell other brands or at some point do we hear the message that we ll now we are generating decent cash flow we think the optimization piece is there our plant footprint is in line and now what we re going to do with this cash is this and if not deleverage that s all i have javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so rob you re absolutely correct we are going to generate a healthy operating cash flow relative to last year in terms of capital structure i think that we are still targeting our 3 time to 4 time debt to ebitda ratio if we were to get below that number the prioritization of our investments our internal growth opportunities m a as they present themselves and as we find them to be viable and then i think third would be returning cash to shareholders via share buyback and i think we ve also talked about throughout the transformation dividends will not be part of the consideration set but after that that certainly can come into play mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes i think at 3x i think our debt is where it needs to be and as we sell off other assets i think javier hit it on the head we will either look to start acquiring again much more strategically in the priority categories that we ve discussed and or buying back shares to improve our earnings per share rob dickerson jefferies analyst okay perfect thank you operator thank you the next question comes from anthony vendetti with maxim group please proceed with your question anthony vendetti maxim group analyst thanks just on the get bigger brands that are going to be stronger this quarter which ones of these brands are working i guess and which ones are not working as well i guess because there s going to be it s going to be stronger overall as a group are there particular brands that you re putting marketing spend behind that are growing faster now mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes so we ve got a number of brands that are performing very well sensible portions which is our biggest north america brand is growing double digit we have nice low single digit growth in tea yogurt terra chips is a solid business where we ve really struggled the most is in personal care and that s where you re going to see the biggest jump in trajectory in q3 for two reasons one last year during sun care season because we couldn t service the business we basically were a very small participant in sun care and that is a big portion of our personal care business now that the service is back we re going to have a very robust sun care season so you re going to see some pretty significant momentum driven by that in addition the what as i referenced some first half club programs that were less profitable that have been transformed into third quarter programs that are more profitable those are also primarily in the personal care space a little bit in the snack space as well so that s where you ll see more of the momentum as we get to q3 but most importantly and this has been the big drag on that group of get bigger brands has been personal care and with improved execution we re getting much more confidence from customers to get behind those businesses and i expect that we ll see good momentum on personal care in particular in the second half anthony vendetti maxim group analyst okay great just as a follow up on the tea so tea is also stronger now right mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes tea is doing well we ve got the teawell innovation that i talked about we have some new marketing that s hitting the market on tea we have a very robust pipeline on tea and are very optimistic and excited about the next 12 months on that business as we are now talking to customers about multiple pieces of innovation that they re excited about so we actually had several years worth of innovation and as we show it to people they re like can you just bring it all at once so we re going to go pretty big on tea it s a huge category that s craving leadership and real innovation and we think we ve got the guns loaded really successful there so we re coming toward the end of tea season so the momentum that we have now will continue as we get into the fall and bring this innovation to life i m looking forward to very robust growth on tea going forward anthony vendetti maxim group analyst thanks very much i ll pass it along operator thank you our next question comes from steven stycula with ubs please proceed with your question steven stycula ubs analyst hi good morning and mark congratulations on all the hard work that you re doing on the portfolio mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director thank you steven stycula ubs analyst so my first question would be just a little bit of a clarification on the revenue outlook for the back half of the year can you help us understand how the sku rationalization steps down directionally in magnitude i think it s a 4 point drag now what does that look like in the back half and mark are you trying to signal that the third quarter will be better a growth rate than the fourth quarter because of some of these seasonal club wins mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director do you want to take the first one javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so in terms of the sku rationalization and the outlook for the second half the second half will have a shift decrease that is lower rate than the first half and we shared that with you in the remarks in terms of the sku rationalization i would say that we re largely complete with that effort there s about 90 of those skus that the company is no longer manufacturing and i would say only 20 of that dollar value associated with those skus flow through the p l this quarter so for the second half of the quarter or for the second half of the year the impact of the sku rationalization will not be as large as it has been for the first two quarters mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director okay i think you can assume 2 3 70 of it is behind the other 30 or so will be in the second half of the year with regard to the question around q3 versus q4 both of them will be better quarters than we had in the last four quarters but q3 will be particularly robust so yes i am signaling that q3 is going to be likely stronger than q4 because of these one timers now i want to also point out that part of the drag in the first half was us not repeating these club initiatives that generated significant volume so if you look at the negative trends in the first half we had some pretty meaningful volume programs that we didn t repeat which dragged down the year to date results we ve now moved those to q3 and they re going to be a tailwind in that particular quarter so part of the reason i didn t guide on the top line is because of that the choppiness of moving stuff between quarters and the choppiness of pulling out uneconomic spending and sku rationalization it s not going to be as linear as you would expect in a normal state but if you take away the club programs you re still going to see improvement in the underlying trends of the business as we forecasted all along so second half will be better than the first half with or without these club programs but with that extra boost in q3 it will be particularly robust on the get bigger brands in north america steven stycula ubs analyst okay and mark can you give any color on the baby business i didn t really hear a lot of that discussed on today s call and you have some good brands there so i just wanted to know strategically what are you seeing there in the marketplace from a competitive standpoint from retailer demand and a quick accounting question i noticed that there s a 4 million add back for sku rationalization this year in the ebitda bridge but there wasn t one last quarter so i was just curious as to why it was an issue now for an add back but not in q1 mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes so the baby business you remember is a sustainable contributor which means we re going to manage it for more stable top line and more robust ebitda margins it is a big business it s an outstanding brand but it s not one of our more profitable brands and in order to move it into the get bigger bucket that we would invest in from a marketing standpoint we need to do some transformation of the p l so what we have done is a fairly significant part of the sku rationalization that we announced last year is in baby because we had spread that brand into 30 or 35 different categories we were doing chicken nuggets and pizza bites and diapers and wipes and lotions and we had just spread this very thin and weren t making a lot of money in some of the ancillary categories so part of the first half sku rationalization drag is in baby food we have significantly improved the margins of that business we are innovating in categories that have higher margins so that we can again continue to drive those margins as well as restore the top line to more stability now that the sku rationalization is winding down so there s a lot of work going on in baby food but we ve got to get it to a double digit ebitda margin business before it s something that we would really invest in in a bigger way so we ve got more work there but significant progress has been made do you want to take the second javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so on the adjustments to ebitda i would say the things that are different between this quarter and last year s second quarter would be the productivity and transformation costs and i alluded to those drivers in the earlier question then the other item would be the sku rationalization that is also impacting this quarter more so than the prior year s second quarter so that will be the other item that would drive the differences operator our next question comes from john baumgartner with wells fargo please proceed with your question john baumgartner wells fargo analyst good morning thanks for the question mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director good morning john baumgartner wells fargo analyst mark obviously the focus this year is really on culling low return trade programs but i m curious as you lap these actions going forward can you speak a little bit as to how you re thinking about what a normalized trade environment looks like when you think you get there and then i guess also how you re thinking about reinvesting from here i mean i ll assume there isn t one way of traditional advertising given the size of your brand so should we think about it as in store sampling in store displays i m thinking about how you re connecting these new products with the consumers mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes so on the first part so not all of the elimination of uneconomic spending is trade i don t want to be perceived that we re just looking at trade we had a lot of marketing spending that was very inefficient we ve looked at resources and how we ve deployed them and a lot of that was inefficient so when i say elimination of uneconomic spending i m talking across the entire p l that s the first point i would make with regard to trade specifically what we re doing is eliminating low roi events and replacing them with higher roi events so the club example that i was just talking about is a great example of that we had a big club program last year that lost significant money and we said we re not going to do it again because what we were doing is taking three different components from three different manufacturing locations shipping them to one place repacking them and then shipping them out to the customer and by the time you add all that cost we couldn t make any money at it so we replaced that program with one that is more profitable for us that makes sense in the second half so it isn t just about ripping out trade it s about redeploying it into places where we can get a higher roi return i think once we get toward the fourth quarter we will have basically taken out all the inefficient trade that we need to take out and as i said we re trying to redeploy that in ways that are more productive with regard to investing in the brands we have added marketing spending in the second quarter we will add marketing spending in the second half of the year as well so as we make the shift toward growth again now that we have the innovation and new marketing campaigns you ll start to see us taking some of our profitability to the bottom line and some of it going back into the brands our philosophy in terms of how we re going to activate these things given that our history has been we start in the natural channel and then we gradually migrate into food and mass these are not national brands right so you re not going to see in most cases we don t have more than 50 acv and we ve got probably 10 or less household penetration on most of these brands so you re not going to see national television on these businesses it s going to be much more surgical much more scrappy and we start from the store and work out so if customer x gets behind screamin hot sensible portions as an example we start with how do we activate that in store that can be with displays that can be with shopper marketing vehicles then we would go to their shopper card data and say how do we leverage the target consumer with their shopper because we know we have distribution there then we would geo target around their store locations so anybody that lives within five miles of a store how do i make sure they see a digital or social or mobile ad and so it really emanates from the store outward which is very efficient and very targeted versus something that you re hitting the whole marketplace when only half of the stores in the marketplace carry it so it really is a reward the retailers that get behind the business and activate with them versus just spray the market with a lot of spending that will have a lot of inefficiency in it john baumgartner wells fargo analyst great very helpful thanks mark operator thank you our next question comes from dave palmer with evercore isi please proceed with your question dave palmer evercore isi analyst thanks good morning and great job on your shift to a more profitable core this year mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director thank you dave palmer evercore isi analyst just a question on tea i had been thinking tea could have been a little bit more of an improvement than up low single digits i was wondering if you thought weather has been an impact there and we re also questioning whether the data we re looking at is right it looks like teawell s distribution is something like 20 in the measured channels but maybe you can talk more broadly about how that has been accepted this year and how this general year for tea has gone versus your expectations and i have a quick follow up on snacks mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes so the weather is definitely not helping us on tea this has been a very warm winter so both our soup business and our tea business suffer a little bit when it not sub 32 in the northern part of the country so yes that s a factor on teawell the distribution is in the mid 20 range so your numbers are not incorrect again that i would tell you historically this has been a natural channel company that doesn t have as much presence in the measured grocery channels and so we re breaking down those barriers and we re making progress there teawell because it s new and it s different it the sell in has taken some time would i like to be further ahead than 25 distribution yes of those that have taken it are they pleased with the results yes so we re going to continue to push that and take the examples of success we have in the marketplace to the people that didn t take it and show them why they need to get behind it but it that s why i say our innovation process is going to be a little bit more of a gradual improvement versus what you may be used to in some of the 10 billion plus cpg businesses that just come with big slotting checks and they get very high distribution very quickly these are because they re health and wellness items and because the mainstream grocers and mass channel customers are just kind of figuring out how they want to play in health and wellness it takes more calls it takes more visits to explain why this is going to be incremental and why even though it s going to turn slower than non healthy versions of things that it s going to be much more incremental to their category so as the leader in health and wellness we ve got a lot of work to do in terms of educating and partnering with retailers on the potential of health and wellness and how they should position themselves to win but at the end of the day what i would tell you is teawell is doing well we will continue to see momentum build on that and it will be an important part of our business going forward dave palmer evercore isi analyst and then just a follow up on another investment category in snacks it looks like sensible portions is killing it there was a day back in i think it was in 2015 when walmart really ruined the year clean store initiatives and whatever and that brand was like the only leg standing for hain back then but i feel like i just want to make sure that you feel like you can maybe broaden the growth within snacks and you re not overly dependent on promotions in the near term with one retailer and such that you just feel good about the snacks business in general continuing to be the growth driver that it s been i don t want to take that for granted and i ll pass it on mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director yes no we believe very strongly in our snacks portfolio we have a terrific set of brands i d say on top of sensible portions terra is a very unique and differentiated brand as well we are seeing very significant growth on sensible portions outside of walmart so we are not as walmart dependent they were definitely a big factor in our step backwards but again a lot of this was self induced in terms of our own service problems right so now that that is old hain and it s behind us we have the confidence of the retailers those products are not as not relying solely on us dropping price and being trade dependent they re good brands with good consumer franchises and what i love about our snacks portfolio is that it has huge potential across into the mainstream because we re not unlike our personal care items that may sell at 10 or 15 or even 20 a bottle everybody can afford our snacks items snacks are impulse purchases they re you can always get people to buy more snacks it s been a perpetually growing category forever so we re very excited about snacks we continue to drive margins there because it s not our highest margin business but it is one with tremendous potential and it will be a very very critical part of our growth initiative going forward dave palmer evercore isi analyst thank you operator thank you it appears we have no additional questions at this time so i d like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments mark l schiller president and chief executive officer director thank you thanks everybody for all your questions and support hopefully your takeaway is the journey that we laid out at investor day a year ago is materializing exactly as we had planned we re very excited about the second half and what we have to come and as i mentioned between the marketing and the innovation and assortment optimization and the things that we talked about a year ago that would ultimately the drivers of top line that those are starting to come through fruition as well and so we thank you for your support we look forward to the future and continuing the dialogue with you thank you javier h idrovo executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much

the phase one agreement signed last month quelled the protracted trade conflict that tied up the world s two most powerful economies imperiled global growth and caused chaos for multinational corporations the terms required both nations to de escalate tariffs and compelled china to buy an additional 200 billion in american goods over the next two years levies will be slashed from 10 to 5 or from 5 to 2 5 on hundreds of u s products starting feb 14 china s finance ministry said the tariffs on cars oil soybeans and other goods date back to september and had been implemented in response to additional tariffs the u s had applied in the fall the widely expected move comes as china is paralyzed by the coronavirus which has infected more than 28 000 in the mainland and killed more than 500 it has also brought china s powerful manufacturing industry to a standstill as travel restrictions freeze china s workforce and major companies such as boeing apple and nike have been forced to close factories until at least mid february mcdonald s starbucks kfc levi strauss h m and samsung have closed stores across china casinos in macao the world s biggest gambling market are shutting down for two weeks the recent cut in chinese tariffs is more about containing the economic damage to china from the coronavirus than it is about trade relations between the two countries brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network said in commentary thursday along with the recent moves by the pboc to inject money to protect their markets this is aimed at managing the risk china is the world s leading oil consumer and the country s lockdown has sent shock waves through crude markets brent crude prices hit a one year low earlier this week and bp has warned the virus could reduce global oil demand by as much as 80 this year opec and its allies have been meeting to discuss oil output in the face of declining demand even if the virus is contained soon economists are predicting china s growth rate will fall to between 3 and 4 this quarter reducing tariffs and importing more food from the u s makes a lot of sense for the chinese the chinese government is facing a number of homegrown problems the major one being the outbreak of the coronavirus said ed yardeni president of yardeni research they are clearly in need of importing more food the swine flu epidemic last year decimated their pork supply now there is evidence their chickens are facing a virus they need our food food inflation is soaring in china there have also been disruptions in their transportation system further complicating the food supply china s ministry of agriculture and rural affairs announced an outbreak of the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus that wiped out 4 500 birds on a poultry farm in the hunan province earlier this week the world health organization said the virus does not infect humans easily and that the person to person spread is unusual but h5n1 compounds dangers for china s poultry industry as the coronavirus has made it difficult for farmers to receive chicken feed hubei poultry farmers said they were very distressed about the situation in a letter to the china animal agriculture association last week experts are skeptical about china s ability to deliver on the additional 200 billion in american purchases it is supposed to make and the likelihood seems slimmer given the outbreak but the pact includes a disaster clause which allows for some leniency in the event of a crisis like the coronavirus the u s is slated to follow suit and cut tariffs on certain chinese imports from 15 to 7 5 also on feb 14 in an interview with fox business earlier this week white house national economic council director larry kudlow acknowledged that the outbreak could delay china s purchases but he said the effect on the u s economy would be minor we re just trying to help china right now kudlow said tuesday it s not going to be that big a deal for us china has agreed to buy an additional 76 7 billion in u s goods and services in the first year of the deal a 41 jump from the 187 5 billion it spent in 2017 according to the office of the u s trade representative the chinese have agreed to dollar targets for services as well as for farm goods energy products and manufactured goods new sales for american farmers alone are expected to near 40 billion in the first year up from 24 billion u s agriculture secretary sonny perdue said wednesday that the u s should be patient with china if it struggles to hit these targets amid the outbreak reuters reported if they re really trying and it really just blows the economy out of the water then we would have to be understanding of that perdue said speaking to reporters at a cattle convention in texas farmers were among those hit hardest by the trade war and the u s government has tried to stem the losses with a 28 billion bailout american farm bankruptcies jumped 20 in 2019 hitting an eight year high according to recent analysis from the american farm bureau fresh data from the commerce department on wednesday showed that the u s trade deficit with china narrowed in 2019 for the first time in three years as both nations slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports the deficit with china fell 73 9 billion to 345 6 billion last year china hopes that both sides will abide by bilateral agreements and make an effort to implement relevant provisions so that we can boost market confidence promote bilateral trade relations and global economic growth china s state council tariff commission said in a statement the sign of de escalation lifted overseas markets with hong kong s hang seng index closing up 2 5 and europe s benchmark stoxx 600 index on track for its best week of trading since 2016 but wall street which has been on a tear all week seemed to shrug with the dow jones industrial average flat in early trading

fourth quarter performance was as expected and compared to the prior year period was a bit mixed across the operating segments unit volume demand for beverage cans remained strong with our global volumes up 7 in the quarter and 3 for the full year offsetting continued weakness in european food and planned activity reduction in transit for the full year adjusted earnings came close to the 2018 level even after absorbing 0 50 per share of headwind from non cash pension expense and currency translation free cash flow a record 754 million or 5 59 per diluted share benefited from significant destocking in transit as we called activity in light of lower overall manufacturing activity in response to the growing global demand for beverage cans we commercialized four new production lines in 2019 with at least three new lines and the conversion of two lines from steel to aluminum scheduled for 2020 we ve summarized the progress and timing of the announced 2020 projects in last night s release as to the announced increase in 2020 capex we ll leave that to the q a portion of this call in a supplemental table we have provided the currency impact on sales and income by segment so my comments will focus on currency neutral performance and at today s foreign exchange rates we currently expect currency translation to have little impact in 2020 compared to 2019 before reviewing the operating segments our tin plate steel price expectations are for mid single digit declines in 2020 in our steel aerosols and food can businesses we will adjust selling prices according to contract which will result in margin pressure in the first quarter as we work through our higher cost inventories that impact is roughly 0 20 per diluted share in the first quarter split equally among european food and the non reportables businesses today delivered aluminum is about 0 14 a pound cheaper than this time last year so as we are on pass through for almost all aluminum this will result in lower reported revenues in the beverage can businesses but have no impact on absolute margins turning to the segments in americas beverage overall unit volumes advanced 8 in the quarter with north america up in the low double digits and latin american operations up in the mid to high single digits the new plant in rio verde brazil began commercial shipments in late november and the plant continues to perform significantly ahead of its learning curve the third line in west ontario began shipments in late january and we expect an early q2 start up for the third line in nichols demand remained strong throughout all of the americas markets and we continue to review opportunities for further capacity expansion segment income up 25 in the quarter and nearly 20 for the year reflects the increased volume and the elimination of excess freight and other cost headwinds based in 2018 for 2020 we expect the segment to post income gains although not to the same magnitude as in 2019 and perhaps weighted more toward the latter quarters as weston and nichols work through their respective learning curves unit volumes in european beverage increased 9 in the quarter primarily related to the two new facilities in italy and spain gains to the prior year were also notable in eastern europe france and turkey middle east demand was firm with volumes up 0 5 in the quarter and for the year overall segment unit volumes were up 6 reflecting europe up 9 and the middle east off 1 5 as in the americas the supply demand situation remains tight and while we review expanding capacity we believe the overall market return profile needs improvement for 2020 we expect growth in the segment s income performance although the first quarter will be a bit behind the first quarter of 2019 as the civil plant will be down for the entire quarter as we complete the aluminum conversion sales unit volumes in european food improved 1 in the quarter and for the year were up 1 5 this is well below the 6 growth we had forecast coming off of very poor harvest in 2018 as we have discussed with you in earlier quarters the 2019 selling price increase was not enough to cover inflationary cost increases including tinplate steel this negative price inflation combined with negative mix and lower q4 production levels led to the decline in segment income for the quarter and while we did lower production activity in the fourth quarter we still ended the year with far too much inventory which will be felt in the first quarter of 2020 as that higher priced inventory runs through the system against the market backdrop of mid single digit tinplate steel declines so underperformance in q1 of 2020 with the business recovering to a level overall performance for the year asia pacific continued to benefit from strong demand throughout southeast asia with unit volumes shipments up low double digits for both the fourth quarter and the full year and for 2020 we expect performance to be a bit flatter than we ve reported in recent years as the full impact of our late 2018 asset repositioning in china takes effect in 2020 excluding currency sales in transit packaging declined 7 in the quarter and 2 for the full year due to lower overall volumes in the pass through of lower raw materials principally steel net volumes were up 4 in the quarter and 1 5 for the year with declines more notable in protective packaging and tooling segment income in the fourth quarter reflects volume mix and 6 million of under absorption of fixed costs as the business lowered activity as planned to drive down working capital levels the business had a record operating year in 2018 and a record cash flow year in 2019 and adjusting for currency 2019 performance is not too far from the business we acquired at the end of 2017 despite a slowdown across a number of industrial end markets and minimal capital investment the 2019 working capital reduction plan resulted in the business generating unlevered free cash flow well above 100 of its ebitda percentage that i have seen very business very few businesses deliver and certainly a significant proportion of the company s overall free cash flow in 2019 equipment backlog stands at over 100 million higher than at this time last year and for 2020 we expect segment income in the business to exceed 2019 levels by 10 million to 15 million and be weighted toward the third and fourth quarters as the comps become more favorable fourth quarter income in the non reportables businesses benefited from a strong result in our beverage can equipment making businesses and for the full year north american food cans posted a strong gain over the prior year and combined with the improved results in can making equipment offset overall market softness in global aerosols and as described earlier non reportables will start the year slow in q1 as we cycle through higher priced steel inventories the board led portfolio and capital allocation return review is ongoing and it would be premature for us to comment ahead of the board s conclusions but we will provide updates as warranted by future board decisions so as we stated at the outset of productive year in 2019 adjusted earnings almost on top of the prior year despite 0 50 of headwinds from two non operating items record free cash flow deleveraging on target and significant new beverage can capacity commercialized in 2019 with more to come in 2020 all leading to significant value creation for shareholders in the future as we have said since at least this time last year the future for beverage cans is very bright customers and consumers alike continue to embrace the can as their package of choice recognizing its inherent environmental advantages over other substrates offering crown and the industry substantial growth opportunities in the future equally important in food cans and as we said last year if governments ngos retailers consumers and others are serious about sustainability and not just giving a lip service then they too should be embracing and promoting the food can when it comes to limiting food and packaging waste increasing recycling rates among other advantages the food can should be the package of choice compared to less environmentally responsible packaging such as pouches and thermoform trays among others and with that kristal we re now ready to take questions thank you questions and answers operator thank you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer kristal we re not hearing any questions operator so participants are now starting to queue in the question and answer session i do have here now our first question comes from the line of gabe hajde from wells fargo securities gabe your line is now open gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst thank you thanks for all the detail tim tim you mentioned the machinery business it s not something that we talk about very often but my understanding is that it has pretty attractive margins is that something that we would anticipate i guess maybe can you size up that business on the revenue side and then something where we would expect to see pretty nice growth over the coming years given a lot of the beverage can activity timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so always a little careful when we describe revenues because we eliminate the revenues which are sold inter company among the crown affiliates but third party revenues on the order of about 100 million it s a business that like a lot of equipment and tooling businesses will run through cycles and as you point out given the extremely positive outlook for beverage cans we would agree with your the thesis within your question that that business should benefit as we look forward gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst okay and then moving to the european food side i m going to the optics of if we look at just the income statement over the past five years and post the mivisa acquisition i appreciate there s been two consecutive years of terrible crop yields and growing conditions but is there anything that you can point us to that gives us confidence that there isn t something structurally wrong within the marketplace that we should be concerned about timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i don t think we haven t lost any share and we haven t seen the merchant can market lose any notable share to self manufacturing certainly after the mivisa acquisition i think when we completed the mivisa acquisition in 2014 the euro was at about 1 33 or 1 35 it s on the order of 1 10 now so some of what you ve seen in reported we report in dollars so some of what you ve seen reported is currency related on the euro side the decline is not as significant as you see in dollars but nonetheless we ve had as you rightly point out two terrible crops and i think as we described earlier in the year perhaps we and some others in an effort to try to make sure we didn t experience volume declines in 19 like we did in 18 with a bad crop perhaps we the customers received too much advantage in terms of pricing that is we didn t adjust pricing enough in 19 to offset the cost inflation we had in the business not just steel but all costs and i think that s something that we and the team are working on to try to address going forward but i don t think there s anything structurally wrong in the business we ve had a couple of disappointing harvests and frankly we didn t manage pricing very well so we re we ve made a change in the business and it s incumbent on the new managers in the business to turn that around gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark wilde from bmo capital markets mark your line is now open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst thanks good morning tim good morning tom thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst tim i wonder can we talk a little bit about that 600 million in capex and what might be in there it s a fairly large year over year increase timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer let me talk a little bit about it not a lot so i think we ve historically spent at least for the last i d say historically but for the last five years in the order of 400 million to 450 million mark you ve been in a number of beverage can plants not just crown s but our competitors and you understand that beverage can by its very nature and part of the moat around the business is the capital infrastructure associated with making beverage cans so you appreciate that it s you ve got to feed the beast so to say and as part of the moat we enjoy as well so as we look at the opportunities we have certainly in north america and in a growing asian business we are of the mindset that there is an opportunity for us to accelerate capital and reap some of the rewards and reposition the business in the most favorable light for the future so as i said in the prepared remarks and as you see in the news release we ve described to you the projects that we re comfortable announcing at this point but there are a number i would say two to three to four other projects that we are actively working on that we re not quite prepared to publicly talk about but perhaps we will talk about them in more detail in the april call but i don t think we re that far away from telling you what we re working on it s just we re trying to tie up a few loose ends but you should consider that that would embrace north america and asia pacific mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay tim i just wanted on the other side of it can you talk at all about what you re seeing or what you re expecting in terms of kind of can sheet supply and whether we might see some can sheet supply additions here in north america i mean it seems like the kind of trade issues around can sheet have only complicated things over the last couple of years there s also been an issue with kind of aluminum scrap values so if we could just get a little color on that issue timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so i mean we haven t the aluminum scrap issue is perhaps more specific to somebody else it has to do with the american producers not wanting to take scrap back in net terms in any great any greater proportion than the aluminum can sheet they provide so i e if aluminum is coming in from other countries they don t want to be taking any more scrap back and reprocessing than what they need in their own smelters i think globally there s plenty of aluminum can sheet available china is a leading if not the leading aluminum can sheet supplier the quality is at par or soon will be at par to the other manufacturers in the americas and europe it s a question of price and we all try to do our best to attain the best price we can for our customers to the extent is there going to be more can sheet supply created by the manufacturers of can sheet in north america well that s a question for them and the answer that they ll give you is as we ve said earlier they probably want to see some reward to that as well so their business is extremely capital intensive and but there s plenty of can sheet supply out there mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay fair enough i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you mark mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst thank you our next question comes from the line of george staphos from bank of america george your line is now open george staphos bank of america analyst thanks hi everyone good morning thanks for the details as always i want to hit first on european food tim if you could so as it was teed up earlier i think by gabe obviously you re coming off a couple of tough harvest but there have been other secular issues within the business on a longer term basis obviously is the business now earning what you think is a fair return relative to your cost of capital can you comment on what dollar amount or what initiatives you need to do maybe beyond pricing maybe it s just pricing you need to get to be earning cost of capital and then i have a couple of follow ons timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah well listen we re clearly earning well above our cost of capital in european food we don t we can discuss whether we spend too much or too little in european food but for roughly a 2 billion business we re spending about 30 million in capital a year so that s not very much and year on year even with the decline in earnings the cash flow that s generated by the business is tremendous against the backdrop of minimal capex and so we can have a discussion as to whether we re not spending enough or whether we re spending an appropriate amount but clearly earning it s well above its cost of capital that doesn t mean we re satisfied with the earnings profile of the business it s down significantly from recent years okay the harvest were disappointing but honestly we re disappointed in our own performance and we ve got to do better now does that mean we need to do some restructuring close one or two plants perhaps but i think we d like to understand before we do that because we re pretty well balanced with the exception of one or two plants demand has not really declined i think we re going to see some demand pick up this year but it s more around pricing and appropriate levels of cost recovery so the answer george is we ve not done a very good job managing the business we need to do better george staphos bank of america analyst understood tim thanks for the candor on that i guess the next question i had just going through the list can you give us a bit more color in terms of not just your biggest segment but why asia isn t trending better than flat and i don t know if i get exactly how you worded it timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so i made the same comment last year at this time that we were going to be flat in 19 versus 18 and they did about 4 to 5 better in 19 versus 18 i just think that we ll feel the full impact of the repositioning of china in 19 so we re going to take another leg down in chinese income this year so we probably went half of the way down in 19 and we ll go fully the way down from what i expected last year in 20 so it will offset the growth in southeast asia and then we re kind of then we kind of reset and we start growing again in asia but a very a pretty satisfying market overall i think we re earning what 15 or so percent earnings and the business is growing and it is competitive but we re well positioned and we have we certainly have a very low cost profile compared to the other regional competitors there george staphos bank of america analyst all right and my last question and i think i kind of get it just from the press release but given the growth that you re seeing in beverage cans obviously you re ramping capital spending as you noted in mark s question and going through some of the projects the press release says your other global metal packaging and transit businesses continue to generate significant and stable free cash flow funding your beverage can expansion so should we take from that that given the growth that you see in beverage cans both the stuff you can talk about now and the stuff that you have on the horizon that you aren t finding a capital allocation constraint in beverage cans relative to the rest of the portfolio or not how would you kind of have us think through all of that thank you and good luck on the quarter timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer george you re always a clever guy so you re trying to get me to talk about the board process here with an interesting question i think that we are fortunate that we have businesses that generate stable and consistent free cash flow that allow us the luxury of investing in an expanding global beverage business and i think the beverage business and we ve described it and others have described it and i think it s going to be extremely healthy for the next several years we ll see what happens beyond the next three or four years but certainly for the next several years we re going to have an opportunity to continue to build out our footprint modernize the footprint lower the cost profile that we can offer the customers such that the can becomes even more competitive against other substrates but that does require cash among other demands that shareholders want from organizations and shareholders want not only growing businesses but they want dividends and share buybacks so when you put it all together the board has is in a process right now and they re trying to understand the thesis that s being offered as to should we limit ourselves to fewer product lines versus the separation of those product lines and the leakage that would come from those product lines and the ongoing cash flow afforded to the overall organization to accomplish not only growth in beverage cans but the ability to pay dividend and buyback stock in the future so i think the statement in the press release is pretty straightforward we believe we re fortunate we have a number of businesses in the portfolio that generate stable and consistent free cash flows which at this point in time are fueling a growth in the beverage can business and it s always important to remember at this point in time so i don t think it s appropriate for me to say any more than that at this point because the board is reviewing that george staphos bank of america analyst tim thank you very much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thanks george operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi from r w baird ghansham your line is now open ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst thank you ma am good morning everybody thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer hi ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst hey so i guess going back to the capex of 600 million which would be obviously a record for your company just from a high level i mean is this a function of spending too little given your leverage post signode and this is sort of a catch up phase normalization whatever you want to call it and then i think you mentioned north america and asia is a likely market for the increase in capex and so for north america should we think about the new plant or line additions and what about brazil given outsized growth in the region i mean obviously you had the capacity there but is that really enough to support the outsized market growth we re seeing in the region timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so i think the i was probably pretty clear the additional projects we re looking at in north america and asia and it would envision in asia a new a large new plant and in north america i think we probably could consider perhaps a new plant and perhaps a line addition or the existing plant and i would tell you ghansham it s certainly not underspending in any regard and i wouldn t pollute the discussion with post signode i think what signode has afforded us is the opportunity to spend the cash flow and signode we can come back to signode but the cash provided by signode affords us to spend more money i wouldn t say that we ve underspent in the past i d say that we ve been we ve tried to be extremely disciplined in a market that up until 2019 had shown no growth to negative growth for 15 years prior so we re in a market right now that for the first time in 15 years has shown growth and ok i think we re going to see growth again in 2020 and we ll probably see it in 21 and 22 so we are now prepared to expand capacity but prior to 2019 i think it would have been fairly reckless to throw a whole lot of capacity of market in a market that up until now hasn t shown any real growth so certainly not underspending it has nothing to do with signode it s just a reflection of a market and our customers and consumers alike demanding more from beverage cans than they have in the past ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst very clear and then for my second question i guess the 0 40 increase in eps between 2020 and 2019 using the midpoint of your 2020 guidance how does that break down from a high level bridge standpoint operating income and then pension and whatever else you want to call out thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer hey ghansham so on an after tax basis we ll pick up let s say 0 15 or 0 18 on lower interest costs we have we ll pick up about a few cents on pension that s not real material minority will be about flat and we re actually compared to where we ended up on this year s tax rate tax is a bit of a drag if you take the midpoint of the 24 25 so let s say a 5 drag there and then the rest flows through operating income timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer ghansham just to summarize i think in the prepared remarks by segment we said the americas beverage business would have higher segment income although not to the 80 million higher like we had in 19 european beverage will be up over 19 as well although q1 will be flattish to slightly down because of the seville conversion in total european food will be flat asia pacific flat and transit up about 10 million to 15 million on the year non reportables down just on the steel repricing that we won t recover as we go through the year so all putting all that together segment income up over the prior year in total ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst okay thanks so much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you are welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of anthony pettinari from citigroup anthony your line is now open anthony pettinari citigroup analyst good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning anthony pettinari citigroup analyst tim have you seen or does your 1q guidance assume any impact to transit or asia pac bev from the coronavirus disruptions and i understand you don t have a huge direct china exposure but are you seeing any knock on effects maybe with transit customers supply chains timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so the transit business has a very small i think we have 20 million of revenues in china so it s not a factor if anything if there was a prolonged shutdown and we ll talk about that in a second in china you would expect manufacturing activity in other markets to pick up to offset lower chinese exports and perhaps we would see some benefit of that given that we re almost non existent from a transit perspective in china in beverage we are on mandatory shutdown right now as i ve heard other companies describe this they make it sound like they re voluntarily shutting down just so you know beijing coming out of the chinese new year beijing had a mandatory shutdown through february 2 and almost every other province extended the mandatory shutdown except for critical industries through february 10 so the three beverage can plants are on mandatory shutdown and we ll reopen next monday unless they extend the shutdown we don t have a very big beverage business in china as we described to you before it s about 95 million in sales and certainly we re expecting a lower income this year so we don t expect any significant and we haven t budgeted anything significant for coronavirus and we ll see how it manifest itself going forward anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s helpful and then there are a few moving pieces in terms of new projects coming online and projects from last year that are ramping up i was wondering if you could provide any commentary on the level of start up costs you anticipate for 1q and then maybe for the full year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so i would we always i always say when we talk about asia we always have a number of projects so the start up costs are somewhat equal to the start up costs in prior years but i think we will see a little headwind in americas beverage in q1 just from the start up of weston and the preproduction costs in nichols line 3 in q1 rio verde is blowing right through their learning curve so i don t expect that to have much of an impact we like others if we could have the brazil experience everywhere we d be phenomenal i don t we ll have european beverage as i discussed civil which is a very large two line plant we will not be making cans in q1 because the conversion is being completed we probably begin making cans on the one line at the end of march and the other line in early april so we had some pre production there but the workforce is an experienced can workforce and aluminum cans are easier to make than steel cans so i expect them to come through learning curve fairly rapidly in q2 but really americas beverage a little bit with weston and nichols nothing else anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of debbie jones from deutsche bank debbie your line is now open debbie jones deutsche bank analyst hey good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning debbie debbie jones deutsche bank analyst i wanted to ask about where and we know a lot of this growth is coming on the back of sustainability but as you have these conversations with your customers is the ask for the can or is it for the standard can where do you think people really want to see the can go from here and i guess the reason i m asking is if you think about like some of your longer term customers that have been in standard cans as they grow with you and as you maybe add new capacity for them what do they prefer going forward timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer it s a great question i think real quick for the for some of the newer customers the newer products we re seeing that in slimmer sleek cans and some 16 ounce formats for the existing customers i think it s both i think they re they are dealing the big who the existing big customers are they are dealing with a number of jurisdictions nationwide which are pushing back on one way plastic packaging and they are certainly looking to gain more shelf space and sell more of their product and they re looking to do it across a number of formats so they are ramping up the promotions of sleek and slim but at the same time from a sustainability standpoint we re seeing more demand for 12 ounce standard as well debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay and then i wanted to ask specifically on europe if we could exclude the middle east you mentioned broadly speaking several years of growth is that your expectation specifically in europe and is that just a sustainability story or are there other things driving that as well timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so you re right i think the middle east good to exclude it because it s probably flatter demand the region will grow but our profile will be flatter we expect european beverage again as you say to continue to grow and the market i think the market tom you have the number here just as a reference point just bear with me i ll tell you what we think the market did it s a good jumping off point i think we think the market in europe was up 4 to 5 both in the fourth quarter and for the full year and i think that s not an unreasonable level of growth we expect over the next several years for the market in total which requires on a full output basis one to 1 5 can lines per year so and i don t expect that to subside i think we re going to continue to see growth in european beverage as i said in my prepared remarks however we have 600 million of capital is a big number for us and that will be dedicated to markets where we believe the return profile is more favorable right now the european beverage return profile needs to improve it s a very healthy market and it will grow but we ll wait to see the return profile grow before we throw any more capital at that market currently debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay thank you i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes the line of adam josephson from keybanc capital markets adam your line is now open adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tim and tom good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning adam timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning adam adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tim on transit packaging you talked in your prepared remarks about just how much cash it generated last year and then in the q a you talked about how it s enabling you it s funding a lot of the beverage can expansion that you re doing and when you bought the business when you announced the acquisition a couple of years ago you said much the same thing that look this generates a lot of cash much more so as a percentage of ebitda than the rest of our business there are some investors out there who obviously think that it doesn t have a place in the portfolio and that it s dragging down the multiple at which you trade obviously you re saying on this call it s generating a ton of cash and it s doing what we wanted it to do so can you just talk about that perception that among some that it s dragging down your multiple it doesn t belong in the portfolio etc timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re also a clever guy you re trying to get me to talk about the board process before we re prepared to do it so what i would say and i think i was as george said i was pretty candid on european food where we have not done a very good job managing the business i would say just the opposite in transit the transit team has done an exceptional job managing the business within the scope of a manufacturing environment across a number of end markets whether it s auto steel white goods etc which are down and i think the ebitda in 19 adjusted for currency is we did in 4 or 5 of what we bought in 2017 and the cash flow as you note and as we ve said is extremely high so we ve described this business in the past as a conversion cash conversion business in the 90 range and that s basically ebitda minus capex divided by ebitda and what the business accomplished this year is even well beyond that they re free cash flow unlevered so considering capex considering taxes considering working capital well above 100 of its ebitda so the market has a view of whether the business belongs in the portfolio or not the board is looking at that the board is looking at a number of things and there are other packaging companies be they food can companies or beverage can companies but also have other assets and we like they to separate those businesses we re trying to review how much leakage there is and before we entertain the prospect of what a single line beverage can company multiple might trade for in the future the first thing in creating value is not destroying value and i think that s something the management team is working closely with the board on right now and as i said i think it s probably premature for me to comment any further adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst just one other question along those lines tim you have slower growing businesses that generate a disproportionate percentage of your cash flow so are you of the mind that if you rid yourself of these really good cash flow businesses and become a more capital intensive company you would for whatever reason trade at a higher multiple even though your capital intensity is much greater timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i don t know listen adam i don t know what the multiple will be it might be a higher multiple today what i said earlier at this point in time what will it be in two years while we re on the topic i refer to you as the what do i call him no the dark the prince of darkness so you re a bit more negative on this space and across all of the packaging space than others and we re very positive on the outlook for beverage cans globally but it does take cash to fund the beverage business now in time perhaps the growth in beverage cans three or four years will slow down and we ll start to harvest more of the cash out of the beverage business but for now we need to feed the beverage business to grow it and i think if we want to you want to trade assets for a point in time beverage multiple that s one thing i think as we said it s premature to talk about but we re trying to understand the process of creating value and that first means don t destroy value in the near term adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst yeah understood and just one on your transit packaging ebit guidance for 20 i think you said it was it would be up 10 million to 15 million how much of that is just driven by the inventory reductions at year end versus whatever market outlook you have i assume you re not expecting manufacturing activity globally to get too much better in 2020 so i m just trying to separate the pieces there timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i think if you look at the economic indicators and the and some of the economic forecast that are out there by a number of the large banks including your own they point to the back half of the year perhaps economic activity kind of stabilizes and maybe we see a slight pickup so and then certainly our comps get easier in the back half of the year so perhaps on a comparable basis a little soft in the first half and stronger in the back half but up 10 million to 15 million overall so but the the team has done an exceptionally good job and in reducing the inventory and not only that but they have plans that are well advanced to reduce overall costs so i think we re certainly more bullish on the outlook for the income performance than you would be from the outside not understanding the business adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst sure thanks a lot tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you are welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tyler langton from jpmorgan tyler your line is now open tyler langton jp morgan analyst hey good morning tim and tom thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning tyler langton jp morgan analyst i just had a question i think you said in europe you kind of your bev you mean volumes and growth sort of 4 to 5 in sort of this year with the market i guess the question is if you hold off on investing in new capacity i guess sort of given what you ve sort of installed so far i mean when you look to sort of 2021 would you not be able to sort of grow at that sort of mid single digit rate and i guess how do you think about sort of bad and sort of the potentially losing share versus sort of higher returns timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer it s possible that if we don t invest and if the market keeps growing and others invest we ll lose a little bit of share but i think i d rather see us raise price and raise the margin profile than just invest for the sake of share and that s my message to the team and hopefully that s their message to the customers in their markets that if you want us to invest to support your growth plans and your sustainability plans we need to have a better return profile in that market tyler langton jp morgan analyst okay that s helpful and then i guess tom could you just give a little bit on the for free cash flow to some of the other components assumptions like working capital pension restructuring thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer for 2020 tyler langton jp morgan analyst yeah versus 2019 thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah the cash pension should be similar at 15 million to 20 million the real moving piece is capex obviously we talked about that but beyond that working capital was we had some benefit in 2019 let s say 20 million to 30 million in 2020 we expect a drag as we build up the beverage can capacity we ll need increased working capital to support the growth so we re probably looking at a drag of about 75 million in working capital in 2020 but we ll try to do better than that tyler langton jp morgan analyst great thanks so much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets arun your line is now open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning i guess first off i don t think there s many questions on the guidance so just getting your thoughts on the range that you provided it seems like a pretty tight range i guess are we to assume that fx maybe isn t as impactful as a factor in 2020 and similarly many of the other factors around beverage can growth transit and european food are dialed in or how are you thinking about the range that you provided on eps thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well it s a arun it s a 0 20 range i think we ve typically provided a 0 20 range it s kind of hard to provide you with anything greater than that without you having any level of comfort or are we having any comfort in what we re doing currency as we sit here today currency should be much more muted the impact in 20 versus 19 than it was in 19 versus 18 tom described pension it s a few cents benefit in 20 as opposed to a large headwind in 19 i think we ve described on the call here pretty much in detail what we think each of the segments is what we believe at this point each of the segments is going to accomplish in terms of its segment s income anything could happen but i think as we sit here today it s kind of the range we feel comfortable with we don t want to start forecasting for what we don t know so for what we do know that s kind of where we re at arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay that s fair and then just on the portfolio review i guess i understand the notion that both your food can and signode businesses do provide quite a bit of cash flow and would agree with that i guess i m just again curious just there has been some transactions within food can does the board process look into is the board process examining potential transactions as well as this part of this review and would there be a scenario where you could do something creative whether it be jvs or selling a portion of either business thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think you should expect and i think we ve said it that the review is comprehensive i ll just leave it at that kristal i think we are ready for the next question operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike leithead from barclays mike your line is now open michael leithead barclays analyst thanks good morning guys timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning michael leithead barclays analyst i guess higher level question on the overall beverage can market i appreciate the market s growing very rapidly today and you and your major competitors are investing to fill this demand but i guess when you re going through your capital approval process how do you get comfortable with the risk that market demand doesn t continue at this new outsized rate and kind of reverts back to the no growth longer term trend line and we re stuck with overcapacity again i mean i guess just how do you think about the risk reward there timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you for asking that it s the question we always wrestle with it s i think in response to ghansham s question earlier what i tried to say was that the additional spending in 2020 the forecast in spending in no way is a reflection that we underspent in the past it s a reflection that the market and the growth in the market that was negative did not warrant any spending so what we see today is growth and i think we foresee in north america growth for the next couple of years and fortunately for us we are positioning ourselves where we are underweight in specialty cans to becoming more in line with the market in specialty so we have an opportunity to spend in that regard as well and i don t want to say without regard but alongside the market growth we are more appropriate aligning ourselves in the north american market with the specialty can growth in the market as opposed to the rest of the world where we are at market levels or even higher on specialty can as proportion of our sales and then the additional spending in asia that market continues to grow and so that s never going to an issue but your question is the right question and i think for the next couple of years as we ve said mike we think growth is going to be very favorable especially in light of recent growth or negative growth trends but 19 we had growth and that was the first year of growth in a long time and we ll have it in 20 and 21 it s and as i ve said in the past and hopefully we re all somewhat responsible here michael leithead barclays analyst got it that s helpful and then just on the strategic review process i appreciate there s nothing you re going to report at this time but just in regards to timing is there a rough time frame you re targeting to wrap up this formalized process by and would you anticipate making an announcement even if the result of the board review is no change to the overall portfolio timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think when we made the initial announcement we talked about a number of things we talked about capital allocation we talked about portfolio review and we talked about refreshing the board of directors so the board the initial board refreshment has occurred board members retire from time to time and that s an ongoing process i think you should expect that whatever the outcome of the portfolio review is that the board will publicly report its conclusions and i would suggest to you that it s probably regardless of the rumors in the marketplace it s probably more appropriate that you expect that to be some time in the april to late april time frame michael leithead barclays analyst got it thank you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian maguire of goldman sachs brian your line is now open brian maguire goldman sachs analyst hey good morning guys timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning brian maguire goldman sachs analyst i just wanted to come back to the 600 million capex guidance should we assume that if the two to four unnamed projects don t materialize or go forward then the capex number could be materially below the 600 million and sort of related to that tom what do you think is the right capex level beyond 2020 timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think if the projects we re discussing don t materialize then yes we would be back in the 430 million to 450 million range i think we re pretty comfortable that we re that they re going to materialize we re just not prepared to tell you right now we ll probably be prepared to tell you in april a lot more so i think you should for your modeling purposes you should conclude that we re going to be closer to the 600 million number because i think we re going to be successful and we ll come back and tell you in a couple of months here what we re doing what s an appropriate amount of capital for a growing business that s a great question i think if the business continues to grow we ll continue to feed the needs of the business if the business the growth slows down then we ll slow the capital down i don t think it this isn t a government budget where we spend our budget every year we try to start every year understanding our base maintenance needs and then from there you build on growth so but that s where we re at right now brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay and in the last couple of months there was a news of sort of a new entrant into the continental us market in florida just wondering if you had any thoughts on that and just kind of in general you talked about barriers to entry when you talked about your capex spending earlier can you just talk about how you see those barriers and whether or whether you think that all the growth that we re seeing in the capital flowing into the industry could start to attract others or not timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well there s a lot of growth there s a lot of positive momentum around the sustainability argument there s a lot of money available out at very cheap rates so anybody is capable to do anything you hate to comment on speculation i don t see the new factory in florida having a big impact on the north american market i think a lot of those cans are going to be headed back into the caribbean we ll see what they do with that factory going forward we re not we don t have manufacturing in the florida market so it doesn t directly impact us but everything impacts you indirectly over time others may come to the market but as i said i hate to speculate on that because i don t know i think i do think there s enough growth right now to absorb what we and the others are doing and i think our footprints we and the existing can makers we have national footprints and we re better able to service the needs of national and regional customers than somebody that comes in with one or two plants in a region brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay last one for me just a quick one i know it s not your biggest market but vietnam they put in a pretty strict dwi law at the start of the year i ve seen some reports that beer consumption is down 25 or so in that market is that something that you re seeing play out and is that part of the sort of flat ebit guidance in asia this year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so i think what you just said you need to tell everybody around the world and they should expect that and they shouldn t come to vietnam with any more can capacity i agree now honestly we ve seen no impact of what you just described in the vietnamese market it is a it continues to be a rapidly growing market the beer industry is dominated by two principal beer companies there one is currently 80 in cans 20 in glass the other is just the reverse 20 in glass or 20 in cans 80 in glass so a growing market a growing middle class an extremely well educated population closing on 100 million people the flat performance we re describing in asia has nothing to do with vietnam it has to do with china so vietnam i saw one of the comments earlier today in one of the pre call reports but we ve not seen any impact from that law brian maguire goldman sachs analyst great thanks very much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of neel kumar from morgan stanley neel your line is now open neel kumar morgan stanley analyst great thanks for taking my question i think you mentioned low double digit volume growth in north america what allowed you to realize growth in north america in the fourth quarter given the capacity constraints you ve been facing and you re only bringing on the new line on weston last month timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well it s typically a very low quarter for can so in the second and third quarter we are oversold as a company and an industry you build cans in the first quarter sometimes you even build them in the fourth quarter into the first quarter for sale on the second and third quarter so just being a lower demand quarter you have more cans available to sell in the fourth quarter it s just math neel kumar morgan stanley analyst okay all right that s helpful and then just a follow up on your comments on the european beverage return profile is that comment specifically referring to your 12 ounce cans and then given that you had a similar issue in the past in the us and then started getting price increases in 2019 you think you could see similar movement in europe given the tight supply and demand environment and i mean do you have any contracts up for renewal in the near term in europe timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well there s always contracts that are up for renewal there s always contracts that will roll over i won t say anything else commercially other than that the team has been tasked with the job of improving the margins and until we see margin improvement we re looking at behaving similar to how we behaved in north america pre 2018 2019 as it relates to capacity i would love to see the margin profile improve i think it whether we re talking about 12 ounce or 33 centiliter 50 centiliter or slim and sleek cans in 15 20 and 25 centiliter it s an overall market return profile that needs to be improved neel kumar morgan stanley analyst all right that s helpful thank you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark wilde of bmo capital markets mark your line is now open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst yeah tim just a couple of quick follow ons one i wondered if you could talk about what you re seeing in both brazil and colombia with brazil i m just kind of curious we ve got abi building their first can plant there and i know in colombia you ve felt the impact from canpack coming in and then the second thing i wondered if you could talk about is just sort of generally what you have seen come out of these renegotiations in north america i know there were a lot of can contracts that repriced at the start of this year i think it would be helpful to all of us if we had some understanding of kind of where you were getting price versus just where you were getting like terms or the ability to pass other costs through timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah mark on your second question i m going to allow you to ask that question tomorrow you re going to get a chance to ask that tomorrow and we ll see if they want to answer it but frankly i don t want to answer that i don t see any advantage to answering that on the first question yeah we lost a significant chunk of business in colombia a competitor came into the market and we described that in the third quarter it s we ll cycle through that q3 q4 of 19 q1 and q2 of 20 and then we re back on our way but the business is rebuilding itself with other customers notably the partner we have there who fills cans and distributes can beverages both beer and soft drinks in brazil the market continues to grow and again just to i should have kept my finger on it but here we are our estimate is that the industry grew at about 14 in 2019 over 18 and we were up 4 just because of capacity now we were up 8 in q4 and we ll be up a lot more in 2020 just because the capacity came on i think there s enough growth in the market that it s going to absorb the new plant that you described as well as the new capacity we put in in any other marginal capacity anybody else puts in it s a it continues to be an exciting market for beverage cans mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst so just tim in just rough terms and you re really talking about a market that grew by something like 4 billion cans last year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst all right thanks very much good luck for the rest of the year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome okay kristal i think thank you very much kristal i think that concludes the call today and we look forward to speaking with you all again in april thank you very much operator duration
