by on january 15 the us president donald trump and chinese vice premier liu he signed a phase one trade agreement to de escalate an 18 month trade war between the world s two biggest economies after months of tough negotiations and retaliatory trade actions both countries agreed to proceed ahead with the phase one trade agreement the core elements of the phase one trade agreement include intellectual property technology transfer agriculture financial services currency and exchange rate policies besides the deal establishes a bilateral dispute resolution arrangement to resolve any disputes on matters listed in the agreement the full text of the agreement is available here in his opening remarks at the signing ceremony held at the east room of the white house president trump stated today we take a momentous step one that has never been taken before with china toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade as we sign phase one of the historic trade deal between the united states and china together we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for american workers farmers and families the chinese leader xi jinping also welcomed the deal and described it as good for china the us and the whole world a symbolic deal president trump is selling this deal as a historic and would use it to boost his re election bid later this year trump hopes that this agreement will shore up his political base ahead of the 2020 elections as rural america a large segment of his base was severely hit by retaliatory tariffs imposed by china on soybeans and other agricultural products on the other hand the deal brings welcome relief to china it gives breathing space to xi jinping to deal with the daunting economic slowdown as well as hong kong protests in 2019 china s economy grew 6 1 percent the lowest since 1990 one big challenge for china is to contain financial risks that are fast accumulating in its financial system while maintaining high quality growth the trade deal gives the chinese government some space to redouble on its efforts to address current economic challenges the phase one agreement is not a free trade agreement by any means nor will it end the trade war between the us and china despite the agreement both trading partners have decided to maintain the bulk of the tariffs that were imposed on each other s products during the trade war the agreement keeps in place 370 bn in tariffs on chinese imports as well as beijing s retaliatory tariffs of course a lot would depend on the actual implementation of the agreement that will take some time given the lack of mutual trust and intense geopolitical rivalry between the two giants nothing momentous the phase one trade deal lacks much substance and leaves too many questions unanswered it may be too early to make a final assessment of the 94 page agreement but a cursory examination indicates that china has made no significant concessions to the us that would represent a historic deal for the trump administration the deal is limited in scope as it proposes modest changes in the areas of intellectual property technology transfer and market access to the chinese financial sector further most commitments outlined in the agreement have already been made by china unilaterally or at international forums such as g20 and wto for instance the deal requires china to fully comply with its wto agriculture commitments and rulings on agriculture subsidies and quotas china has already decided not to appeal the wto panel s decisions and agreed to abide by the rulings broadly speaking the deal is a repackaging of previously announced commitments by china to open up its domestic markets and in line with its move towards establishing a more market based economy in fact the chinese authorities view several concessions in the areas of intellectual property financial services and currency management as beneficial to the country s economic development and its expanded presence in the global economy some analysts point out that far from bringing the chinese to their knees china could end up being a bigger surprise winner of the deal in the long term the phase one trade deal falls far short of drastic policy changes and wide ranging deep reforms sought by the trump administration when it launched a trade war with china in 2018 for instance the deal does not address issues such as dismantling of industrial subsidies and the reduced role of state owned companies in the chinese economy nor does it address cybersecurity issues what the us characterized as chinese government conducted sponsored and tolerated cyber theft a thorny issue that ostensibly triggered the trade war after months of negotiations and imposition of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of chinese imports the us has not achieved several of its stated objectives the us intends to begin negotiations on such thorny structural issues in the next phase two of the deal but it is yet unclear when these negotiations will start and whether china will fundamentally restructure its economic model to appease the us china may likely wait until this year s presidential elections in the us before joining negotiations on the phase two of the trade deal below is a brief analysis of some of the key elements of the phase one trade agreement intellectual property the intellectual property ip chapter covers several issues including trade secrets pharmaceutical related intellectual property patents geographical indications trademarks and enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods the agreement proposes no substantive changes in china s current ip regime except that china has agreed to establish a mechanism for the early resolution of drug related patent disputes and to provide patent term extensions to compensate for unreasonable delays in the patent office or drug approval processes on its own china was going to implement some of the commitments made under the ip chapter but the trade war with the us delayed the process the agreement states within 30 working days after the date of entry into force of this agreement china will promulgate an action plan to strengthen intellectual property protection any observer of china s ip regime would attest that over the past two decades china has steadily strengthened the protection of iprs in pursuit of its self interest as well as to meet its international commitments under the wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips not only china has promulgated strict ipr laws in the last two years but it has also strengthened the enforcement processes as the country is climbing up the technological ladder it is worth remembering that china wants to develop as a hub for high tech manufacturing and advanced r d china sees its future in the innovation led economy and creating new high value added products and services supported by a strict ipr regime that s why china has been moving its ipr regime closer to other developed countries technology transfer the technology transfer chapter deals with obligations to ban forced technology transfers in china although beijing has denied carryout out such practices the us and many developed countries often accuse china of putting pressure on foreign firms to transfer their technology to domestic firms as a condition for obtaining market access or administrative approvals the agreement states neither party shall require or pressure persons of the other party to transfer technology to its persons in relation to acquisitions joint ventures or other investment transactions any transfer or licensing of technology between persons of a party and those of the other party must be based on market terms that are voluntary and reflect mutual agreement much before this deal china had already undertaken legal measures to ban forced technology transfers in march 2019 china adopted a foreign investment law fil that replaces three existing laws governing foreign direct investment in the country the unified fil explicitly bans the forced transfer of technologies through administrative means came in effect from january 1 2020 the fil stipulates the conditions for technology cooperation shall be determined by all investment parties upon equal negotiations under the principle of fairness and no administrative department or its staff shall force any transfer of technology by administrative means further the fil also imposes penalties on chinese officials if they force foreign firms to transfer their technology to domestic entities expanding trade perhaps the biggest surprise of the phase one agreement is china s commitment to buy an additional 200 bn worth of us goods and services over a two year period january 2020 december 2021 it includes 77 7 bn of manufactured goods 32 bn of agricultural products 52 4 bn of energy and 37 9 bn of services even though this commitment is meant only for two years it raises four key concerns first the numbers are highly ambitious especially for agricultural products and one wonders whether the us exporters can deliver without diverting exports from other countries second many of these us exports will still be subject to retaliatory tariffs imposed by china during the trade war and therefore will be relatively more expensive third can china force its privately owned domestic firms to buy products from the us instead of from other trading partners with whom it has signed free trade agreements fourth aren t such managed trade practices a violation of the wto rules financial services another core element of the trade agreement is the commitments made by china to open up its financial services sector to the us banks insurance companies asset management companies credit rating agencies and credit card companies and thereby allowing us financial institutions to establish wholly owned entities in the country following are some of the major commitments made by china with specific timelines under the agreement china shall allow u s financial services suppliers to apply for asset management company licenses that would permit them to acquire non performing loans directly from chinese banks beginning with provincial licenses when additional national licenses are granted china shall treat u s financial services suppliers on a non discriminatory basis with chinese suppliers including with respect to the granting of such licenses no later than april 1 2020 china shall remove the foreign equity cap in the life pension and health insurance sectors and allow wholly u s owned insurance companies to participate in these sectors no later than april 1 2020 china shall eliminate foreign equity limits and allow wholly u s owned services suppliers to participate in the securities fund management and futures sectors china shall allow u s financial services suppliers to apply for asset management company licenses that would permit them to acquire non performing loans directly from chinese banks beginning with provincial licenses although the chinese authorities had already announced some of these commitments in 2019 the phase one trade agreement has brought forward the planned opening of the chinese financial services sector from december 2020 to april 2020 for the us based financial firms unlike most other chapters the agreement calls for a two way opening of the financial service sector in return the us has also agreed to rapidly process applications by chinese banks insurance firms and securities firms to enter and operate in the us markets however there is a much broader policy issue involved here as financial liberalization can pose risks to financial system stability in china the chinese government s intention to further open up the financial sector is to spur more innovation and greater competition but a more cautious approach is warranted as financial risks are building up in china s financial system china s non financial corporate debt government debt non performing loans and opaque shadow banking sector pose potential risks to financial stability the recent bailouts of three regional banks have exposed the vulnerabilities in the chinese banking sector therefore it is in china s interest to adopt a gradual liberalization approach on financial services to avoid the financial crises experienced by other emerging market economies that adopted rapid financial liberalization exchange rate policy in august 2019 the us treasury department labeled china a currency manipulator but it formally removed china s designation as a currency manipulator just two days before signing the trade deal the phase one trade agreement contains a two page chapter on macroeconomic policies and exchange rate matters this chapter includes several provisions reaffirming both countries existing g20 and imf commitments to refrain from competitive devaluations and to avoid manipulating exchange rates in addition the us and china countries have agreed to publicly disclose data on foreign exchange reserves and external balances nothing newsworthy as both countries regularly put such data in the public domain the chapter also contains an enforcement mechanism if any country fails to adhere to the commitments on exchange rate policies or transparency by and large the currency management provisions of the us china deal are less substantive than the new united states mexico canada agreement usmca for instance the usmca requires member countries to regularly disclose the monthly interventions in both the spot and forward foreign exchange markets and in no way the phase one deal resembles the 1985 plaza accord that radically weakened the us dollar and strengthened the japanese yen to conclude the phase one trade agreement between the us and china signals a pause in the ongoing trade war but not much more
overview the new coronavirus in china has moved into the vacuum left by the us china trade agreement and clear indications that the bank of japan the european central bank and the federal reserve are on hold as investors searched for new drivers the world health organization refrained from calling it a public health emergency even though china has dramatically stepped up its efforts to contain the new virus many asian markets are closed for the lunar new year but equities japan hong kong australia and india eked out small gains europe s dow jones stoxx 600 jumped 1 25 its biggest increase since mid december if sustained helped by preliminary pmi readings that lend credence to arguments that the worst may be behind the eurozone it is recouping the losses of the last four sessions and is turning higher for the week it would be the sixth weekly advance in the past seven us shares are also trading firmer after a strong recovery yesterday the s p 500 appears poised to gap higher at the opening again buying on the dip strategy is being rewarded rising stocks sap the demand for bonds and benchmark yields are 1 2 basis points higher in europe and the us fading speculation of a bank of england rate cut helped lift sterling to near three week highs 1 3175 before the rally fizzled the euro remains pinned near seven week lows seen yesterday 1 1035 more broadly the us dollar is little changed against the major currencies on the day while holding on to weekly gains against most but sterling and the yen emerging market currencies are firm with the jp morgan emerging market currency index is steady to higher but is off about 0 35 on the week gold is a little heavy but is fairly flat with this week s settlements in a tight range between 1558 and 1562 march wti has stabilized after falling more than 5 over the past three sessions asia pacific china has stepped up its efforts to contain the new coronavirus travel for some 40 mln people has been restricted covering at least ten cities incidents have now been reported in 32 of 34 provinces china appears to be responding in a more transparent way than the experience with sars in the early 2000s market participants are already turning their attention to the possible economic fallout the sars crisis saw chinese gdp fall by around two percentage points toward the end of next week after chinese returns from the lunar new year it will report the official pmi the contagion is expected to hit services harder than manufacturing it will also add to the typical distortion of the data at the start of the calendar year the underlying slowing of the chinese economy the continued protests in hk the recent election results in taiwan and now this virus are surely testing the leadership of president xi japan reported december cpi figures and the preliminary january pmi japan s inflation ticked up with the headline reaching 0 8 an eight month high the core measure which excludes fresh food rose from 0 5 to 0 7 the increase appears to reflect the sales tax increase the pmi reflected an economy rebounding after the sales tax and typhoons the composite pmi rose to 51 1 from 48 6 a five month high while manufacturing remains below the 50 boom bust level at 49 3 the pace of contraction moderated from 48 4 in december the service pmi rose to 52 1 from 49 9 the dollar is virtually flat against the yen today jpy109 50 it has hardly moved more than 10 ticks away from jpy109 55 the technical indicators have turned lower for the dollar but this does not preclude a retest of the jpy110 area early next week support is seen near jpy109 30 the australian dollar has risen in three sessions so far this year and yesterday s 0 0 4 gain was one of them on the week the aussie is off about 0 6 it is the fourth consecutive weekly decline the price action warns that a low is probably not in place and near term potential extends toward 0 6800 the onshore yuan market is closed but in the offshore market the yuan cnh has softened a little to bring this week s loss to a little more than 1 the largest decline since last september europe the eurozone economy seems to be on the mend and although the dovish spin to lagarde s comments yesterday seemed to be more about trying to explain the price action i e the euro s losses rather than arguably a robust understanding of what she said in fact she recognized a modest improvement in underlying inflation and continued to expand on the idea that while downside risks remain they have diminished germany s flash pmi was better than expected but the strikes in france weighed on the service sector and was a drag on the aggregate reading germany s manufacturing pmi rose to 45 2 from 43 7 while still obviously below 50 it is at its best level in 11 months and has edged higher in three of the past four months the service sector remains resilient and improved to 54 2 from 52 9 the composite rose to a five month high of 51 1 from 50 2 new business grew for the first time in seven months and manufacturing orders saw the smallest decline in 15 months the french manufacturing pmi rose to 51 0 from 50 4 but the service pmi fell to 51 7 from 52 4 and was a larger decline than expected the composite pmi eased to 51 5 from 52 0 the emu aggregate manufacturing pmi rose to 47 8 from 46 3 it is the highest since last april the service pmi fell to 52 2 from 52 8 this left the emu composite reading unchanged at 50 9 the strength of the uk pmi pushed the market further in the direction it was going and that as to downgrade the chances of a rate cut next week the manufacturing pmi rose to 49 8 from 47 5 and the service pmi improved to 52 9 form 50 0 this succeeded in lifting the composite to 52 4 from 49 3 which is the strongest since september 2018 at the end of last week the derivatives market discounted about a 70 chance of a cut next week the odds had fallen to a little more than 60 as of yesterday and today the odds are around 50 50 however the euro and sterling have been unable to sustain even modest upticks today the euro is making new lows since early december and appears to be headed for a test of last november lows in the 1 0980 area this will be the fourth consecutive weekly loss for the euro which finished last year a little above 1 12 sterling initially moved above yesterday s highs but has reversed lower to take out yesterday s lows technically it could be a key reversal and a close below yesterday s low 1 3100 would give a decidedly negative tone to start the new week initial support is seen near 1 3030 1 3050 there are two option expires of note for sterling today one if for a little more than gbp585 mln at 1 31 and the other is for gbp510 mln at 1 3150 america the us sees its flash january pmi it is expected to be little changed from the december readings which put the manufacturing sector at 52 4 and the service sector at 52 8 the composite stood at 52 7 in december the highest since last april the fomc holds its first meeting of the new year next week and it should be without much fanfare the first estimate of q4 gdp will also be a highlight the atlanta and ny fed gdp trackers have growth below 2 at an annualized pace and bank forecasts appear a little higher than the trackers in canada retail sales in november are expected to recover from the unexpectedly sharp decline in october sales 1 2 economists forecast that half of the loss was recouped at the headline level and nearly completely offset when autos are excluded mexico reports monthly economic indicator for november it has fallen in five of the six months through october however the economy appears to have bounced back and the median forecast in the bloomberg survey is for a 0 45 reading which would be the strongest since may 2018 follow through buying of the canadian dollar has been limited after yesterday s upside reversal demand for us dollars re emerged near cad1 3120 the intraday technicals are stretched for the us dollar and chart resistance is seen near cad1 3160 that said there is a 625 mln option at cad1 3150 that expires today the greenback has gained about 0 5 against the mexican peso this week the high yields offset the domestic policy risks to attract financial flows the dollar did spike to around mxn18 85 yesterday and briefly traded above the 20 day moving average for the first time in a couple of weeks however the dollar was sold into the bounce and it finished below mxn18 80
nowadays globalization has many critics on both sides of the aisle on the right it seems that advocates for global markets have lost some ground to populists and nationalists over the past few years on the left however things are less clear while presidential candidates like warren and sanders have decried both america s trade deals and the influence of multinational corporations support for trade and immigration among democratic voters has never been higher than it s been throughout the trump administration to explore this dichotomy and to hear the progressive case for globalization i spoke last week with kimberly clausing on political economy kim is the thormund miller and walter mintz professor of economics at reed college where she studies international trade international and public finance and the taxation of multinational firms she has worked on economic policy research with the international monetary fund the hamilton project the brookings institution and the tax policy center she is also the author of open the progressive case for free trade immigration and global capital what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation you can download the episode here and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review pethokoukis how is the progressive case for free trade immigration and global capital different from the ordinary case are there substantive differences clausing i think what s different about this argument is that it s not based solely around the efficiency criteria so we often think of trade immigration and global capital as helping markets function better and be more efficient growing gdp overall and what i m arguing in this book is that not only is that case quite strong which it is but even if you just care about things like equity and the well being of the middle class and typical workers and the poor at first glance free trade immigration and global capital are also good for those aims but i would caution that all of the methods of economic integration do run the risk of harming some people and so another argument that i m making in this book is that it s important to accompany those global open policies with attention to redistribution and the larger social policy context so that sort of initial case the efficiency case the this will boost gdp case do you disagree with any of that or is the problem that a lot of people a lot of economists don t get much beyond that case they think that once you ve made that case you don t have to say any more because that should overpower any objections i agree with the efficiency case and i think for the most part these types of global economic integration are really good for the economy as a whole but i don t shy away from noticing that there are big groups in the economy that aren t really feeling that the rising tide is lifting all boats what i caution against is blaming trade and immigration for that feeling i do think that there are groups of people who have been hurt by international trade for instance but there are a lot of elements in our capitalist economy that create job churn disruption and income inequality and my argument is that those are things that we should deal with directly rather than by hoping that restricting trade or restricting immigration will get at some secondary effects that cause inequality i argue that restricting trade and immigration in response to american workers concerns would make their situation worse if all i knew about what progressives folks on the left and democrats think about trade was what i learned from watching the democratic presidential debates i would say that you had a very heavy lift with this book because to the extent that any of these issues come up it s pretty negative true democrats tend not to like the president s trade agenda but it seems like there s not much they ve liked about america s trade agenda for a long time you really don t hear much good about the pacific trade deal which we elected not to participate in they don t like nafta they think that was a failure south bend mayor pete buttigieg senator elizabeth warren former vice president joe biden and senator bernie sanders arrive onstage during the u s democratic presidential candidates debate at the tyler perry studios in atlanta georgia u s november 20 2019 via reuters so if all i knew was from those debates it would sound like american trade policy has been an abject failure for decades it s been terrible for workers and the middle class just an ultimate failure you re saying that s wrong i m saying that s wrong and i think that s an error that both sides make certainly president trump in his campaign and presidency has echoed those same themes and so interestingly while this is often cast as a democrats vs republicans issue i think this is really a centrist vs extremes issue we tend to think of the political spectrum as lining up from small government to big government or from market friendly to market hostile but there s another dimension open vs closed i think that dimension creates some different bedfellows than the other dimension in the sense that you see the far left and far right agreeing on more isolationist and nationalist economic policy aims whereas there are people in the middle in recent administrations you can point to people in the clinton bush and obama administrations that share a friendlier attitude towards trade and immigration they recognize its potential for good for both the united states workers and of course the world so just to take nafta which comes up in these debates and the president has sort of reworked and renegotiated do you think nafta was not the worst trade deal in american history i think there s very little evidence that nafta has anything to do with the vast majority of concerns felt by the middle class or the poor if you look at the two decades of research on what has been going on post nafta there s just very little evidence of big sustained effects on us labor i think it became a sort of political tool and a scapegoat really for a lot of anxieties that people were feeling and that scapegoat nature of the agreement was really sort of independent of what was going on with people s economic realities and if you look at polling data what s really interesting is the evolution of how people think about nafta and how the two parties thought about it even so if you go back about a decade and you ask people in 2010 or so what they thought of nafta the left and the right had pretty similar approval levels whether they identified as democrat or republican if you ask more recently interestingly the democratic approval for nafta is much higher than the republican approval i think this is partly because voters take their cues from what their leadership is telling them so trump has spent a lot of time talking about nafta as the worst possible agreement so i think the republican identity is sort of centered around that at least among voters if not elites and so it s clear that public opinion isn t always shaped by what s happening to people on a day to day basis but those polls may just be showing that for democrats whatever trump is for they re against and whatever he s against they re for and there seems to be sort of a deeper thing happening on the left where and this is probably always been there among unions to some extent but perhaps it s growing there seems to be this growing skepticism about capitalism as is practiced in the united states this skepticism seems to be in part a skepticism about trade and it sure seems like if we get a democratic president and democratic congress there is going to be a lot of skepticism about striking new trade deals that just doesn t seem to be where the party s going actually i would differ a little if you look for instance at the support for usmca in congress you saw a lot of democrats who were interested in getting that deal done who sort of realized that throwing away nafta was ultimately going to be a self destructive move u s president donald trump canada s prime minister justin trudeau and mexico s president enrique pena nieto attend the usmca signing ceremony before the g20 leaders summit in buenos aires argentina november 30 2018 via reuters kevin lamarque i m hoping that my book can contribute to this sort of battle of ideas and explain to receptive people throughout the political spectrum that it s probably in the best interest of the american middle class to not willy nilly start trade wars and destroy prior trading agreements if you look at the damage that s happened for instance over the past few years due to those kinds of actions you can see the point i m trying to make the point is that tariffs are actually not just a consumption tax but a regressive consumption tax that is paid disproportionately by the poor compared to other sources of government revenue and creating new trade disruptions actually can hurt workers in the manufacturing sector and in the economy that s because our export industries get targeted for retaliation and also american companies competitiveness often depends on global supply chains so it s pretty hard to take tariffs and trade wars and undo shocks that might have affected workers by putting up protection but it s pretty easy to create new shocks and new disruption to us workers so one thing i hope everyone can learn by looking at the past couple of years and also looking at the intellectual arguments here is that if we want to help us workers and we re sensitive to their economic needs we have to be a little subtler than just threatening to dismantle trade agreements and starting trade wars there are much more direct and productive ways to help them and i discuss several of these ideas at the end of the book would a trade skeptic on the left critique your book by saying so what you re offering is that after my job is gone to some other country then you re just going to give me retraining or a wage subsidy for a couple of years that seems like a possible critique you might here yes labor unions and representatives of labor are generally reluctant to say we don t want to be compensated for the jobs we ve lost we want to keep those jobs and that s a very legitimate feeling to have but i would point out that there are a lot of sources of economic disruption take computers and technology for instance you can easily lose your job to a robot or to automation or to the fact that it can now be done for free by artificial intelligence or something and those sources of disruption are very real too so i think what we need in our economy are powerful tools and i suggest for instance massively expanding the earned income tax credit that make sure that when gdp is growing it affects everyone in the income distribution then we don t have to worry so much about whether the job is being lost due to a robot or due to wal mart coming into town and driving out your store or being lost due to foreign competition regardless of what s buffeting the economy we can make sure that when gdp goes up it s going up for typical people too there are a lot of really powerful tools through the tax system and elsewhere i don t think retraining tends to be particularly effective but i have seen evidence that standing access to community college looking at possible innovation and things like a wage insurance program but also really direct things like expanding the eitc and the child tax credit and other things to get money down the income distribution and reward work at the same time i think those are really useful responses the problem with tackling trade directly i think a lot of people might be tempted to say well we should put up tariffs and try to bring those jobs back is that i m not sure that s effective we ve seen over the past few years as tariffs have been raised they have been raised substantially so we re seeing an experiment happening right now yeah we ve been running this experiment we ve been raising tariffs on products from china and elsewhere we ve also raised tariffs on european goods on canadian goods on goods with many of our trading partners and it s hardly led to a sort of reemergence of american manufacturing on the contrary we ve seen some businesses be hurt by those tariffs because they rely on inexpensive input goods that come from abroad when those input goods get more expensive it cuts into their ability to hire those workers and produce in the united states as just one example general motors paid a billion dollars in tariffs in the most recent year and this is at the same time they re closing plants in the midwest engines arrive on the assembly line at the general motors gm manufacturing plant in spring hill tennessee u s august 22 2019 picture taken august 22 2019 via reuters harrison mcclary so i think saying that restricting trade is going to be the answer to reclaiming the industries of yore is incorrect and potentially harmful to the very same workers that you re trying to help with those policies i think what you re saying is that broadly speaking in a well functioning economy there s going to be disruption and in fact it s required without there being some disruption you re probably going to have a very stagnant economy but we need to do a lot better of a job helping people deal with that disruption it also seems to me that in american politics you have more and more people saying we don t want disruption we don t want disruption from trade or from technology and it almost seems as if right after protectionism and trade barriers the next step up is going to be to try to protect workers from technology maybe we ll have robot taxes it seems to me that this is where the momentum is yeah and i guess i m pushing back against that momentum i mean you can complain about capitalism for the rest of time but we don t have evidence that any other system works right and capitalism comes with an incredible amount of creative disruption that doesn t mean we can t do things as a society to make a nicer capitalism you know helping for instance workers access health insurance which is something that the affordable care act did quite effectively pushing people from disruption and giving them access to tools that they need like free community college there are a lot of ways that we can chip in and make these destructive moments of capitalism less disruptive and i think it s really important to remember that when you look at things like the opioid crisis and the rise of suicide we risk ignoring a lot of human harm that s caused by job loss and job displacement but i think it s very foolish to say as a response to that well we need to stop capitalism or we need to stop trading with other countries or we need to throw away our computers into the harbor like imperial tea those kinds of actions actually are foolish short sighted responses that will ultimately make the middle class and the poor poorer rather than directly addressing their needs and i think a theme of the trade literature and of economics in general is that when you have a problem it s better to go straight to the problem rather than do something that s extremely indirect and hope that that helps the problem so in the case of climate change that s caused by carbon so make carbon more expensive rather than taxing imports from a country that you think might somehow contribute to the problem i guess i m not against carbon adjustment on the border but what i would say is that any problem you have if you go straight to the problem itself rather than taking these indirect swipes at foreigners that s a more productive and helpful approach is the case in favor of trade any different when dealing with a country like china we hoped they would become an open society but it seems to be going in the other direction and there s a massive national security dynamic to our relationship so does that change the case at all thinking about china as different from the other countries because they re potential geo political rival or a competitor or a threat one thing to keep in mind is the counterfactual we d love for china to be somewhat more open of a society and there are human rights concerns with respect to the uighur population for instance and with hong kong and elsewhere those are very real and important concerns so the next question is ok if we have these real and important concerns about a country what is the most effective way to encourage change and to work in a collaborative way with allies to exert pressure or soft power to improve the situation and if you look at the last few years i would argue that threatening china with trade wars implementing higher tariffs on many of their products facing the retaliation when they then put tariffs our products hasn t done one bit to address the very reasonable concerns that we might have about the chinese government s decisions chinese president xi jinping and former president hu jintao attend the parade marking the 70th founding anniversary of people s republic of china on its national day in beijing china october 1 2019 reuters jason lee sp1efa10mab1g so sometimes we re left with an imperfect reality where perhaps the more constructive thing to do would have been to work with a bunch of allies for instance we had a group set up to adopt the trans pacific partnership in part in order to have a set of allies that could respond in soft power ways to concerns about intellectual property for instance wouldn t it have been more effective to work with europe and with trans pacific allies to address these chinese intellectual property concerns than to alienate those two groups by withdrawing from the tpp and by threatening europe with various trade war actions does that make us more effective in negotiating with china i would say the contrary sometimes there aren t perfect policy answers to problems but there are better or worse things that you can do so i m in favor of building up alliances and friendly relations with countries and i also think economic interdependency can be a good thing that reduces the probability of war and conflict certainly there s a movement to do just the opposite some say that what we should be doing is decoupling our economy from a country that again seems to be becoming more authoritarian more of a totalitarian surveillance state and we should be doing nothing to help them boost their economy boost their technological prowess they argue that ideally we should try to isolate them from the global economy as much as possible until they decide to open their economy and government to make them more market friendly democratic anything else and we re just giving aid and comfort to an enemy according to some people well i think calling china an enemy is somewhat unfair to the historic relationship between our countries you know there are a lot of really productive relationships that we ve had with china in the past and i don t think we should attempt to prevent the economic rise of a country that s managed to lift over 800 million from below the world bank poverty line to well above that line through their substantial economic growth i don t think that economic growth is actually harmful to the future of the world i guess the question is how much power does the us have to shape the chinese governments decisions about what type of state it will be and what s the most productive way the us can engage with china to avoid serious international conflicts that are unnecessary while nudging china toward a better reality i don t think threatening them with trade wars is going to be effective at achieving those goals of making china a more open economy on the contrary i think you re going to see a more nationalistic sentiment in china more rallying around the flag and around that authoritarian government because the us is threatening the economic growth and prosperity of china and china can use this as a moment to scapegoat the united states saying that their government isn t at fault for the repressions that people might otherwise chafe against because the us is trying to prevent china s rise so we have to be careful about unintended consequences i know a lot of people on the right who think capitalism is a pretty good thing and they will point to how china has opened its economy to trade with the west and investment and how it s brought these hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and they ll say see that s a very clear example of why capitalism and trade are a good thing do people talk like that on the left saying hey capitalism can be great look how it brought all those people out of poverty is that an argument you hear much i certainly hear it in the circles that i travel in i go to economics conferences where i d say the vast majority of economists tend to support people on the center left on average do you hear it among your fellow professors who aren t economists the fellow professors who aren t economists i think can be persuaded pretty easily by looking at facts on the ground i think there s this really nice website called our world in data and i m often tweeting or retweeting insights that come from that website showing the massive amounts of economic progress that we ve seen throughout the world i do think that one of our goals for everybody on the right and left who thinks about these social problems carefully and is open and receptive to ideas i think one of our objectives with things like my book and this conversation is to change hearts and minds with data and reason i think there s room for the left and the right to work together on some of these issues we don t have to be in this sort of fight to the death of tribalism that you see often infecting our politics i think that there s a lot of mutual gain we have from thinking about how we should address these real problems that are faced by the poor and middle class in america while also keeping all of the great things about capitalism and openness that we ve come to love and i think that s going to be the big challenge for everyone in the middle the center left and the center right coming together to find an effective way to govern beyond all of this petty tribalism let s finish with immigration i think if you asked a lot of republicans what do you think the progressive case for immigration is i think their answer would be to have a lot of immigrants come into this country who will then vote for democrats that is the progressive case for immigration is that your case or is it something else oh on the contrary i think that you can look throughout us history in the beginning to now and it s quite obvious that immigrants have been a force for good over and over and over again in terms of innovation in terms of entrepreneurship in terms of economic growth in terms of raising the wages of native born americans by complementing their skills new citizens smile at a u s citizenship and immigration services uscis naturalization ceremony at the new york public library in manhattan new york u s july 3 2018 via reuters shannon stapleton so there s a very strong economic case for immigration that s based around the efficiency associated with taking somebody who is not being productive in their home country and moving them to the united states where they have all these great resources institutions and infrastructure to work with and we ve reaped those gains in a lot of ways if you look at us nobel prizes in scientific fields we tend to win the majority of nobel prizes in scientific fields but over the last four decades a majority of our nobel prizes have been awarded to foreign born researchers who are working in us universities and you can also look at trends in business start ups half of our billion dollar start ups have an immigrant on their founding team 40 percent of our fortune 500 companies were founded by either an immigrant or an immigrant s child so we ve got this long tradition of scrappy hard working immigrants coming to the united states and making a better life for themselves and for those around them i think the data are very clear on that what do the data say on the impact of low skill immigration on the wages of low skilled native born workers in the united states the vast majority of studies find very little effect of low skill immigrants on low skill workers there are a handful of studies that find the potential for some negative effects but those studies have often been critiqued and rethought elsewhere there s a nice experiment if you look at the mariel boatlift which is when for a brief period cubans were allowed to immigrate to the united states and increased the population of miami substantially and increased the low skill workforce of miami substantially and it s a nice policy experiment because no one anticipated it it essentially happened overnight and you can use that experiment to examine what happened to the wages in miami after looking at it and relooking at it there s very little evidence that that big influx of low skill labor harmed native born americans living in miami that s just one example but in general the literature is pretty positive here it doesn t mean that you can t find a person or two who s hurt by this but the efficiency gains in immigration are so large that you d be throwing out a lot of beneficial things if you restrict immigration in response to these concerns of the tiny subset of this literature and for the people who don t benefit what would be your main policy approach wage insurance the eitc i think if i could do two things one would be to expand the earned income tax credit to really get more money to those left behind especially those who are childless who don t receive much benefit from the eitc this would create more negative tax rates at the bottom of the income distribution which is really important another thing that i think we need to do better is to make investments that really complement our workers such as investing in research and development in infrastructure in community college in pre k education i think those are areas where the marginal social benefit of additional government spending is quite high and where additional spending should really help the prospects of american workers throughout the income distribution to wrap up based on what you ve seen so far with what s happening on the left and to democrats and what they ve been saying at these debates and on the stump have you become more or less optimistic that the democrats if they take control in washington will pursue a more open drawbridge down policy approach i think there s quite a bit of variety across the democratic candidates so it s a bit hard to generalize but i think that for instance if you imagine a world where joe biden becomes president and the democrats get the senate and house i do think that this policy scenario is one that could turn out to be quite favorable for equitable growth for making sure there s economic growth and openness while also making sure that growth is shared throughout the broader society i worry about some of the most left leaning candidates and their perspectives on these issues i think for instance the sanders campaign s thoughts on trade and immigration are not particularly sophisticated so in that sense i m somewhat less optimistic but i think part of the goal of the book and in general is to give people the information regardless of where they are on the spectrum with which to think about the arguments and the data surrounding trade and immigration in a more thoughtful way and a less reactive and ideological way and i think on both sides of the political spectrum there s work to be done

beyond the us presidential election in november 2020 according to him the tariffs were a big incentive for the chinese to negotiate in order to reach additional parts of this agreement according to us president trump the recently concluded trade deals with china canada mexico were only possible because of the implementation of tariffs so mnuchin acknowledged the statement of president trump and

inequality stagnation and instability the new normal for finance capitalism yilmaz akyüz is former director unctad and former chief economist south centre geneva geneva jan 24 2020 ips the failure of large scale bailout operations historically low interest rates and rapid injection of liquidity to bring about a strong recovery from the 2008 2009 financial crisis and recession created a widespread concern that advanced economies suffered from a chronic demand gap and faced the spectre of stagnation the subsequent growth experience has reinforced these concerns since the crisis the us has sustained the longest economic expansion in history but it is also one of the slowest in terms of income investment and job creation lagging other post war recoveries despite exceptionally favourable monetary policy recovery has been slower and more erratic in europe recently advanced economies have slowed further and global growth in 2019 was the lowest since the financial crisis intensifying the fear of another recession sluggish investment and growth rising inequality low inflation and interest rates and rapid debt accumulation have become common features of major advanced economies and indeed much of the global economy at large these are all interrelated at the centre of this state of affairs lies inequality wage suppression and concentration of wealth it is the main reason for the chronic demand gap exceptionally low inflation and interest rates and rapid build up of debt in sharp contrast with a long standing belief that income shares stay relatively stable in the course of economic growth there has been a secular downward trend in wage shares in all major advanced economies with real wages falling or lagging behind productivity growth in sharp contrast with a long standing belief that income shares stay relatively stable in the course of economic growth there has been a secular downward trend in wage shares in all major advanced economies with real wages falling or lagging behind productivity growth in most countries this started in the 1980s and continued unabated in the new millennium both before and after the 2008 2009 crisis in china too the wage share started to decline in the 1990s although this was reversed after 2010 as a result of efforts to establish a buoyant domestic consumer market the wage share in china remains significantly lower than that in major advanced economies wage suppression has been accompanied almost everywhere by growing concentration of wealth resulting also in greater inequality in the distribution of incomes from assets three factors have played an important role in growing inequality first liberal policies have led to the erosion of labour market institutions weakening labour while consolidating the power of large corporations second the increased size scope and influence of finance financialization has widened inequality and the demand gap as well as reducing growth potential by diverting resources to unproductive uses finally globalization has shifted the balance between labour and capital with the integration of china india and the countries that constituted the soviet union into the global economy the erosion of labour market institutions and financialization have gone further in the anglo american world and this explains why inequality is greater in the us and the uk than in other major economies the growing gap between labour productivity and wages means declines of the purchasing power of workers over the goods and services they produce this together with the increasing concentration of wealth and asset incomes results in underconsumption although sustained declines in wages would reduce the cost of production and increase the surplus in the hands of the capitalist class they would also limit the extent of the market since wages are the most important component of aggregate demand wage suppression thus creates the classical marxian problem of monetary realization of the surplus a reason why keynes also rejected declines in wages as a recipe for unemployment it adversely affects demand and profits expectations and hinders investment regardless of how low the cost of borrowing is exports can provide a way out until the 2008 2009 crisis china germany and japan all relied on foreign markets in different degrees to fill the demand gap using macroeconomic labour market and exchange rate policies gdp grew faster than domestic demand in all three economies thanks to a strong growth in exports after the crisis china s exports plummeted and the country first moved to a debt driven investment bubble and then sought to boost consumption to close the demand gap while moving to a significantly lower growth path germany replaced china as a major surplus country and japan also increased its reliance on exports to address the demand gap however this solution is not feasible for major underconsumption economies taken together it faces fallacy of composition and breeds trade conflicts the global south outside china is not big enough to provide an adequate market for the us europe japan and china they would need to run trade deficits in the order of several percentage points of their gdp for each percentage point trade surplus needed to avoid stagnation in the underconsumption economies they cannot rely on international capital flows to sustain such deficits the alternative is debt driven expansion sluggish wages reduce price pressures and allow and encourage central banks to create credit and asset bubbles to overcome stagnation without fear of inflation there is indeed a remarkable correlation between the declining wage share and declining interest rates in the us over the past three cycles the fed has been quite restrained in raising policy rates at times of expansion while cutting them drastically during contractions creating a downward bias in interest rates this policy stance creates destabilizing interfaces between debt and interest rates lower wages and subdued inflation lead to lower interest rates which together with financial deregulation encourage debt accumulation and asset bubbles this in turn makes it difficult for central banks to raise policy interest rates without causing disruptions in financial markets thereby making low interest rates self reinforcing indeed the downward bias in interest rates in g7 countries has been associated with a strong upward bias in debt since the mid 1980s suggesting that ultra easy monetary policies made possible by wage suppression and low inflation have led to a debt trap financial boom bust cycles generated by attempts to reignite growth by monetary easing and financial deregulation exacerbate the stagnation problem by creating waste and distortions on the supply side and reducing potential growth during booms the financial sector crowds out real economic activity and cheap credit entails massive capital misallocation diverting resources to low productivity sectors such as construction and real estate misallocations created by the booms are exposed during the ensuing crises when the economy would have to make a shift back to viable sectors and companies but this is often impeded by credit crunch and deflation second boom bust cycles also aggravate the demand gap by increasing inequality in the us for instance the crisis impoverished the poor particularly those subject to foreclosures while policy interventions benefitted the rich in the recovery the top one per cent captured almost 60 per cent of total growth from 2008 onwards real hourly wages stayed behind hourly labour productivity and the share of wages fell both during the contraction and the subsequent recovery two thirds of households in 25 advanced economies were in income segments whose market incomes did not advance or were lower in 2014 than they had been in 2005 these imply that when credit and asset bubbles burst and the economy contracts even a bigger bubble may be needed for recovery and growth in the us the bursting of the savings and loans bubble of the 1980s was followed by a bigger technology dot com bubble in the 1990s which ended at the turn of the century followed by an even bigger subprime bubble and bust leading to more aggressive interest rate cuts and liquidity expansion the past ten years have been relatively calm and stable several instances of heightened market volatility including during the taper tantrum of may 2013 and on the eve of the first rise in us policy rates in december 2015 did not lead to a lasting turbulence however this period of tranquillity has encouraged excessive risk taking and a rapid build up of debt thereby sowing the seeds of future instability very much as during the so called great moderation preceding the great recession permanently low interest rates and massive injection of liquidity have led to a search for yield in high risk high return assets globally starting with the us major stock markets have reached record highs and global debt has shot up to exceed 255 trillion or 320 per cent of world gdp in 2019 emerging economies in particular have seen a rapid build up of private debt in reserve currencies and increased penetration of their markets by international capital and firms heightening their external vulnerabilities and entailing large transfer of resources to advanced economies through financial channels as recognized by the world bank despite exceptionally low interest rates this wave of debt accumulation could follow the historical pattern and eventually end in financial crises in the next global economic downturn an important part of the debt accumulated in the past ten years could become unpayable leading to debt deflation and asset price declines the central banks would no doubt try to respond in the same way as they did during the 2008 2009 crisis but the scope for cuts in interest rates are now limited because they are at very low levels and there is already plenty of cheap money in the system these may severely compromise their ability to stabilize the economy a countercyclical keynesian fiscal reflation may save the day but much more would be needed to address the structural demand gap and its underlying causes a permanently bigger government financed by progressive income and wealth taxes and money printing greater state ownership of productive assets and control over economic activity income redistribution through the budget a level playing field between labour and capital a shift to wage led growth and taming financial capital

country uk the brexit bill as received royal ascent which means that in case it wasn t already clear the uk will leave the eu on 31 january and enter into the 11 month transitional period this is subject to eu lawmakers passing the brexit deal on wednesday but there s not expected to be any complications there although it would be very brexit if there was one last twist there may be no big ben bong for brexit if you ve not heard this story i envy you but the trade negotiation phase can now get underway not only is the uk keen to agree a new relationship with the eu in that time it also has admirable ambitions to strike one with the us as well that may be less complex but at the same time it doesn t make for an enjoyable 11 months for uk civil servants thankfully this coming week the topic of conversation will instead focus around the bank of england thursday s meeting has gone from a fond farewell to mark carney although brexiteers may remember him less fondly to an actual live meeting carney leaves the boe in mid march before the next meeting later that month it s become a coin toss for a rate cut which typically means it will be unchanged but odds have fluctuated quite dramatically over the last couple of weeks so that could change as we get closer to the vote us the fed is on hold and while no one expects any changes to the target range policymakers could tweak the ioer and provide some clarity on how they will end their purchases of treasury bills next quarter the january fomc meeting will likely see limited changes as the data since the december meeting has been slightly softer but countered by improved optimism following the us china phase one deal the dollar will stubbornly remain strong on safe haven flows but long term fed policy should provide a backdrop for weakness as the fed seems set for a path to see further balance sheet growth mexico the mexican peso will look to see if it remains one of the best performing currencies in latam the focus for peso traders will fall on preliminary fourth quarter gdp reading mexico is likely to see a boost from the usmca deal and while we could see a soft gdp reading raise calls for one more easing we may only see one or two more cuts by the banxico mexico has one of the best outlooks in latam and if the central bank maintains a high overnight rate carry traders may find the peso very attractive in 2020 hong kong coronavirus is front and centre of concerns as chinese new year starts tomorrow on the mailand hong kong is off from monday to wednesday a sars like induced economic slowdown could be a body blow to hong kong economy already in a protest induced recession one silver lining is that protests will likely be muted by coronavirus fears an escalation in the coronavirus emergency could see hong kong stocks collapse next week on their return to work china coronavirus concerns are increasing with more cases and deaths and the complete quarantining of wihun city and its 11 million people chinese stock markets fell 2 75 today china is now on holiday until the 30th of january a serious escalation of coronavirus emergency could see china stockmarkets collapse on friday 31st and the risk of a recession come very quickly the yuan could depreciate quickly upsetting the united states india india s supreme court to release judgement on the legality of modi s citizenship law protests are possible and if supreme court backs modi foreign direct investment could dry up deepening india s slowdown some parts of the financial sector are still on life support potentially very negative for the the rupee and indian equities market oil oil prices have been quite volatile this week not to mention one area that s been particularly sensitive to the breakout of coronavirus fears about the economic impact of a more severe outbreak appear to have hit oil prices at a time when demand dynamics are already a point of concern this is a very different response to what we saw in the

virus support may start to come in as it approaches 60 brent daily chart gold gold prices have been relatively stable over the last couple of weeks since events in the middle east settled down rallies are being sold into at the moment which signals weakness but the breakout of coronavirus could complicate things we re not seeing any significant safe haven moves right now but as the close in china

when not writing about economic issues she can be found watching period dramas writing stories or spending too much time on netflix less more education is a cornerstone of the american dream for many a college education is paramount to upward mobility in the united states professionals possessing a bachelor s degree typically earn 66 more than those with only a high school diploma and 75 of the fastest growing occupations necessitate a college degree however as the cost of attending college escalates this traditionally low risk path to prosperity is becoming impossible to reach for more and more americans since 1989 the cost of attending a private non profit university has more than doubled while the fees for an average four year public university have tripled in 2017 the institute for higher education policy reported that 95 of colleges in the united states were unaffordable for 8 out of 10 students in 2015 a whopping 83 of americans said they could not afford to go to college while the inaccessibility of college continues to escalate experts still cannot agree on the exact causes of this trend studies indicate many different possible drivers of increasing tuition costs for one state investment in higher education has declined which has been shown to raise tuition at an increasing rate others have different ideas in 1984 then secretary of education william bennett published our greedy colleges in the new york times now infamously known as the bennett hypothesis the article argued that expansions of student financial aid were the true culprits of increasing the cost of attending college if anything bennett wrote increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise their tuitions confident that federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase the bennett hypothesis has since then been a contentious topic among higher education policy analysts and academics a 2015 study from the new york federal reserve supported the hypothesis concluding that increases in pell grant and federal student loans strongly corresponded with increases in the cost of attending college the analysis found that for every dollar increase in the federal subsidized loan maximum the cost of attending college increased by 60 cents and for every dollar increase in the pell grant maximum college tuition increased by 37 cents however the federal reserve study was far from the end of the debate the correlation found in the study was most prevalent when it concerned expensive for profit universities with relatively low selectivity an american council on education report found that selective private institutions generally priced their tuition according to the willingness to pay of the wealthiest families in attendance a group that is largely unaffected by changes in federal aid policy the same study concluded that public colleges were more susceptible to changing their tuition based on financial aid but costs remained largely dependent on state politics and investment the center for american progress showed that college tuition increased even when student loan limits stayed constant from 1995 to 2014 the maximum loan limit only increased twice while tuition increased every year other research has found little to no relationship between increases in financial aid and increases in tuition for professional graduate school on the other hand a university of oregon study found that the bennett hypothesis could not be observed among public or lower ranked universities but found a strong relationship when it came to prestigious private universities it is little wonder that a literature review by the bipartisan congressional research service came to the conclusion that there were too many contradictory findings not only between different studies but also within single studies the report ultimately argued that it was not plausible to say college fees would not have increased in the absence of increases in financial aid clearly the relationship between financial aid and the rising cost of attending college is hotly contested however the debate has far reaching impact on policy making particularly during the past two years in 2018 secretary of education betsy devos claimed the united states was in the middle of a crisis and cited the bennett hypothesis stating it has something to do with what one of my predecessors famously pointed out decades ago when the federal government loans more taxpayer money schools raise their rates concurrently president trump s budget for the 2019 fiscal year eliminated some federal student loan programs including subsidized loans his 2020 budget proposal would slash higher education funding according to both devos and bennett s logic decreasing government spending on financial aid will drive down college tuition fees however it is important to consider the short term effects of cutting student aid and whom the cuts would most affect currently middle class students who do not meet the threshold to receive more generous grant aid packages and thus must take out more loans shoulder the biggest burden when it comes to student debt dartmouth sociology professor jason n houle found that students from families earning between 40 000 to 59 000 in annual income took on 60 more debt in comparison to lower income students and 280 more than students from families earning between 100 000 to 149 000 in annual income as students graduate the makeup of debt holders shifts in households aged 25 or older the highest income quartile actually holds the highest share of debt it is also worth noting that loan repayments are significantly more difficult for low wealth households even if their income is high considering the wealth disparity between ethnic groups this means that student debt disproportionately affects black and latinx debt holders in contrast pell grant recipients must come from families making 50 000 or less to qualify the majority of pell grant recipients come from families with annual incomes under 20 000 short term rollbacks on pell grant aid would affect the population of students who most lack access to higher education while the price of college has increasingly skyrocketed the maximum pell grant allowed has increased at a much lower rate cutting grant aid would eliminate a significant fraction of an already small sum at least relative to the full cost of college furthermore if the maximum pell grant disbursement falls students once eligible for the grant may find themselves taking out more loans to pay for college currently the pell grant only covers a fraction of the full cost of attending college since the 1970s the purchasing power of the pell grant has fallen from 67 to 27 of the average cost of attending college lowering the pell grant would mean that students who could not afford college before the pell grant would face increased pressures of student debt which may be exacerbated if they also come from a low wealth family even if rolling back financial aid programs results in downward pressure on college tuition in the long run reducing student aid has significant short term implications for college accessibility whether it is in the form of limiting flexibility and ability to repay loans or reducing grant aid the economics of reparations during every congress that has convened since 1989 h r 40 has been introduced to the house of representatives but it has never even been debated on the house floor originally sponsored by representative john conyers h r 40 is a bill about reparations for descendants of african american slaves h r 40 does not delineate any material policy to implement reparations rather the bill only moves to establish a federal commission investigating the history of slavery and possible remedies even so it has never been successful unlike in years past however public support for reparations has increased and a historic congressional hearing on june 19th of this year to discuss h r 40 received significant media and public attention now prominent congress members like bernie sanders elizabeth warren cory booker and kamala harris have all shown support for the bill as some of the above congressmembers running for president in the 2020 election such as harris and warren have also floated possible reparations programs in their platforms the likelihood of legislative action is greater than ever the legacy of slavery and racial wealth gap the need for some measures to address the black white wealth gap is clear past research on the topic indicates the current state of economic inequality across racial lines is shocking the federal reserve found that the median black household has ten times less wealth than the median white household currently black americans hold less than 2 of the nation s wealth despite being 12 13 of the u s population several factors have contributed to these disparities but most if not all are traced back to the devastating effects of slavery when emancipation after the civil war occurred in 1865 general sherman famously promised reparations in the form of 40 acres and a mule for every freed slave but such a program never came to fruition instead in the century and a half since then former slaves and their descendants have faced unjust compensation in sharecropping exclusion from owning property through discriminatory mortgage practices redlining and employment discrimination black wealth did accumulate in some areas of the nation like the greenwood neighborhood in tulsa oklahoma greenwood was predominantly african american and home to a number of wealthy black owned businesses like that of o w gurley a landowner who sold land exclusively to black buyers and j b stratford a hotelier greenwood became increasingly affluent as the number of black business owners attorneys and bankers grew and became known as the black wall street most of the money in greenwood was circulated around the neighborhood itself rather than being spent outside on white businesses greenwood s success soon drew the attention of the white residents living in the surrounding areas from may 31st to june 1st 1921 a mob of around 1 500 armed whites some given weapons by city officials rioted in the neighborhood they looted property burning more than 1 256 homes and leaving more than 8 000 formerly wealthy residents homeless the tulsa riot race massacre illustrated how barriers to financial success continued to exist for black americans even after accruing wealth for many black descendants of slaves it has been extraordinarily difficult to amass wealth like their white counterparts inequitable economic prospects continue to plague black americans even generations after the first emancipated slaves low wealth at the onset results in little generational transfer of wealth with the average black inheritance being 35 of the value of the average white inheritance as young black americans graduate college their wealth actually declines on average as they are more likely than white college graduates to support their parents financially these factors among many others perpetuate the cycle of wealth disparity that started at slavery the question now is whether reparations would feasibly and effectively remedy these institutional inequalities and on whom the onus falls upon to pay for the policy what would reparations look like currently there is no consensus on the details of a reparations plan most of the democratic presidential candidates barring marianne williamson do not advocate for direct payments of cash in fact professor william darity an economist at duke university who has been one of the foremost academics advocating for reparations found that a lump sum payment could actually increase the relative income of non black producers as black americans gain more purchasing power and consume non black goods leading to an absolute decline in black income as a whole darity has stressed the importance of programs fostering longevity in financial prosperity such as a public trust fund giving out grants for asset acquisition like homeownership or higher education another suggestion championed by democratic presidential candidate cory booker is a baby bond or savings issued to every infant at birth booker proposes a universal bond not restricted to black americans making his platform less of a purely reparations policy such a bond could be liquidated once the child reaches adulthood when it could be used for college costs or other expensive endeavors considering how racial income inequality is the primary driver of racial wealth inequality programs like subsidized higher education to encourage higher incomes for black americans may have a significant positive impact on the wealth gap however others have argued that government benefits locked for specific purposes are overly paternalistic an increase in the disposable income of black americans would allow for better quality of life as it opens access to higher quality everyday goods such as healthier food and better healthcare the freedom to spend a lump sum would also arguably afford more personal dignity to descendants of slaves who have already faced excessive institutional injustices with reparations programs however also comes the question of how to define their recipients professor darity has argued that reparations should only be restricted to the descendants of slaves a proposal heartily endorsed by grassroots organizations like american descendants of slavery however information about ancestry is still not universally ready to be tracked furthermore pan african activists have objected to the exclusion of other black americans activist nkechi taifa stated to the washington post it s extremely difficult to separate classes of black people the idea that unless you can actually trace your family directly to a slave that you haven t been subject to the legacy of slavery is a bunch of hogwash the population of black immigrants to the united states has risen comprising 8 7 of the black population many black immigrants come from the caribbean which also has a history of slavery quantifying reparations recipients will significantly impact how much the government must spend in total to fund such benefits which brings us to the most ready and vocal argument in opposition to reparations who will pay for such an expensive policy costs and payers experts have a wide range of estimates for the exact amount owed to descendants of slaves thomas craemer from the university of connecticut for example placed the total amount at 5 9 14 2 trillion in 2009 dollars while jason hickel argued that unpaid slave labor from 1619 1865 equaled up to 97 trillion total regardless with the u s federal budget being 4 1 trillion in 2018 1 3 trillion of which is discretionary spending there needs to be a viable way to pay for a robust reparations program lawyer willie e gary argued in favor of suing white southern families who historically benefitted from slavery while others have suggested a tax on all households in the top 1 of wealth unsurprisingly these proposals are likely to meet with backlash especially from americans who have not historically participated in slavery and feel they should not be penalized for a sin they did not commit other methods include government bonds to raise revenue which may phase out the costs of reparations with future returns to the payer despite the punitive aspects of these proposals however the american economy as a whole stands to gain from abolishing the racial wealth gap the racial wealth gap makes for substantial losses in the national gdp as black americans consume and invest far less than they would contribute to the economy if they had a larger share of the nation s wealth mckinsey reported that the racial wealth gap will cost the us economy between 1 trillion to 1 5 trillion between 2019 and 2028 in other words closing the racial wealth gap could increase the projected gdp in 2028 by 4 6 while the costs and gains of reparations mean that everyone in the united states is a stakeholder reparations remains a moral issue singularly centered on the experiences of african americans the united states cannot reconcile with such an ugly history of racial oppression and brutality without fully addressing it particularly when such a history still pervades multiple aspects of modern american society as author chuck collins argued to cnn people say slavery was so long ago or my family didn t own slaves but the key thing to understand is that the legacy of slavery created uncompensated wealth for white society as a whole immigrants with european heritage directly and indirectly benefited from this system of white supremacy the past is very much in the present with the attention on reparations increasing in both the political and public sphere the question of recompense for slavery and more broadly racial justice as a whole is here to stay until a satisfactory answer is found persecution for profit china s economic strategy in xinjiang the situation seems like something out of an orwellian dystopia the xinjiang region of china has been transformed into a modern police state as xi jinping s government significantly increased its security presence in the region the predominantly muslim uighur population has been subject to tactics of repression like an ongoing online surveillance system bans on religious practices such as veiling faces and keeping long beards and arrests on nonsensical charges without due process organizations like the human rights watch have estimated that up to a million uighurs are incarcerated in re education camps while such numbers have not been verified the slew of firsthand accounts from uighur survivors are both concerning and damning although tensions between xinjiang and beijing have always existed due to tensions between the uighur and han ethnic groups the chinese government has significantly strengthened its control over xinjiang in the past few years president xi jinping s administration has claimed that its actions are in response to the threat of terrorism in the xinjiang region the chinese government has used violent separatist groups like the east turkestan islamic movement to point to a larger problem with terrorism in the region especially in the wake of events like the 2009 mass riots that broke out in urumqi which killed 194 people and injured thousands more to address these concerns beijing has progressively strengthened its security presence over the last decade in 2010 domestic security spending in xinjiang increased by 90 the situation has only heightened in the past few years with reports of the mass internment camps coming to light in 2018 the communist party s desire to exact ideological control over the entire nation like some analysts have suggested does not fully explain why beijing has suddenly intensified its efforts in xinjiang according to uighur activist rushan abbas this has everything to do with the xi jinping s signature project the belt and road initiative because the uighur land is in the heart of the most key point of xi jinping s signature project china s belt and road initiative bri is an expansive plan that aims to create an open economic zone in eurasia and the middle east echoing the interconnectedness of the historical silk road xi hopes to build a massive collection of infrastructure projects including railways energy pipelines highways and border crossings to bolster trade between china and its neighbors because of the scope of bri the project stands to have far reaching effects not only on the chinese economy but also on the eurasian region as a whole as it will connect at least 65 countries collectively representing 30 of global nominal gdp xinjiang is a critical location along this new silk road key routes of the bri run straight through the region for example the china pakistan economic corridor runs through xinjiang to link china to the pakistani port of gwadar china daily a state run paper acknowledges that the region is a crucial gateway for the belt and road initiative its land border with seven countries means it is best placed to expand china s trade and ties not only with these neighboring nations but also with europe and beyond the same article notes that almost all trade from central asia passes through xinjiang and that beijing hopes to create a transportation and commercial hub there in the future beijing thus has a vested interest in eliminating unrest in xinjiang as of may 2019 china has already spent over 200 billion on belt and road projects and the projected gains from the bri are also significant a world bank study found that bri transportation infrastructure could increase global exports by 6 3 while partnering states along the economic corridor could see up to a 10 increase in exports considering the amount beijing has already spent to kickstart the bri the chinese government has strong incentives to secure returns on its investments bloomberg noted that concerns about lawlessness in xinjiang could chill investment both from foreign companies and risk averse chinese banks any violence in xinjiang that potentially interferes with the construction of bri projects is off putting to financial backers as an unnamed chinese financier communicated to a lowy institute report i prefer to invest in places like canada and australia where i can get safe and decent returns however where i have been ordered to invest in countries i will only allocate the minimum amount such fears extend to the unstable xinjiang china worries that terrorism in nearby states like syria and qatar could aggravate separatist groups in xinjiang hindering bri projects the government s actions against the uighur population could be a preemptive strike to protect its economic investments are the uighurs simply an obstacle for beijing s projects then rebecca warren of realcleardefense posits that the belt and road initiative projects in xinjiang actually aim to increase the livelihoods of the uighurs residing there with the goal of dissuading extremism and separatist violence in xi jinping s address to the 19th national congress of the communist party of china in 2017 he vowed to devote more energy to speeding up the development of old revolutionary base areas areas with large ethnic minority populations border areas and poor areas the belt and road initiative could be a means to actualize that priority peter cai from the lowy institute argues that the regional development aspect of is perhaps one of china s most important economic policy objectives if successful xi s administration believes it can quell the dissatisfaction that spurred the 2009 riots and avoid similar events as lu shuling the former chinese ambassador to islamabad stated the best medicine to address the terrorism problem is through tackling the incubator of terrorism namely poverty if beijing intends to improve the uighurs livelihood through the bri the initiative may generate the same concerns as past development projects in 1999 the chinese government launched an initiative called the great leap west to modernize and enrich xinjiang in order to better integrate the uighurs into chinese society the great leap west introduced a slew of infrastructure projects and investments into xinjiang with the central government spending around one hundred billion renminbi in just the first year on paper the policy was a success xinjiang s gdp has skyrocketed since 2000 and aggregate wages have increased by 470 if the bri were simply a continuation of past economic policies regarding xinjiang why the sudden crackdown in the past few years the twisted irony of repressing the uighurs for the purpose of helping them cannot be rationalized though a closer examination of great leap west policies may reveal an explanation xinjiang s past economic growth does not apply equally to the uighur and han populations as xinjiang modernized an influx of han workers migrated to the region in search of the increasing job opportunities while hans were only 7 of the xinjiang population in 1949 that number increased to over 40 by 2010 this migration of hans explains a significant portion of xinjiang s recorded economic growth the average income for a han was 1 141 rmb 161 24 usd as of 10 21 2019 per month in 2011 while the average uighur earned 892 rmb per month unsurprisingly ethnic profiling has been observed in hiring practices xinjiang s development also involves extraction of its natural resources when such resources are extracted however the uighurs receive almost no benefits from their region s own wealth xinjiang s reserves of natural gas coal and other fossil resources represent over 20 of china s total energy reserves making it the largest fossil fuel source in the country china s coal consumption has risen significantly in the past two decades and it has been a net importer of coal since 2009 to satisfy this high demand access to xinjiang s energy resources are vital to china s rapid industrialization but means that only 2 of xinjiang s oil remains in the region the rest services the wealthy han dominated urban centers on the east coast via the xinjiang shanghai pipeline the logic of a short term crackdown on uighur rights with the long term goal of economic development to prevent terrorism is paradoxical as weiwen yin of texas a m university found the increase in economic performance from the great leap west had a positive correlation with the probability of terrorist attacks precisely because unequal economic gains across ethnic lines spawned grievances among the uighur population beijing s current tactics of repression are likely to generate even more discontent among the uighurs the approach is counterproductive if the chinese government s goal is truly to foster regional development as an anti extremism measure the more pernicious possibility is that the bri and all the limits on uighur freedoms accompanying it was always designed to serve the han majority either possibility comes at a significant human cost that the international community cannot ignore

frankfurt am main european central bank president christine lagarde was slightly more upbeat on thursday about risks to the eurozone economy and insisted climate change would be central to a rethink of the institution s goals and methods risks to the euro area remain tilted to the downside but have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding lagarde told reporters in frankfurt while an orderly brexit and a us china trade truce have cleared some of the air around trade president donald trump raised fears of a fresh row this week when he revived a threat to slap tariffs on european car imports but with european commission president ursula von der leyen set for us eu trade talks in washington next month the tone and the determination on both sides to draw positive conclusions i think is to be taken as a positive signal lagarde said as expected governors left interest rates at historic lows and maintained quantitative easing qe bond buying purchases at thursday s meeting the second chaired by lagarde since taking the helm in november they also officially kicked off a major strategic review expected to last all year we will not leave any stone unturned lagarde reiterated with the primary focus of the rethink how the bank defines its mandate of maintaining price stability and how best to pursue it the institution s last stock taking in 2003 took place several years before the global financial and economic crisis forced it into unprecedented stimulus action pressed repeatedly by reporters on how she sees different aspects of policy developing lagarde said it would be unfair to preempt the outcome the toughest challenge will be how the ecb communicates about the review and the question of how to give a constructive outlet to differing opinions once it s over economist marcel fratzscher of german think tank diw said much of lagarde s first weeks and months in office were spent smoothing over differences after an acrimonious battle over policy loosening broke out under predecessor mario draghi in a statement about the ecb s planned review the debate around the bank s inflation target took pride of place for most of its active life the ecb has aimed for inflation close to but below two percent to fulfil its mandate to keep eurozone prices stable over the past seven years it has failed to achieve that level despite unprecedented policy experiments including years of negative interest rates and over 2 6 trillion euros of qe one option would be to simply target inflation around two percent the ecb s monetary policy toolkit and communications were equally prominent in the statement but lagarde s much hyped push to bring climate considerations into policymaking received only a supporting role alongside financial stability and employment concerns i m aware of objections that climate action could distract from the ecb s primary objective lagarde said but she warned of the danger of doing nothing failing to try is already failing she insisted adding that commitment to climate action is now the determination of the european commission of many of the euro area leaders and which is also now creeping into the private sector with some signs pointing to decreasing risks and a rebound from 2019 s growth slowdown this year policymakers will be hoping the ecb will be left in peace to determine its new direction without too many distractions a substantial change of the ecb s monetary policy before the end of the strategy review looks unlikely said ing bank analyst carsten brzeski binge worthy and nail biting ecb meetings will otherwise not return before the end of the review he added the international monetary fund lagarde s old patch this week pointed to a moderate pick up in global growth ahead although policy missteps could still derail it nevertheless some economists predict the ecb will lower rates further this year if no pickup in growth and inflation is forthcoming meanwhile qe is expected to continue at 20 billion euros 22 billion worth per month well into 2020
the human brain excels at taking shortcuts processing all the information our senses collect takes a lot of energy so repetitive data gets lower priority things we see often fade into the background so we can notice new stuff this is where we get phenomena like nose blindness we stop perceiving familiar smells like our pets perfume cigarettes and even our own body odors but others do smell them which can get awkward i think something like that may explain why the federal reserve doesn t see the inflation others notice their data says inflation isn t a problem so they ignore indications otherwise we see this in their policy decisions and it s not just the fed other central banks wall street analysts economists and politicians have the same affliction the kindest thing we could do is tell these people about their ahem unattractive condition they might not react well but at least we will have tried so that is what i will do today i ll show how the fed s lack of concern notwithstanding inflation is a serious problem for many americans in addition to federal reserve officials most economists look at yet another set of inflation data and argue that inflation is too low from their perspective they are right but that doesn t mean that you and i aren t experiencing inflation in what we buy furthermore the way we measure inflation has been changed many times over the years it may be time to do yet another adjustment to our inflation measures to better reflect the economic reality of the average american today i m talking about price inflation i e changing prices of the goods and services we all must buy price is as we learned in econ 101 the intersection of supply and demand prices change when one of both those curves move which they do for many reasons monetary policy is a big one but not the only one consumers and producers both have many constraints such as wages and wage growth disposable income on the one hand and cost of goods and actual demand for their products on the other hand somewhere in the middle they find balance and that is where prices settle that s the economic theory in practice it is a lot messier since we have such a dazzling array of goods services people and places not every market is equally efficient therein lies the problem how to distill this complexity into one meaningful number wonks tell us with all sincerity things like the us cost of living rose 2 1 last year really to an actual numerical decimal place on something as vague and as complex as inflation now to give them credit they are looking at the total national inflation rate and it is extraordinarily complex they do the best they can but the inflation you and i experience they don t know that they can t know it at least not with any precision because the cost of living is so individualized everyone spends their money differently and the things they spend it on vary in price for many reasons that doesn t stop the wonks from trying of course and it s not entirely their fault they work for policymakers who demand information whether it s accurate information is less important than simply having something on which to hang their hats one of the most important economists of the last century was kenneth arrow during world war ii he was tasked with predicting the weather on d day when the allies would attempt a beach landing in france the weather would be critical arrow told his commanding general there was an extraordinary amount of uncertainty for his prediction the general answered we know that but we need a number to work with and you have to give us the number talk about a no pressure environment government statisticians while maybe not feeling the same pressure are also responsible for millions of lives since so much personal income is tied to that inflation number note also policymakers have preferences on what the number should be many government programs have inflation adjustments higher inflation forces politicians to make tough decisions about taxes spending and borrowing these same politicians hire and pay the people who compile the inflation numbers that s what we would call in the investment world a disclosable conflict of interest having said all that i believe the analysts try to be fair and scientific they have to work within boundaries that don t always make sense so we get crazy things like hedonic adjustment that s where they modify the price change because the product you buy today is of higher quality than the one they measured in the past like what you re reading get this free newsletter in

back in the 1980s cost about 4 000 the one i have now on which i do similar work writing was about 1 600 so my computer costs dropped 40 but no today s computer isn t remotely comparable to my first one it is easily a thousand times more powerful so the price for that much computing power has dropped much more than 60 it s probably 99 9 louis gave surfaced another example according to consumer price index data a television set that cost 1 000 in 1996 is now 22 you can t buy any such product today but the fact you can spend the same amount of money and get a better tv depresses the inflation rate source gavekal they do the same thing for cars as peter boockvar noted earlier this month last week edmonds com said the average price of a new vehicle sold in 2019 was 37 183 a new record high and up 30 from where it was 10 years ago within today s cpi the price of a new car reflected a 2 increase in total since 2009 this is magically done via hedonic adjustments which discount the value of new add ons with each subsequent iteration of cars unfortunately the actual buyer of a car has to pay what the price is and that is why delinquency rates are rising according to the ny fed loans 90 days late totaled 4 7 in q3 the highest since 2011 and the average length of a loan is at a record high experian said in november that 7 year auto loans amount to 31 5 of new vehicle sales vs 10 in 2010 the average price of a car is about 60 of median income in the us and incentives in december were a record amount of 4 600 per vehicle on average according to jd power the fed relies on hedonically adjusted data points and not the price that people are actually paying out of pocket exactly hedonically adjusted prices exist only in theory they don t reflect what people actually have a choice of spending health insurance is another good example cpi says it rose 20 4 in 2019 that s a national average that could be much more depending on your age and location but worse is the policy you can buy now identical to the one available a year ago certainly not it could have a higher deductible narrower network smaller drug formulary and a wide variety of internal differences in coverage for various conditions which you will never know unless you seek treatment the real price change is impossible to know that 20 4 is a national average of local guesswork bearing no connection to anyone s reality it gets even more complicated i quoted cpi above the federal reserve actually prefers something called pce personal consumption expenditures the two indexes have different estimates of the appropriate basket the cpi is based on a survey of what households are buying the pce is based on surveys of what businesses are selling social security uses the cpi for adjustments the fed uses pce when targeting inflation pce is generally lower as we can see from the chart below source advisor perspectives i mention cars and health insurance because they are two of the larger budget items for most households and both are broader in reality the car takes you nowhere unless you also buy fuel insurance and maintenance health insurance helps only after you pay your deductible and co pays which can be substantial but housing is the biggest single living cost for most people here again the individual variation is so huge as to render national averages meaningless even if they were accurate and they re not for instance if you bought your home years ago with a fixed rate mortgage your personal housing inflation rate has been zero your monthly payment is the same as it was then if you have a variable rate mortgage you might even be paying less for the same house depending on when you bought it because your rate dropped but housing costs aren t just mortgage payments because a house can be more than housing if you re lucky it is also an investment that will give you a profit someday meanwhile you get to use it as your home and avoid paying rent cpi recognizes this its housing component is a combination of average rental rates and something called owner s equivalent rent oer that s the amount you would expect someone else to pay if you rented your home to them you are in effect paying it to yourself according to the december 2019 cpi report rent of primary residence rose 3 7 last year and owner s equivalent rent rose 3 3 those two combined are about 33 of cpi do they reflect reality in any significant way maybe it depends on the kind of housing you need and where you need it according to apartment list the national average increase in apartment rent was 1 4 last year but it was considerably more in some places mesa arizona phoenix area tops their ranking at 5 1 source apartment list those are apartments house rental rates are something else completely as are home and condominium purchase prices as noted above your home s resale price has no impact on inflation unless you actually sell it and even then it doesn t show up in the inflation measure but home values can give us a rough approximation corelogic data shows something interesting source corelogic price changes in the last year were highest at the low priced end up 5 6 compared to 3 4 in the highest tier but according to bls national average owner s equivalent rent for homes of all prices rose only 3 3 so that doesn t fit and again the national variation is dramatic corelogic s home price index rose 10 2 in idaho and actually fell slightly in connecticut like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha now you might say the difference between 3 3 and 5 6 isn t so dramatic remember we are talking about a full third of the budget for most families so if cpi has been understating housing costs by as much as it hedonically understates vehicle prices it s enough to make a difference a dramatic difference if compounded over time and especially if you are on social security or other inflation adjusted income the agencies don t simply adjust their inflation measures on a whim they have reasons most of which make sense but they add up to a number that doesn t reflect actual experience this causes policy errors and greater problems we have other non government inflation figures one is the venerable shadowstats which adjusts the published cpi numbers using the methodologies the government itself used in 1990 that adjustment has its own limitations but might be closer to the reality you experience source shadowstats recently the cpi under the old methodology has been running about four percentage points annually above the official numbers another alternative measure is the chapwood index twice a year chapwood checks the price for 500 common consumer items see list in the 50 largest cities as of mid 2019 the five year average annual cost of living change in those cities ranged from 6 6 to 13 1 in oakland ca if you re wondering that s more dramatic and possibly overstated even if you chop chapwood s numbers in half and remember they measure retail prices if you measured wholesale items that businesses purchase you might even see deflation now the people who sit on the federal open market committee aren t foolish they are aware of data limitations so why do they persist in thinking inflation is under control or shudder look for ways to generate more of it to answer i ll summarize a very complex argument among economists forgive me if i oversimplify it essentially if you used shadowstats or any other statistic showing higher inflation you have to assert that gdp has been shrinking for 30 years that is clearly not the case the us economy has grown albeit slower in the last 10 years but we are certainly not in a constant negative 2 per year recession looking at actual nominal gdp yet another imprecise measure we are clearly growing again this can be very misleading to any individual your personal gdp may be either growing or shrinking a lot depends on how your business is doing if you are a business owner your salary or wages etc national gdp is the theoretical and let me emphasize the word theoretical total production of 330 million people source fred so when economists say inflation measures are too high they are making a macroeconomic argument from top down data others who argue inflation is significantly understated rely on bottoms up data both sides are arguing a particular point of view using data to buttress their viewpoint a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest i understand both arguments and they both make extraordinarily valid points but for those of us living in the real world are hard to swallow nominal average weekly earnings for all employees rose 28 in the last 10 years if we can believe that data the average worker has roughly kept up with average inflation if average inflation accurately reflects the cost of living for many people it clearly hasn t so the average worker has probably fallen behind how much it depends on what you buy seriously source gavekal we started out talking about nose blindness most people don t keep careful track of their spending and income they don t know their wages rose x and spending rose y in the last decade they just know making ends meet is tough and getting tougher so if both the public and the fed are nose blind to inflation where does it take us nowhere good but we re going there fast like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha i believe the pressure on the average american can t be expressed in wages or inflation for most people disposable income is where they live and breathe fixed costs whatever yours are eat into disposable income that s what we feel the yellow vest protests in france arose from a rather small increase in the subsidized diesel fuel price similar fuel price protests recently swept iran chile has had major riots in protest over public transportation costs rising a few pennies similar situations have occurred elsewhere relatively small price increases for an item or two can be the straw that breaks the camel s back when disposable income is so tight that even a few pennies mean the difference between food for your children or not anger can explode into riots the actual prices at stake may not be significant except they act as the straw i have serious concerns about how we measure gdp we double count some items not the least of which is government expenditures making the economy seem bigger than it actually is what we call inflation is an imprecise measure of an artificially created government statistic when we measure real gdp we are using that imprecise measure on yet another imprecise measure of artificial government statistics called nominal gdp the irony is that we think we can measure gdp or inflation out to two decimal points i have always contended anything to the right of the decimal point is simply economists trying to demonstrate they have a sense of humor like a weather forecast for d day we need a number but we should recognize the limitations furthermore remember that these measures are for 330 million people in an extraordinarily chaotic and complex society we count some items and ignore others or we apply adjustments which aren t real world as they say your mileage may vary this is yet another reason the fed shouldn t be allowed to control short term rates except in the most extreme circumstances and then only to provide liquidity the use of artificial measures to set the price of the most important commodity in the world the interest rate of the us dollar of necessity leads to imbalance and occasional crises a low interest rate environment misallocates capital into financial transactions which are not necessarily productive while it may make money for some people it doesn t add to the general well being and that is not going to change those of us responsible for allocation of capital for clients and ourselves have to recognize reality and invest accordingly all the while knowing that imbalances are increasing and we will eventually face a reckoning sigh i find myself in philadelphia for a

there will be no shortfall of market moving events in the coming week with plenty of top tier data and crucial central bank meetings shaping the agenda the federal reserve will hold its first policy meeting of 2020 but q4 gdp and pce inflation numbers out of the united states are likely to be more helpful for investors in gauging the next move in interest rates in comparison the bank of england s meeting is expected to be the most exciting in quite some time elsewhere inflation figures from australia and flash gdp estimates from the eurozone will set the tone for the aussie and the euro respectively meanwhile the world will be keeping an eye on the deadly coronavirus as any signs that the outbreak is worsening could further dampen risk sentiment australian cpi data could ease rate cut dilemma for rba expectations of a february rate cut in australia continue to see saw as de escalating trade frictions devastating bushfires and better than forecast data have seen investors flip flopping between a reduction and no change the latest consensus is that the reserve bank of australia will hold off from cutting rates at its february 4 meeting after december employment numbers pointed to limited impact so far to the economy from the bushfires that have been ravaging the country since october if next week s report on the consumer price index cpi for the fourth quarter is equally impressive the odds for policy easing in february are likely to diminish further the cpi figures are due on wednesday and will be followed by the producer price index ppi for the same period as well as private sector credit numbers for december on friday ahead of those the nab business conditions survey for december might attract some attention on tuesday which may do a better job of revealing the scale of the damage from the bushfires on businesses the australian dollar is in danger of being pulled lower again if the price indicators disappoint the aussie will also be swayed by china s official manufacturing pmi due on friday which will provide investors with the first glimpse on how the chinese economy performed in the first month of the year the chinese market will be closed for the rest of the week as the country celebrates the lunar new year but the nation will not be able to escape the headlines as authorities battle to contain the spread of the new virus japanese data to be watched for signs of rebound industrial output retail sales and unemployment figures due in japan on friday will be important amid fears the economy is struggling to find its footing following the october sales tax hike and the endless slump in exports if the preliminary industrial output and retail sales readings for december fail to turn positive after the previous month s negative prints it would cast doubt on the bank of japan s recent upward revisions to its growth forecasts the boj meanwhile will shed more light on its last policy decision when it publishes a summary of the january meeting on wednesday however as far as the yen is concerned the main driver for the safe haven currency will be how well risk appetite holds amid a possible pandemic from the coronavirus bank of england ponders rate cut the bank of england will announce its latest policy decision on thursday now commonly dubbed as super thursday as it is the meeting where the bank will also publish its quarterly monetary policy report and hold a press conference while politicians at westminster finally enjoy some calm as boris johnson s withdrawal agreement completes its passage through parliament and becomes law the economy is stagnating as it reels from the brexit turmoil that gripped the country in 2019 the uk is now on course to formally leave the european union on january 31 though in practice aside from no longer holding a seat at the eu s decision making table nothing will change until the end of the year when the transition period ends the transition period will kick in at 23 00 gmt on january 31 and the streets are sure to be filled by passionate leavers celebrating britain s historic exit from the world s largest trading bloc however it will be a much more sombre mood at the boe where policymakers will be debating whether to cut interest rates or not expectations of an interest rate cut shot up earlier this month when governor mark carney and two other monetary policy committee mpc members flagged lower rates their dovish views were reinforced by weak economic indicators for november december but more recent data has been somewhat more encouraging and markets are now split about 50 50 as to whether the boe will ease next week the pound is vulnerable to a big tumble in its initial reaction if there is a cut given that it hasn t been fully priced in but investors will also be looking at the bank s predicted rate path for the coming period for the prospect of future easing and any sell off could be short lived if policymakers are not overly gloomy about the outlook eurozone economy chugging along very slowly preliminary fourth quarter gdp numbers for the euro area will come under the limelight on friday but ahead of that january business surveys will be the order of the day germany s ifo business climate index is out on monday and the european commission s economic sentiment indicator is released on thursday both are expected to show increases for january consistent with the trend seen by other surveys such as the ihs markit pmis moving to friday s data which also includes flash inflation readings the focus will be on how the eurozone economy fared in the final three months of 2019 gdp is projected to have expanded by 0 2 quarter on quarter in q4 slowing slightly from the prior 0 3 rate if confirmed it would underscore the view that growth in the region is stabilizing and that a rebound may be just around the corner the flash cpi report is also expected to support an improving economic picture the headline rate of inflation is forecast to inch up from 1 3 to 1 4 year on ear in january though the core rate is anticipated to tick down slightly to 1 3 y y the euro which has been drifting lower since the start of the year is likely to accelerate its declines if the gdp print disappoints a more upbeat fed over in the us it will be a packed week for data but investors will also get to hear from the fed which will conclude its two day monetary policy meeting on wednesday starting with the economic releases for december new home sales will kick off the week on monday durable goods orders will follow on tuesday pending home sales are out on wednesday and the personal income and outlays report will be closely watched on friday another solid increase in personal income and consumption is forecast for december though the other key component of this report the core pce price index is not anticipated to impress as the fed s favourite price gauge is expected to have held steady at 1 6 y y in terms of surveys the conference board s consumer confidence index and the chicago pmi will be monitored on tuesday and friday respectively but the main highlights of the week will be the fed meeting and the advance gdp estimate the us economy is forecast to have grown by an annualized rate of 2 1 in the three months to december the same pace as in the prior quarter with earlier forecasts predicting a sharp slowdown in q4 such a figure would be welcomed by the markets as well as fed policymakers the recent brightening of the global growth outlook on the back of the trade war ceasefire will likely lead to the fed sounding more confident about the american economy in its statement as it keeps policy unchanged the combination of an upbeat fed and positive data would help the us dollar extend its latest gains as it scales 7 week highs against a basket of currencies but safe haven flows could also benefit the dollar if fears of a new pandemic were to intensify north of the border it will be a relatively quiet week apart from canada s monthly gdp reading for november
we can no more look at mauritius in isolation when making an analysis of its economic performance and deciding of its future and vision of where we would like mauritius to be mauritius is part and parcel of the global economy and influenced by what happens elsewhere more so today given the fact that we are an exporting country be it goods and services including tourism sector and we almost import pretty much everything we consume without forgetting our financial services sector which is reliant on foreign investors money passing via mauritius so what s the status of the global economy the global economy went through an unsurprising slow down in 2019 after almost a decade of bull run global growth since the financial crisis of 2007 08 this ongoing growth has been on the back of major quantitative easing with low interest rates in major economies pump money and you hope that this will boost and kick start the global economy that was the aim post financial crisis 2020 does not seem to be improving with major downside risks still hanging around 2020 does not seem to be improving with major downside risks world bank as usual seem to have an optimistic forecast of 2 5 for the global economy compared to 2 4 in 2019 bearing in mind that the same world bank revised its growth forecast several times downwards in 2019 since we have started the new year 2020 a number of events are already prompting the downside risks for global growth and these include the following we have seen increasing tensions between usa and iran in the 1st week of the year the usa china trade war is not over yet political turmoil in the usa with trump s impeachment trial political change in spain whereby a last minute coalition had to be concluded with the extreme left russia s unexpected change of government the longest strike in france where workers are fighting for their retirement rights australia under fire for the longest number of months highlighting the environmental challenges facing the world continuous civil unrests in lebanon and hong kong south africa going through the toughest time ever with the failure of both eskom the national electricity provider and south african airways its national airline and facing a rating downgrade to junk status by moody the german economy growth in 2019 at 0 6 was at the slowest pace since the euro zone s debt crisis and both emerging markets china and india growth forecast to remain low this decade in addition as if these were not enough bad news the new managing director kristalina georgieva of the international monetary fund imf made a shocking statement last week saying that the risk of a great depression similar to 1920s could be real for this new decade what a start for 2020 where can we find the upside to prompting global growth rate upwards it seems extremely unlikely in this global environment one thing for sure is that stability is something of the past and we are living in a world of increasing uncertainty against this tough backdrop the mauritian economy despite being very small in comparison to the global economy will continue to face these global head winds in addition various pillars of the economy have reached a cross road or even the end of a life cycle and we need structural changes at this point in time and innovative ideas to manoeuvre through this new decade for an economy like mauritius to bank on consumption led strategies by pumping liquidity in the system is a short term fix and short sighted we can t carry on like that and it s high time that the public and private sector regroup and transparently work together to mitigate all the downside risks ahead of us mauritius gdp growth in 2019 and forecast in 2020 it was expected that the original gdp growth forecast for mauritius of 3 9 for 2019 set by the bank of mauritius bom was never going to be met since june 2019 and yet the bom persisted with the 3 9 until we reached the end of november 2019 whereby the forecast was eventually levelled down to a realistic 3 6 even the central statistics office cso recast to 3 6 well before the bom the question we should ask is why an institution like the bom which is at the heart of the mauritian economy has visibility on all the sectors of the economy and monitors the ins and outs of money in the country couldn t see that the original forecast of 3 9 wasn t going to be met well in advance how did they miss what was obvious to many the next question is whether their forecast going forward can be trusted let s see what they come up with in the near future the new minister of finance and the challenges ahead as for the 2020 forecast again it will be very unlikely that the 4 will be met as the global economy is still struggling and the structural difficulties for the various pillars of the local economy remain i think we might end up in the range of 3 5 3 6 again with public investment pushing that growth rather than private sector investment if nothing radical is done we now have a full time minister of finance which hasn t been the case for the last three years it has been a bit more than two months since the new minister has taken the hot seat and he has been very silent we can put it on the fact that december was the month of festivities and hence not much for him to talk about however reality for his silence or rather embargo might be that of the long awaited discours programme 2020 2024 which is due to happen on the 24th of january 2020 till then motus et bouche cousue a lot of promises have been made prior to the last general elections and now it is time to deliver be it as it may the new minister of finance has a tough task in front of him a lot of promises have been made prior to the last general elections and now is the time to deliver his main challenges will be to stimulate private sector investments as the public sector cannot keep on to carry the bucket of stimulating the economy via public investment ad vitam attract at least us 1billion of fdi annually compared to 500m which we have been receiving annually over the last five years if he means business and more so given our ease of business rating has improved to number 13 keep our national debt at sustainable levels and manage the twin deficits being budget and trade deficits here i would like to point out that a discours programme in itself is not a saviour we have had discours programmes before but then a number of ideas remain stuck in theory and hard to implement more so because of some disconnect between vision and the reality on the ground both locally and globally the concept that the government alone will come up with an economic miracle road map and the private sector will just tag along is an old concept that s unlikely to work in this new global environment what we need today are practical ideas and solutions mauritius economically is an easy fix and for that we need to assemble both public and private sector and agree on a road map for the next five years minister of finance and the social agendas social agendas in a globally difficult environment and in the context where we are in terms of our economy pillars at the end of life cycles coupled with a balance sheet like mauritius will be difficult to sustain unless we break away from what has been a slow era of growth for the mauritian economy in the last decade the last decade was what i would qualify as a lost decade and we cannot have another lost decade this time we can t afford it anymore we need at least 5 gdp growth but not any type of growth but rather efficient and inclusive gdp growth to be able to sustain the social agendas we can t promise forever what we don t have and don t seem to have visibility of in the future as far as i know we are not qatar nor uae where we have cash reserves sitting under our soil what we need today are practical ideas and solutions there are 2 scenarios scenario 1 if we carry on in having the same economic policies and slow economic growth and nothing radical to stimulate the economy the social agendas will be difficult to sustain and deficits will run bigger and at some point in time we can end up in an effet de boule de neige and we then fall in the populism trap leading to a greece scenario that s the worst case scenario scenario 2 if he is able to instil confidence to the business community open mauritius further to attract both private sector investment and the much needed foreign direct investments fdi then this will lead to a multiplier effect whereby the economy will create jobs create value boost consumption and the bigger the economic pie can grow the better we can share and more importantly sharing in an efficient way that would reduce currently growing wealth inequality private sector on the sitting fence and for how long we have to be realistic here the private sector needs visibility stability consistency in terms of economic policies and also engaging ministers in a positive way if these conditions are reunited a number of private sector companies are willing to invest and re invest we have to also acknowledge that our private sector is small and is too stretched in too many old pillars of the economy which led them to a very tight cash situation this is not an excuse this is just the reality we are facing we should not stigmatise the private sector for that cash tight situation but rather embrace what they need and can reinvest for example practically speaking a number of them need their permits to be delivered and for government bureaucratic process to be simplified further having said that banking only on our local private sector will not solve our economic problems that s why we need foreign direct investment fdi of at least 1billion annually we need new investors to come in and in an unstable world we have the ability to attract investors and here we need a sniper approach to know where we need to go and who we need to attract to invest in mauritius south africa is a prime example where with the current troubling situation in south africa mauritius should have accentuated its marketing program to attract south african investors in the sectors of agriculture financial services real estate and technology in addition to foreign investors mauritian diaspora who have healthy cash and expertise and ideas should be encouraged to come back and invest in their home country take for example ghana whereby successfully launched the year of the return of the diaspora in 2019 and got many who have committed to come back and invest and stimulate the economy as they say if you want a new recipe you can t make it with the same ingredients you also need new ingredients we should be extremely concerned that we have a growing youth unemployment we should be extremely concerned that we have growing youth unemployment aged below 25 years old which is increasing every single year and has reached almost 25 this is not good at all and not sustainable we cannot have increasing youngsters who come to the labour market and hopes for the future destroyed this is not healthy at all for a small country like mauritius the issue is the mauritian economy had a slow gdp growth era in the last decade and it is correlated with the fact that not sufficient number of jobs have been created on top of that there is a mismatch with the jobs and the skillsets available for example the global business offshore sector is currently in a period of transition as over the last two decades this sector required back office administration accounting skill sets to incorporate and administrate gbl1 and gbl2 companies the good old and easy days of the global business sector are over but it doesn t mean the financial services sector has no future on the contrary the future is bright if we do this much needed transition today in the global sector we need to go up the value chain immediately and one of the skillsets required now is investment banking and the market locally has very limited and most likely no professional experienced investment bankers the same thing when we talk about wealth and asset managers there s a lack of professionals we saw this coming over the last five years and yet there s no one advising our youngsters that company secretarial and back office accounting are becoming less relevant and that rather we need these new skillsets of investment banking and asset wealth management so we are therefore stuck with lowly and even poorly skilled youngsters who come out of university and don t fit the job profiles available this is where we have a great opportunity to tap upon our diaspora who are working in london singapore dc dubai sydney etc we have seen lately a couple not enough though of mauritian diaspora who used to work overseas in very high flying jobs and who have returned back to mauritius and taken high level positions in key private sector companies we need to see far more of that mauritius and africa one of the things we could easily position mauritius within less than two years is to position the island as the silicon valley for africa make it the place where african entrepreneurs in technology can be based and incubate their ideas raise funding and operate their tech companies from mauritius to deliver technology products and services to africa be it whether it s fintech proptech edutech healthtech africa has a lot techpreneurs and we have good legislations sound business environment decent infrastructure and here both public and private sector should team up to say how can we provide the african techpreneurs what they need to relocate to mauritius these techpreneurs would be keen to move to mauritius but we need to offer them a package and then go and find where they are be it in capetown nairobi lagos gaborone etc all the smart cities that are struggling to kick off because they are stuck with an old concept would then be able to position themselves to attract these techpreneurs all these offices that are sitting empty be it in port louis and ebène can also attract these techpreneurs this is as practical as it gets linked to the mauritius silicon valley is the positioning of mauritius as an eduation hub especially for africa the potential is enormous and the current number of students around 2000 is very low we have just scratched the surface we can easily accommodate 50 000 to 100 000 african students and the demand is there there s a huge and growing market for education in africa the more foreign students and universities in mauritius it creates an eco system to the transition to a knowledge and innovation economy and this feeds through to the concept of silicon valley for mauritius the way forward mauritius is quick fix and i mean it given the global uncertainty we need to have a cohesive vision that of placing mauritius as a safe place far from all these potential wars terrorism extremism and so on for a foreign investor we should be the preferred place to live to have a second home educate their kids do business have fun have leisure activities and retire we have pretty much all the ingredients but we need to have the right cooks to bake the best recipe to attract these foreign investors and here i would like to make a plea to the government we need to have experienced and solid board members on key institutions the same institutions that would be the catalyst to either upgrade the exist pillars of the economy for example tourism and financial services and also to allow the creation of new pillars of the economy put asides politics and bring the best brains and experienced mauritians and there are many of them out there that s why i believe with practical solutions getting experienced people at the helms of public institutions and a simplified vision for the next five years we can bring mauritius back to the much needed inclusive gdp growth of 5 by kevin

even as a bitter and partisan impeachment trial plays out in washington the signals emanating from the economy continue to be amazingly positive the unemployment rate is at record lows the stock market is near record highs corporate profits remain strong and growth at around 2 percent is the highest among advanced economies at some level this disconnect between economics and politics reflects the underlying strength of the u s economy the innovation the efficient use of labor and capital the quality of management that existed long before donald trump became president business and economic fundamentals don t change overnight but americans should understand that there will be a significant long term economic cost to our polarized politics and dysfunctional government which has now reached the point of near total breakdown of comity and cooperation between the parties between the houses of congress and among the various branches of government in the modern era there are few if any examples of a country with a healthy thriving economy and a broken political system what distinguishes a successful economy from a failing one what distinguishes denmark from italy and south korea from north is not how much capital it has or technology it produces but the quality of its institutions the laws rules norms and policies that create the framework in which any economy operates and there should be no doubt that as a result of broken politics the quality of the united states institutions is already on the decline advertisement we can see such deterioration in our inability to adapt to changing conditions the rise of china as an economic superpower the influx of economic and political refugees and the threat from global warming people will inevitably disagree about how to deal with these serious economic challenges but a country with a working political system would rather after a modest debate embrace the obvious compromises building on what works and fixing what doesn t in the united states by contrast our approach has been to deny the problem demonize those with whom we disagree and ostracize anyone who dares to compromise as a result we now have millions of blue collar workers who are idle or underemployed millions of unskilled immigrants who are here illegally and too few of the skilled immigrants we need our physical environment meanwhile is subject to an unending series of devastating floods wildfires droughts and other extreme weather events the cost in terms of lost output and economic damage runs to tens of billions of dollars every year we see our institutional decline in the persistence of a health care system that continues to cost twice as much as in other countries while delivering some of the worst health outcomes in the industrialized world the reasons are not seriously in dispute 1 too much care that is unnecessary and too little of the kind that keeps people healthy and 2 corporate profits and medical salaries that are higher than necessary to attract talent and incentivize investment and innovation for decades opposition from special interest groups prevented anything from being done when it finally was obamacare most of those same interests used everything within their power to make sure even this modest reform would not succeed advertisement economists anne case and angus deaton recently calculated the direct cost of all this overspending at about 1 trillion a year or 8 000 for every household in the country the indirect costs in terms of lost output due to preventable death and illness and lost sales on global markets because of excessive labor costs surely add hundreds of billions more we also see the effects of political dysfunction in the inability of congress to come anywhere near balancing the federal budget even when the economy is seemingly operating at capacity in reality our current economic boom is a keynesian mirage the only reason our economy is growing at all is that because of extravagant tax cuts and undisciplined spending the federal government last year spent 1 trillion more than it brought in in revenue even as the federal reserve injects an additional 60 billion a month into the financial system as the international monetary fund warned in its annual economic outlook last fall such a level of fiscal and monetary stimulus is not sustainable creating risks of inflation a spike in interest rates or a sharp decline in the value of the dollar any of which in turn could lead to a recession or financial crisis in the longer run this addiction to living beyond our means will also have the effect of making us ever more beholden to the foreign lenders and investors who make it possible advertisement it would be one thing if we were productively investing all this borrowed or freshly printed money rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure providing effective job training to displaced workers or improving educational outcomes of our children these are the kinds of high payoff public investments that a functioning political system would be making instead we are essentially throwing the money down the drain by using it to finance runaway defense spending and farm subsidies and extravagant tax cuts for businesses that have mostly been passed on to shareholders share this article share but perhaps the greatest threat to the u s economy is the deterioration in the rule of law that has become a hallmark of the trump presidency and now lies at the heart of the unfolding impeachment process global companies do not invest in countries with autocratic leaders who arbitrarily impose economic sanctions or punitive tariffs on longtime allies who fail to perform political favors or take a different approach to unrelated foreign policy issues advertisement and the experience of other countries tells us that households and businesses do not pay their full share of taxes where leaders boast about paying no taxes at all and do not adhere to immigration rules when leaders are seen to flagrantly violate them this is other countries right we know that competition does not thrive in countries where leaders threaten criminal prosecution of political opponents and fire diplomats and civil servants who expose their corruption nor do markets flourish in countries where tariff waivers are handed out to political allies government contracts are withheld from political critics government regulations are not enforced against campaign contributors and companies are subject to antitrust investigations for lobbying against government policies rule of law is eroded when judges who rule against the government are dismissed as political hacks when journalists who report the truth are deemed enemies of the people and any investigation of corruption is labeled a witch hunt advertisement it will be further undermined when a president who has done all of these things is acquitted and vindicated by a deeply partisan and feckless senate majority deterioration in the rule of law reckless fiscal policy and lack of public investment failure to fix a costly and underperforming health care system or address the challenges of globalization and climate change like the impeachment process now playing out at the capitol each is both a consequence of and contributor to our broken politics and like the impeachment process each will have negative long term impact on the quality of our institutions and the vibrancy of our economy trump impeachment trial begins stocks hit new high if the headline sounds too good to be true that s only because it probably is

president donald trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in davos on tuesday to make the case that ordinary americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration s america first maxim at the world economic forum in the swiss alps trump argued that a regime of tax cuts regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans trump said adding that the well being of the american worker was paramount on cnbc national economic council director larry kudlow echoed the president s assertions inequality is diminishing right now he said i think we re in a better place many mainstream economists hold a different opinion while low unemployment and steadily if slowly rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower income americans these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few the economic backdrop is such that people s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement it s debatable what all of that s attributable to said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com in spite of higher incomes significant wealth building among the middle class has not manifested mcbride pointed out more people are working more people are making money the extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security such as boosting emergency savings retirement savings or paying down debt is still unclear he said the republicans corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics the tax policy center says that two thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains he said i don t particularly feel that it s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape said scott cole founder and president of cole financial planning and wealth management economists point out that trump s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit a growth sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing even as the stock market has notched record highs there s no way that what s happening right now under a republican administration is fiscal conservatism cole said in his davos speech trump revisited another favorite topic negative interest rates they get paid to borrow money something i could get used to very quickly love that he said in reality negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary americans said karen shaw petrou managing partner of consulting firm federal financial analytics we know that they also destroy household savings and long term retirement security she said it s a move that supports stock markets not personal savings and to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual a large number of households have still been left behind mcbride said we ve seen scant evidence that americans en masse have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security he said regardless of what the headline is i would think it s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you re not participating in it cole said
based on 2019 figures about 78 of the global gdp of 86 31 billion is attributable to the sixteen economies in the trillion dollar club if we look even closer the top five countries in terms of nominal gdp the u s china japan germany and india contribute a whopping 55 to the world s gdp here s a look at how these five countries are poised to grow in 2020 united states the united states the world s largest economy with a nominal gdp of 21 44 trillion constitutes one fourth of the world economy the u s economy is primarily a service oriented economy with a 77 contribution to gdp with the jobless rate hitting record lows at 3 5 contribution to gdp coming from a majority 17 out of 22 of industry groups and the stock markets soaring at all time highs this has been a great period for the u s economy however problems linger with regards to its trading partners and trump s trade wars rising debt levels and its industrial output among other issues the trouble between the u s and china on trade is negatively impacting not just these two countries but many others a study by unctad concluded that consumers in the u s are bearing the heaviest brunt of the u s tariffs on china as their associated costs have largely been passed down to them and importing firms in the form of higher prices during 2018 the u s trade deficit with china was at 419 52 billion while it was at 320 82 billion during the first eleven months of 2019 in addition the u s current account deficit which reflects the combined balances on trade in goods and services and income flows between u s residents and residents of other countries was 124 1 billion during the third quarter of 2019 or 2 3 of u s gdp the imf sees u s gdp at 2 in 2020 and will decline further to 1 7 in 2021 the u s economy is set to grow to 25 8 trillion by 2024 with its gdp per capita at rising to 76 252 from the current 65 111 china china officially the people s republic of china is the second largest economy in the world and the fastest growing trillion dollar economy with a gdp of 14 14 trillion in 2019 it makes up 16 38 of the global economy when compared on the basis of purchasing power parity ppp china is the largest economy with a gdp ppp of 27 31 trillion based on 2019 figures the size of china s nominal gdp was lesser than that of u s by around 7 3 trillion the gap is expected reduce to around 4 5 trillion by 2024 china is on the path to become a 20 trillion economy by 2024 china has had trouble with the u s on the trade front a series of tariffs and counter retaliatory tariffs among other restrictions resulted in a trade war been the two biggest economies to avoid further escalation u s and china entered a trade deal in early 2020 which involves partial rollback of past tariffs and pause in additional tariff hikes in the first phase while the trade deal has alleviated near term cyclical weakness the unresolved disputes on broader china u s economic relations and ongoing structural showdown is likely to weigh on china s growth china is projected to grow at 6 in 2020 and by 5 8 in 2021 japan japan the third largest economy in the world contributes almost 6 to the global gdp the financial crisis of 2008 09 took a toll on the japanese economy it was the only major advanced economy that experienced negative economic growth in 2008 and continued to contract sharply in 2009 the impact of the sub prime crisis that originated in the u s on the japanese economy was majorly due to the severe impact on japan s exports the economy has remained fragile ever since when prime minister shinzo abe came to power in 2012 one of his priorities was to end deflation while ensuring fiscal discipline the initiatives to revive the economy have become popularly known as abenomics japan s gdp touched 5 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow at 0 7 in 2020 this is an upgrade from earlier estimates which comes on the back of the fiscal package of 122 billion announced in december 2019 japan s economy is expected to expand to 6 26 billion by 2024 based on current growth estimates japan has a healthy gdp per capita of 40 846 which is expected to rise to 50 637 by 2024 germany with a gdp of 3 86 trillion germany is the fourth largest economy in the world and the largest economy in europe the world bank estimates that approximately 47 4 of its gdp is dependent on the export of goods and services which makes it vulnerable to external shocks this became evident during the financial crisis of 2008 09 when the economy contracted by 5 7 2009 however ever since it has grown in each of the last ten years amid multiple challenges in the recent times the economy has been hit by the sluggish global trade declines in export orders and industrial production the continuing trade disputes and brexit uncertainty which have weighted on business confidence and investment scenario have further compounded the problems germany is projected to grow at 1 1 in 2020 and 1 4 in 2021 higher than 0 5 in 2019 by 2023 24 germany and india would be very close to each other in terms of the size of the nominal gdp making it a close contest for the spot of the fourth largest world economy although in terms of gdp per capita germany 46 563 is way ahead of india 2 171 india india the fifth largest economy has often been dubbed as the bright spot in the global economy has seen a substantial downgrade in its growth projection by the imf india s growth has been impacted by country specific issues such as stress in the non bank financial sector decline in credit growth cooling private consumption slowing industrial activity and stagnant investments steps such as the introduction of a goods and services tax an insolvency and bankruptcy code and measures to recapitalize public sector banks are being taken however a lot needs to be done to revive its economy especially in areas such as labor reforms and infrastructure to ensure that india is recognized as a strong contender in the global supply chain a 4 8 growth in 2019 has led the imf to the reassessment of growth prospects over the next two years which underpins india s contribution to global growth after a disappointing 2019 the imf projects india s gdp to expand by 5 8 in 2020 and 6 5 in 2021 on the assumption of adequate monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices based on current projections india is expected to become a 3 2 trillion economy in 2020 and reach 4 6 trillion by 2024 while india is the third largest economy in purchasing parity terms its rank drops

lexology gtdt market intelligence provides a unique perspective on evolving legal and regulatory landscapes this interview is taken from the m a volume featuring discussion and analysis of legal developments keynote deals as well as an insight into typrical transactions within key jurisdictions worldwide 1 what trends are you seeing in overall activity levels for mergers and acquisitions in your jurisdiction during the past year or so in the united states the first three quarters of 2018 saw a slight decline in the number of transactions but a flat to slightly increased value of announced transactions depending on which set of data is reviewed there was somewhere over 4 000 transactions announced in the first nine months of the year with an aggregate dollar value of approximately us 1 25 trillion to us 1 4 trillion however a somewhat deeper look at the dispersion of activity levels over the three quarters of the year shows a more nuanced story a strong first half of the year in terms of dollar value of announced transactions offset a significant drop off of activity in the third quarter with a particularly dramatic drop in september from prior months and year over year notably the first quarter of 2019 had over us 450 billion of deals the most in the first quarter in the past five years and the second quarter had over us 500 billion of activity essentially tied with the most of any quarter in the past five years deal activity then plummeted in the third quarter to the lowest level of any quarter in the past five years there was a similar pattern in last year s deal activity which also saw an extremely high level of transactions in the first half of the year and then a softening in the second half which was a shift from 2016 and 2017 in which the fourth quarter was the busiest of those years it remains to be seen how the fourth quarter of 2019 will develop however the trend of september showed a 25 per cent drop off from the prior month and was the lowest of the year a significant amount of the value of the transactions announced year to date and certainly any increase in value over the 2018 period has been due to an increase in mega deals in the first nine months of this year there have been over a dozen transactions with a value over us 20 billion announced in the united states however of those deals 10 were announced in the first half of the year and none in september highlighting the softening of market activity throughout the third quarter activity levels for the remainder of 2019 remain difficult to predict given the trends seen in the third quarter 2 which sectors have been particularly active or stagnant what are the underlying reasons for these activity levels what size are typical transactions the single busiest sector in the united states for transactions through the end of the 2019 third quarter was the healthcare sector which had approximately us 345 billion of deals announced perhaps a record for the sector and certainly the highest of the past five years the largest deal of the year is in the healthcare space which is the merger between celgene and bristol myers squibb was valued at approximately us 90 billion the third largest transaction of the year is also in the healthcare sector the us 84 billion merger between allergan and abbvie another notable mega deal in healthcare is the us 25 billion combination between the upjohn subsidiary of pfizer and mylan the energy sector which had led activity in the us during the first three quarters of 2018 had a decline of approximately 25 per cent in deal value in the same period in 2019 down to just over us 200 billion and was the second busiest area of deal activity this year to date the technology and industrials areas were each essentially flat to slightly up compared to 2018 in terms of announced deal value the overall value of deals in the industrials sector was somewhat skewed by the us 89 billion combination of raytheon and united technologies announced in june this general pattern of certain sectors being in favour and then cycling out and of other sectors increasing in activity has been the case for the past several years in the united states an exception had been energy mining and utilities transactions which had been relatively consistently busy over several years until this year the average transaction size has increased over the comparable period last year due to a decline in the number of deals but an increase in the number of deals over us 1 billion has led to a significant increase in average deal size to well over us 300 million 3 what were the recent keynote deals what made them so significant keynote deals in the united states in 2019 include the celgene combination with bristol myers squibb valued at us 90 billion the largest transaction announced globally year to date this will be the largest pharmaceutical acquisition of all time and will combine celgene a relatively young pharmaceutical company with bristol myer squibb itself the result of a merger 30 years ago of two old line pharmaceutical companies following closely behind the celgene bristol myers squibb deal in size in the same industry is the combination of allergan and abbvie which is valued at over us 80 billion there is now a history of many decades of waves of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry as companies have become globalised and the need to continually add to the pipeline of new drugs becomes evermore pressing these two transactions alone account for 10 per cent of the deal volume in the us in the first three quarters of 2019 also just behind the celgene bristol myers squibb deal in size is the acquisition of raytheon by united technologies for approximately us 89 billion united technologies is an industrial conglomerate that is spinning off two major businesses and refocusing on the defence industry raytheon is a significant defence contractor the theme of consolidation of global businesses applies to this sector as well as the pharmaceutical industry the celgene bristol myers squibb allergan abbvie and raytheon united technologies deals are emblematic of the commercial pressures that are driving much of the m a activity in the united states this year 4 in your experience what consideration do shareholders in a target tend to prefer are mergers and acquisitions in your jurisdiction primarily cash or share transactions are shareholders generally willing to accept shares issued by a foreign acquirer in the united states consideration can be composed of either stock cash or a combination of both for a target s shareholders obtaining shares as a portion of the consideration allows them to benefit from the synergies resulting from the transaction additionally if a majority of the consideration is composed of shares then the receipt of shares may be free of taxes however acquisitions by non us buyers of us public companies are generally entirely for cash inversion transactions have been the common exception to the use of all cash when the acquirer is a non us company in an inversion transaction however the combined business is generally viewed as being controlled by us persons and treated as such by the us securities and exchange commission sec the us stock exchanges and the stock market indices in this situation institutional shareholders in the united states such as pension funds foundations and university endowments are permitted to receive the shares of the non us buyer in situations where the non us buyer is truly under non us control such shareholders may be reluctant or even not permitted by their investment guidelines to hold shares of non us entities furthermore under us federal securities law public company shareholders in the united states may only receive shares as consideration for their existing shares that are issued by a company that is registered with the sec and that are publicly tradeable this means that a non us company that is not already a sec registrant must go through the steps necessary to become registered prior to the closing of a purchase of a us public company if shares are used as part of its consideration the time and expense of this process is a limitation on the ability and desire of non us purchasers to use shares as consideration for purchasing a us public company 5 how has the legal and regulatory landscape for mergers and acquisitions changed during the past few years in your jurisdiction key legal and regulatory developments in the united states in the past few years include the increase in scrutiny of non us buyers by the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius as to whether a potential purchase of a us company by a non us company creates any concerns from a potential us national security perspective with the full expansion of the scope of cfius now being implemented following a pilot programme during the last year the increase by us antitrust authorities in their level of scrutiny of certain kinds of corporate combinations and the increased willingness of us regulators to challenge transactions in court the severe restrictions placed on inversion transactions where a us company and a non us company merge and us shareholders make up the most significant portion of the shareholder base changes to us corporate tax law which make it far more acceptable for a us corporation to be the corporate parent of a global enterprise which introduces greater flexibility into structuring cross border transactions and a recent case in delaware the state where a majority of us public companies are incorporated where the delaware chancery court found for the first time that a buyer was justified in the termination a public company merger agreement due to the occurrence of a material adverse effect 6 describe recent developments in the commercial landscape are buyers from outside your jurisdiction common buyers from outside the united states are an important part of the us m a market the amount of inbound activity increased by almost 10 per cent in the first three quarters of 2019 to approximately us 228 billion this increase reverses a trend seen in the past several years when inbound m a activity from canada and china the two regions considered key bidders for us inbound m a fell bringing down overall inbound acquisitions the most significant inbound acquisition of the period is the london stock exchange s us 27 billion acquisition of refinitiv at the beginning of august of this year chinese buyers who by 2015 had become an important participant in the us m a market have stepped back from the us market due to increasing restrictions imposed by the chinese government on acquisitions by chines companies and due to the increasing level of scrutiny by us regulators of chinese buyers it is safe to assume that there is a tension on the part of potential non us buyers coming into the us between on the one hand general uncertainty around the political and regulatory climate in the united states and on the other hand an american economy which remains relatively stronger than those economies in other regions such as europe the significant uncertainty around us trade and foreign investment policy among other things has no doubt deterred some degree of m a activity in the united states and inbound cross border m a activity in particular 7 are shareholder activists part of the corporate scene how have they influenced m a shareholder activism in 2018 continues to be a regular part of the corporate world in both the united states and the rest of the world with over 300 companies being subject to activist demands for board representation so far in 2019 of which many were in connection with targets outside the united states shareholder activists are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their approach to board composition with many proposing high quality nominees to their slate of board directors further as institutional investors continue to adopt explicit qualifications for diversity in board representation whether through skill ethnic or gender diversity shareholder activists are provided with an opportunity to enhance the quality of a board s composition through diverse nominee selections using networks not accessible or otherwise not efficiently utilised by companies one regular aspect of activist campaigns is the urging of companies to put themselves up for sale or to put up for sale portions of their business this focus on m a by activists has had an important role in supporting the us m a market in recent years in addition to the transactions directly stimulated by activists many companies have engaged in transactions even before an activist has acquired a stake in that company to forestall such an appearance by an activist 8 take us through the typical stages of a transaction in your jurisdiction first contact regarding a possible transaction can either take place between intermediaries or from ceo to ceo who makes the initial approach really depends on the particular situation the nature of the industry and whether there is a pre existing relationship between executives of the two companies involved diligence of non public information is permissible if a confidentiality agreement is entered into between the parties under us law no disclosure of discussions regarding a possible transaction needs to be made until a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction is executed by the parties so long as the parties have maintained a position of not making any public comment about a possible transaction while negotiations were taking place one issue that typically arises at the state of entering into a confidentiality agreement is whether the potential seller will agree to grant to a prospective buyer the exclusive rights to negotiate with that prospective buyer for some period of time legally us sellers have the right to grant a period of exclusive negotiations however as a legal matter the board of directors of a public company being sold must also show that they engaged in an appropriate process intended to obtain the highest price reasonably available for that company some kind of check of the market by the prospective seller is necessary to truly fulfil that duty thus there is a tension between granting an exclusive right of negotiation and being able to fully assess the market for potential purchasers any potential purchaser of a us public company needs to be aware that lawsuits are frequently filed in connection with acquisitions of us public companies these lawsuits can be filed in the court of state of incorporation of the us company alleging either that the target company s board of directors has violated their fiduciary duties in connection with agreeing to a sale of the company or can file for an appraisal action if the shareholder has not voted for the sale of the company at a shareholders meeting in connection with the approval of the transaction or tendered their shares if the form of the transaction is a tender offer alternatively a lawsuit can be filed in a federal court alleging inadequate or misleading disclosure in the documents concerning the transaction that have been filed with the sec the majority of us companies are incorporated in the state of delaware and the delaware courts have been trying to severely limit the number of suits filed making specious claims that directors have violated their fiduciary duties the overwhelming number of these suits were simply nuisance suits appraisal claims have risen sharply in recent years but recent delaware court decisions are similarly trying to curb such suits 9 are there any legal or commercial changes anticipated in the near future that will materially affect practice or activity in your jurisdiction currently it is unclear if there will be legal changes that may have a material effect on m a practice or activity in the united states as of late october 2019 the trump administration has continued its aggressive stance towards foreign investment policy in the us by implementing a pilot programme by cfius to be effective from november the focus of this programme is the protection of national security from existing and emerging risks through the expansion and strengthening of cfius venture capitalists and start ups are likely to be hit the hardest by the programme as their unfamiliarity with cfius may cause them to be at risk of unintentionally failing to comply with the interim rules the risks are heightened by a civil monetary fine of us dollars to the value of the transaction such unfamiliarity may further lead to regulatory delay and a marked decline in investment from foreign limited partners that would want to avoid the hassles of heightened scrutiny where the pilot programme will require foreign investors to submit declarations notifying cfius of their intentions when making a bid under the expanded scope of the pilot programme non controlling investments in 27 critical technologies ranging from semiconductors to aircraft engines will be subject to national security evaluations provided certain benchmarks are satisfied including the presence of any involvement in substantive decision making further areas of regulation that may come under significant revision are the regulations with respect to banks and other financial services firms as significant changes are considered to the regulations promulgated under the dodd frank act which was enacted following the 2008 financial crisis and changes to sec regulations governing public disclosure by us public companies in connection with shareholder votes and takeovers both areas of regulation are undergoing substantial review by the current administration as they are also doing with respect to federal environmental regulation and regulation of telecommunications approval of new drugs and health and safety regulation there is no real certainty as to the timing and scope of any changes that may be implemented which makes it difficult to assess either the financial impact such changes might have on the valuation of us companies or the changes that might take place in the process or timing of carrying out the acquisition of a us company 10 what does the future hold what activity levels do you expect for the next year which sectors will be the most active do you foresee any particular geopolitical or macroeconomic developments that will affect deal sizes and activity in recent years the fourth quarter of the year has been particularly strong last year was an exception to this however we do not know if 2019 will repeat the weakened activity levels of 2018 or show the strength that prior years has shown in the fourth quarter it is very hard at this time to predict how activity levels will look in 2019 factors that should encourage m a activity are that debt remains cheap confidence in the equity and debt markets remains high and companies and financial buyers continue to have significant amounts of cash available with which to engage in m a activity sectors in which there should be significant amounts of activity include energy mining and utilities continuing that sector s current run of activity financial institutions as consolidation in the insurance and payments areas continues and the potential easing of the dodd frank rules lets pent up demand for consolidation among regional and local bank finally take place healthcare including hospitals outpatient facilities medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies all continuing the ongoing consolidation and convergence in those fields consumer retail which will increasingly need to consolidate to stave off the long collapse that was initially set off by the great recession and now continues due to the online competition and industrials and technology in large part because of the quickly ramping up convergence between those areas as industrial companies want to integrate with technology companies and vice versa to consider what geopolitical or macroeconomic developments could have an effect on m a activity is to engage in utter speculation the potential list of developments ranges from threats of nuclear war not seen for the past 25 years since the end of the cold war ongoing and pernicious threats of terrorism fears about the impact of higher interest rates on the economy and a prolonged us china trade war as well as additional natural disasters such as major hurricanes recently hitting the us and massive forest fires in california lastly 2020 is a presidential election year in the united states even in the most predictable of us election years there is often a pause in m a activity in the latter part of the year as 2020 progresses the uncertainty around the political outcomes in the us could grow thus leading to a more prolonged slowdown in m a activity thus any crystal ball as to future events and their impact remains cloudy the inside track what factors make mergers and acquisitions practice in your jurisdiction unique the size and complexity of many transactions in the us market together with the highly developed corporate law governing changes of control of us companies make the m a market here unique helping boards of directors properly fulfil their fiduciary obligations in connection with a sale of a company is challenging in the litigious environment of the united states what three things should a client consider when choosing counsel for a complex transaction in your jurisdiction first does the counsel listen and communicate well with the client second is there a complete team of specialists and colleagues who work together seamlessly to help the client achieve its goals third does the counsel have deep expertise with the kind of transaction under discussion successfully guiding complex multinational transactions is not for the novice what is the most interesting or unusual matter you have recently worked on and why i have been fortunate over the past year to have worked on a wide range of transactions that are each examples of the kinds of transformations taking place in a variety of industries among them have been deals selling the power business of johnson controls to an affiliate of brookfield asset management for approximately us 15 billion the business being sold is a global manufacturing business with assets and people in countries around the world which needed to be carved out of johnson controls overall operations the scope of regulatory and corporate law issues that needed to be addressed was truly complex and

results of both the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 particularly the 14 7 growth in net income the increase in net income was fueled by several strategic initiatives that included better loan yields higher fee income from the increase in transaction accounts as well as better than expected results for mortgage and investment sales income additionally we were able to hold noninterest expense to less than a 2 5 increase including a large onetime expense for taxes related to bringing our largest non performing loan into oreo in the third quarter smith added loan growth for the fourth quarter was solid at 2 3 which is 9 2 annualized and the pipeline for the first quarter of 2020 is very strong credit quality remains strong and the pipeline is diversified by loan type as well as spread across our geographic footprint smith concluded we continue to emphasize key metrics that will enhance shareholder returns this includes ways to leverage our capital as shown most recently in the increase in our common stock dividend and a new stock repurchase program our markets are large and diverse which will allow us to continue our controlled growth strategy and sustained strong earnings per share growth in 2020 results of operations overview linked quarter basis two separate items of note that impact comparative results occurred during the third quarter of 2019 the first item was a 1 1 million payoff of a loan within the pci portfolio the pci portfolio contains six separate pools two of which due to the uncertain nature of the cash flows have no carrying value this 1 1 million payoff was in one of those pools the acquisition development and construction adc pool resulting in the entire payment being interest income the other item was the migration of a 4 0 million nonperforming loan charged down by 200 000 and moved into the other real estate owned oreo category at 3 8 million as a part of this transaction the bank paid delinquent real estate taxes in the

with 13 4 million for the quarter ended september 30 2019 the decrease of 1 0 million was mainly attributable to the 1 1 million pci loan payoff in the third quarter interest and dividend income on a

million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2 3 million in the third quarter of 2019 the increase in income in the pci portfolio in the third quarter was driven by the 1 1 million loan payoff interest income on securities decreased 128 000 on a linked quarter basis as the average balance on the portfolio declined 16 0 million securities income equaled 1 8 million on a tax equivalent basis for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with 1 9 million in the third quarter of 2019 a decrease of 136 000 the tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was 3 15 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared

taxable and tax exempt securities due to the current rate environment and 6 8 million in municipal bonds were called during the fourth quarter of 2019 this is having a negative impact on the yield realized on the portfolio the combination of various tax equivalent yields within the asset mix resulted in a yield on earning assets of 4 90 for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with 5 23 in the third quarter of 2019 the receipt of cash basis income on the pci portfolio due to improved economic conditions subsequent to the acquisition date in 2009 has resulted in better than forecasted performance and may produce recurring but unpredictable income over the remaining life of these loans excluding the 1 1 million payment in the third quarter the yield on the pci portfolio would have been 13 82 compared with the actual yield of 26 07 the yield on earning assets would have been 4 90 in the third quarter compared with the actual yield of 5 23 the yield on earning assets in the fourth quarter was 4 90 interest expense of 3 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected a decrease of 177 000 or 4 4 on a linked quarter basis interest on deposits decreased 183 000 or 4 9

in the third quarter of 2019 to 1 43 in the fourth quarter of 2019 the interest spread which is reflective of the yield on earning assets less the cost of interest bearing liabilities was 3 47 in the fourth quarter of 2019 this compares with an interest spread of 3 74 in the third quarter excluding the pci payment the interest spread would have been 3 41 in the third quarter the net interest margin was 3 74 in the fourth quarter of 2019 the net interest margin was 4 02 in the third quarter of 2019 and excluding the pci payment would have been 3 70 yearly comparison 2019 versus 2018 net

for 2019 driving the increase was growth of 46 3 million or 8 0 in the average balance of time deposits from 581 6 million for 2018 to 627 9 million for 2019 this growth in time deposits as a result of higher rates came partly from a shift away from savings and money market accounts which experienced a decline of 8 8 million in average balances between the comparison periods additionally time deposit growth included a shift out of fhlb and other borrowings which reflected an average balance decline of 25 3 million or 27 8 over the two comparison periods the tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 82 for 2019 compared with 3 76 for 2018 the yield on earning assets increased by 28 basis points over this time frame the competition for funding however pushed the cost of interest

million for the fourth quarter of 2019 was a year over year decrease of 234 000 interest income on securities on a tax equivalent basis was 1 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 which was a decrease of 282 000 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 this decrease was driven both by average balance and yield the average balance of the securities portfolio decreased 23 0 million year over year additionally on a tax equivalent basis the yield on investment securities decreased from 3 31 in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 3 15 in the fourth quarter of 2019 interest expense increased 449

of 2018 to 1 40 in the fourth quarter of 2019 fhlb and other borrowings increased on average 3 8 million year over year which was more than offset by a decrease in the rate paid from 2 08 in the

in this nov 6 2019 photo visitors chat near american and chinese flags displayed at a booth for an american company promoting environmental sensors during the china international import expo in shanghai president trump signed a trade deal with china last week last week was a good week for u s trade relations and the state of international trade globally the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the successor pact to the impugned north american free trade agreement passed the u s senate by a vote of 89 10 after making it through the house of representatives last month last week also saw the united states and china ink a deal that reduced much of the punitive tariffs each country has erected against the other provided some protection of intellectual property rights lessened mandatory technology transfer rules that force u s companies which do business in china to share their technology with chinese companies and introduced some chinese actions against the country s companies which engage in corporate espionage in these important historic in his words initiatives president donald trump was able to fulfill two of his campaign promises at least nominally to negotiate a better trade agreement with china and rework the north american free trade agreement nafta to better protect u s workers and u s corporations but like everything else the devil is in the details the deals are no panaceas advertisement the uscma deal is better than no deal from the moment he announced his candidacy for president trump threatened to exit nafta calling it the worst trade deal in history nafta the original deal among the u s canada and mexico has been the bedrock of the north american vertically integrated economies for a quarter century and allowed us to enjoy economies of scale and to better compete with european and asian companies it also provided for a dispute resolution system to protect foreign investors among the three partner countries an arbitral mechanism in which the u s never lost nafta worked much as intended facilitating economic growth and while the new usmca does update commercial activities covered including digital trade the truth is that most nonpartisan watchdogs maintain that it will take years for u s workers and companies to gain from the new trade pact at least environmental and labor issues were included in the main framework this time around even so senate minority leader charles schumer and sens kamala harris and bernie sanders voted against the new pact claiming that the usmca did too little to protect u s workers or deal with climate change advertisement the usmca does not go into force until canada s parliament votes on the new deal at the end of the month with mexico s congress already having approved the revised pact mexico had initially balked at proposed provisions that encroached on its sovereignty as the usmca provided for u s inspectors to visit mexican factories to ensure the rights of organized labor are protected the rights of chinese labor did not factor so much into the new arrangement that president trump signed with chinese vice premier liu he last week phase i undoes some of the tariffs that each country has slapped on the other since 2017 the tariffs on 120 billion of chinese goods are to be halved to 7 5 and new tariffs will be suspended but not all of them u s tariffs on 370 billion worth of goods three quarters of the total remain in place the deal does commit china to purchasing much more u s agricultural goods going forward a great benefit for a large pro trump constituency in rural america however previous such promises have been largely unfulfilled this is merely phase i of a new deal it gets us back to pre trade war in many cases rather than ahead phase ii sure to be a prolonged and arduous process of negotiation with the second largest economy in the world will seek to address the real structural and difficult issues that have rankled the u s for years china s state subsidies for its massive technology companies like tencent huawei and baidu have long been a bone in the throat of washington d c and u s corporations china s national industrial policy has targeted industries like artificial intelligence autonomous vehicles robotics and semi conductor chip manufacturing with massive capital infusions from china s treasury to carve out a leadership role advertisement phase ii will occur after the u s presidential elections in november giving more time to beijing to continue its economic military and political support of its state owned enterprises and making its dominance over emerging technologies assured neither of last week s trade deals means that the trump administration is going to be any more multilateral in its approach to the global trading system nor abandon its beggar thy neighbor policies a trade war with the european union is brewing punitive tariffs on many goods from other countries continue and the world trade organization s dispute resolution system something that the u s promoted and created in the 1990s is failing due to the u s stonewalling new judges from being appointed all the while china has poured trillions of dollars into infrastructure and investment projects around the world linking 71 countries into china s economic orbit now that s historic advertisement cooper is a professor at california western school of law where he teaches international law and international trade law he has advised both the u s department of state and los pinos mexico s executive branch

touched an intraday high of usd1 3174 against the dollar in the wake of positive uk purchasing managers index data the seasonally adjusted ihs markit cips flash uk services purchasing managers index posted 52 9 in january up sharply from 50 0 in december and was the highest reading since september 2018 any reading below 50 indicates contraction while one above expansion in addition the flash uk manufacturing purchasing managers index ticked up to 49 8 in january from 47 5 in december and was at its highest level since april the uk composite output index rose to 52 4 in january from 49 3 in december climbing above the 50 0 no change mark for the first time since august however the pound subsequently retreated as investors look ahead to the bank of england s monetary policy meeting next week amid fears the central bank may cut interest rates analysts at rabobank said we expect the bank of england to cut its benchmark interest rate from 0 75 to 0 50 at next week s meeting the ois market currently reflects a 50 probability of such a move the consensus among analysts is for a hold in rates a variety of pmi surveys show that business optimism has recovered a bit following prime minister boris johnson s decisive election victory but we find it hard to believe that this optimism will either be sustained or translated into increased levels of activity if the mpc feels otherwise and therefore decides to keep bank rate on hold it won t be long before a cut is on the table again the euro stood at usd1 1025 at the european equities close down from usd1 1036 late thursday after

manufacturing pmi hit a nine month high of 47 8 from 46 3 though with a reading below 50 the sector is still contracting analysts at oxford economics said this week ended on a bittersweet note for the eurozone while the recovery in manufacturing activity in january is welcome news weaker services activity means that the european economy continues to grow at a moderate pace at the start of 2020 the easing of global trade tensions and the removal of some of the brexit related uncertainty means that manufacturing can finally crawl out of its deep slump however risks are never far away and we expect the threat of potential us tariffs on the european auto industry to continue to pose a substantial risk to the outlook against the yen the dollar was trading at jpy109 36 flat from jpy109 39

executive officer thank you matt and good morning everyone 2019 was a terrific year for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners nextera energy s performance was strong both financially and operationally and we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company by successfully executing on our plans nextera energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of 8 37 up 8 7 from 2018 over the past 15 years we ve now delivered compound annual growth in adjusted eps of nearly 8 5 which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 4 over the same period amidst the significant growth the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry in 2019 we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43 significantly outperforming both the s p 500 and the s p 500 utilities index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one three five seven and 10 year basis over the past 15 years we have outperformed all of the other companies in the s p utilities index and 85 of the companies in the s p 500 while more than tripling the total shareholder return of both indices although we are proud of our long term track record of creating shareholder value we remain utterly focused on the future and committed to continuing that track record going forward during 2019 fpl successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan including placing the highly efficient okeechobee clean energy center and an additional 300 megawatts of cost effective solar in service on time and on budget smart capital investments such as these help fpl improve its already best in class customer value proposition despite customer bills that were already nearly 30 below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of florida earlier this month the typical fpl residential customer bill decreased by nearly 4 or roughly 4 fpl had continued success with its cost savings initiatives reducing its already best in class dollar per retail megawatt hour non fuel o m costs by more than 5 year over year these ongoing cost savings combined with the flexibility afforded by fpl s current settlement agreement enabled fpl to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly 260 million of storm restoration costs related to hurricane dorian in addition to low bills fpl delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation finally last quarter we were pleased that following an extensive and thorough 18 month review the nuclear regulatory commission granted turkey point units 3 and 4 their second 20 year license extensions these units are the first nuclear power plants in the united states to achieve this milestone and this decision supports the continued production of clean zero emission reliable and affordable nuclear power in florida for many years to come beyond executing on its strategic initiatives during 2019 fpl positioned itself well for continued long term growth early in the year fpl announced its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan which is one of the world s largest solar expansions and will result in roughly 10 000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on fpl s solar system fpl system this solar expansion combined with low cost battery storage solutions such as the manatee energy storage center that was announced during 2019 represent the next phase of fpl s generation modernization efforts and are expected to further reduce fpl s co2 emissions rates which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30 since 2005 in addition to the terrific progress in generation during the year florida past the public utility storm protection plans law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments including undergrounding this new law supports continued hardening of fpl s already storm resilient energy grid and allows fpl to pursue these investments in a programmatic manner over the course of decades while deploying billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers we expect the final rules related to the new law to take effect later this quarter and that fpl will seek to begin clause recovery of its storm hardening investments beginning in 2021 with terrific visibility into significant investment programs such as these we remain as confident as ever about fpl s ability to sustain its long term growth trajectory while further improving our customers value proposition the energy resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2019 the renewables origination success remained particularly strong with the team adding more than 5 800 megawatts to our backlog over the past year as we continue operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history our ongoing renewables origination success results from our ability to leverage energy resources competitive advantages including our best in class development skills large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions strong customer relationships purchasing power best in class construction expertise resource assessment capabilities strong access to and cost of capital advantages and world class operations capability more than 50 of the solar megawatts that were added to our backlog in 2019 including a battery storage component and the current backlog is more than 2 000 megawatts of trifecta projects that combined wind solar and battery storage together we also increasingly see storage as an important stand alone business in its own right as we were viewing a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the itc and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers this highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution as well as energy resources unique skills to combine the three technologies into integrated near firm low cost products energy resources significant competitive advantages position it well to capitalize on the enormous disruption that is occurring to the nation s generation fleet we continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives new near firm wind is going to be a 20 to 30 per megawatt hour product and new near firm solar is going to be a 30 to 40 per megawatt hour product at these prices new near firm renewables will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal nuclear less efficient oil and gas fire generation units we were pleased by the 60 ptc extension that was passed in 2019 and we expect that will support incremental wind demand in 2023 and 2024 our confidence in renewables being the low cost generation alternative in the middle of this decade remains stronger than ever we expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade let me now turn to gulf power and highlight how we executed in 2019 against some of the long term objectives that we outlined at last year as we ve often discussed two of the key hallmarks of the nextera energy playbook are reduced operating costs and using those savings to fund smart capital investments for our customers after one year of ownership we are well on our way to executing this strategy at gulf power in 2019 we reduced gulf power s o m costs by approximately 20 year over year in addition to lowering costs we ve also identified smart investment opportunities to benefit customers in 2019 gulf power invested approximately 730 million or roughly 2 5 times gulf power s average capital investment amount over the past five years and was able to grow regulatory capital employed at roughly 11 year over year beyond realizing operating efficiencies and deploying smart capital in the past year gulf power was able to meaningfully improve its customer value proposition gulf power achieved its best ever service reliability year which was approximately 20 better than its 2018 results customer service was also better with notable improvements in speed of answer in florida public service commission complaints there is nothing more important in our company than the safety of our employees we made significant improvements in this area in 2019 as well with an approximately 40 reduction in our osha rate at gulf power versus 2018 as the major capital investments that we advanced during 2019 come into service in 2020 and beyond they will help achieve the other key objectives that we have outlined at gulf power such as meaningful emissions reductions and perhaps most importantly a significant reduction in customer bills in real terms in addition to creating tremendous customer value we expect that execution of the plans we laid out at gulf power will also generate great outcomes for our shareholders as well in our first year of ownership gulf power s adjusted earnings increased by 25 year over year this outcome was even better than our plan at the start of the year and positions us well to deliver on the financial growth objectives that we outlined when we announced the acquisition this high level performance across the board would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all gulf power employees while we are pleased with the results that we ve achieved at gulf power during 2019 we remain focused on the significant execution ahead of us here to deliver even greater value to our customers and our shareholders finally we were once again honored to be named for the 13th time in 14 years number 1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on fortune s list of most admired companies as well as ranked among the top 10 companies worldwide across all industries for social responsibility during 2019 alone nextera energy made approximately 13 billion in capital investments in american energy infrastructure making us one of the top capital investors in the u s in any industry none of these recognitions nor our track record of success would be possible without the hard work and commitment to excellence of our people who live our core value of doing the right thing every day in the last year there has been an increasing focus on the esg on the part of many of our stakeholders the fact is our company has been focused on all of the elements of esg for more than 25 years we are proud of our track record here but there is still so much more to do in this country to decarbonize the electric transportation in industrial sectors nextera energy is living proof that you can be clean and low cost and financially successful all at the same time we will be at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector we expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful co2 emissions reductions across the country while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and our continued investments in clean energy will help advance nextera energy toward its goal of reducing its co2 emissions rate by 67 by 2025 from a 2005 baseline in summary i continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about nextera energy s long term growth prospects in 2019 we extended our long term track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best in class organic growth prospects based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses i will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020 2021 and 2022 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years let me now turn to nextera energy partners which also had a terrific year of execution in 2019 in the more than five years since the ipo nextera energy partners has consistently delivered on its commitments that execute that history of execution is supported by nextera energy partners outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets which grew significantly and was further diversified in 2019 during the year nextera energy partners acquired a portfolio of more than 600 megawatts of wind and solar assets from energy resources additionally during the fourth quarter nextera energy partners closed down the acquisition of meade pipeline company which owns an approximately 40 aggregate interest in central penn line an intrastate natural gas pipeline in pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14 year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk finally during the year nextera energy partners advanced an additional organic growth opportunity announcing the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects we are proud that 2019 is the first year that nextera energy partners successfully executed on all of the three ways it can grow organically acquiring assets from third parties and acquiring assets from energy resources portfolio highlighting the clear flexibility and visibility into growth going forward to support the ongoing growth investments and optimize the capital structure for the benefit of lp unitholders nextera energy partners completed a number of financings and refinancings in 2019 as well at the start of the year nextera energy partners faced headwinds related to the pg e bankruptcy the team immediately focused on managing and mitigating the negative impacts of this event and we ended 2019 having favorably addressed many of the challenges the energy resources portfolio acquisition and associated financing that we announced last march allowed nextera energy partners to complete its original 2019 growth objectives even after excluding pg e related project cash flows during the year nextera energy partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our genesis project in addition to resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution through the removal of project level debt service as a result of the purchase of the debt nextera energy partners received approximately 128 million of distributions that had been or were expected to be restricted at the project the release of this cash was used to partially fund the debt repurchase i remain confident about a long term favorable resolution for our pg e related assets in addition to growing lp distributions by 15 year over year and achieving a run rate adjusted ebitda range in excess of what was originally expected nextera energy partners year end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations assuming full contributions from pg e related projects represents approximately 60 growth from the comparable year end 2018 run rate range with this strong year over year growth in cash available for distribution nextera energy partners expects to be able to achieve its long term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021 as of year end 2020 we expect to have achieved nextera energy partners distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the mid 70s range even after excluding cash distributions from our desert sunlight projects nep delivered an attractive total unitholder return of approximately 28 in 2019 further advancing its history of value creation since the ipo i continue to believe that the combination of nep s clean energy portfolio growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offer lp unitholders an attractive investor value proposition as with nextera energy we remain focused on continuing to execute and delivering that unitholder value over the coming years i ll now turn the call over to rebecca who will review the 2019 results in more detail rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning everyone let s now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the fourth quarter of 2019 fpl reported net income of 400 million or 0 81 per share down 0 04 per share year over year for the full year 2019 fpl reported net income of 2 33 billion or 4 81 per share an increase of 0 26 per share versus 2018 regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8 3 for 2019 and was the principal driver of fpl s net income growth of roughly 8 for the full year during the fourth quarter growth from new investments was offset by a number of factors including a contribution to our charitable foundation that should fund its operations for the next several years fpl s capital expenditures were approximately 2 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly 5 8 billion fpl s reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11 6 for the 12 months ending december 31 2019 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6 to 11 6 under our current rate agreement during the fourth quarter we utilized a total of 18 million of reserve amortization including the approximately 260 million that was utilized to offset hurricane dorian storm restoration costs leaving fpl with a year end 2019 balance of 893 million we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for one additional year and as a result expect to file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in january of 2022 while we have not made a final decision based on our review we expect that the merging of fpl and gulf power and making a single rate case filing will result in customer benefits and we therefore see this as a likely approach for the filing at this time all of our major capital projects at fpl are progressing well the 10 solar sites totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across fpl s service territory are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to fpl customers in early 2020 to support the significant solar expansion that fpl is leading across florida we have secured sites that could support 10 gigawatts of future projects earlier this month florida public service commission held hearings on fpl s proposed solar together program we continue to expect a decision about the proposed program at the end of the first quarter beyond solar construction on the highly efficient roughly 1 200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operations date in 2022 we continue to expect that fpl s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate of regulatory capital employed of approximately 9 from 2018 through 2022 while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition let me now turn to gulf power which reported fourth quarter 2019 gaap and adjusted earnings of 23 million and 26 million respectively or 0 05 per share for the full year gulf power reported gaap earnings of 180 million or 0 37 per share and adjusted earnings of 200 million or 0 41 per share as a reminder during the first 12 months following the closing of the acquisition we excluded one time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings additionally interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in corporate and other gulf power s reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10 8 for the 12 months ending december 2019 which is in the upper half of the allowed band of 9 25 to 11 25 under its current rate agreement for the full year 2020 we expect to target a regulatory roe near the upper end of its allowed band assuming normal weather and operating conditions as jim discussed the overall execution of gulf power s capital program is advancing well gulf power s first solar development project the roughly 75 megawatt blue indigo solar energy center is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime all of the other major capital investments including the north florida resiliency connection and the plant crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track the florida economy remains healthy as florida s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation according to recent irs data florida attracted a net gain of roughly 16 billion in personal taxable income in 2018 by far the highest of any state in the country and the fastest rate of growth as well which is a reflection of the attraction of florida s low tax pro business policies florida s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3 1 below the national average and at the lowest level in the decade florida has now added nearly 2 million private sector jobs over the last 10 years leading indicators in the real estate sector have remained at a stable pace reflecting continued strength of the florida housing market other positive economic data across the state include continued strength in retail taxable sales as well as the consumer confidence index which remains near 10 year highs during the quarter fpl s average number of customers increased by approximately 100 000 from the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of vero beach s roughly 35 000 customers late last year for 2019 fpl s retail sales increased 1 7 from the prior year driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison on a weather normalized basis fpl s retail sales declined by 0 6 as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer the decline in underlying usage was a reversal from the trend that fpl experienced in 2018 when underlying usage increased by 1 7 as we previously noted usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly strong weather conditions similar to those experienced during 2019 which makes distinguishing between underlying usage changes and weather impacts challenging for gulf power the average number of customers increased slightly versus the comparable prior year quarter as it moves beyond the impacts of hurricane michael in 2018 for 2019 gulf power s retail sales declined slightly due to unfavorable weather and a small decline in underlying usage per customer let me now turn to energy resources beginning with a reporting change in our segments given the trans bay cable acquisition during 2019 we have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our competitive transmission business and the management of these projects within our company our reporting for energy resources now includes the results of our nextera energy transmission projects formerly reported in corporate and other segment our 2018 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes resulting in increase in energy resources full year 2018 adjusted eps of 0 09 per share incorporating the reporting change energy resources reported fourth quarter 2019 gaap earnings of 433 million or 0 88 per share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 326 million or 0 66 per share energy resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased 0 01 versus the prior year comparable period as strong underlying growth from new and existing investments was more than offset by a number of number of items including the negative 0 14 adjusted eps impact of our refinancing activities which were primarily related to financing breakage costs associated with several wind repowerings as well as energy resources share of cost associated with the acquisition of the outstanding genesis debt as a reminder while these financing refinancing activities created a reduction in fourth quarter adjusted earnings they are expected to translate to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders for the full year energy resources reported gaap earnings of 1 81 billion or 3 72 per share and adjusted earnings of 1 7 billion or 3 49 per share energy resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased 0 35 or approximately 11 versus 2018 for the full year growth was driven by continued additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by 0 55 per share contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by 0 13 versus the prior year also contributing favorably were the customer supply and trading business where our contributions increased by 0 05 versus 2018 and nextera energy transmission which increased results 0 04 year over year primarily as a result of the trans bay cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019 these favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense reflecting the negative 0 14 adjusted eps impact in the fourth quarter refinancing activities as well as growth in the business and lower contributions from the existing generation assets in 2019 wind resource was 96 of the long term average down from 97 a year earlier additional details are shown on the accompanying slide in 2019 energy resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind solar and battery storage projects commissioning approximately 2 700 megawatts of renewables projects in the us including repowering since the call we since the last call we have added 1 609 megawatts renewables projects to our backlog including approximately 500 megawatts of combined new wind and repowering 700 megawatts of solar and 340 megawatts of battery storage all of which will be paired with new solar projects energy resources has now placed a total of approximately 3 700 megawatts of repowering projects in service since 2017 which represents approximately one third of its operating wind portfolio as of year end 2016 we expect that by the end of 2020 more than 60 of energy resources operating wind projects will have been originally commissioned or repowered within the last five years highlighting the young age of the overall fleet and the expected long date future value creation of the portfolio following the terrific origination year in 2019 and with nearly three years remaining in the period we are now within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year for the post 2022 period our backlog is already more than 2 400 megawatts placing us far ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage the accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands beyond renewables as of year end 2019 the mountain valley pipeline was approximately 90 complete we have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for the pipeline and we continue to make good progress on these efforts we expect that the issues related to mvp s biological opinion and nationwide 12 permit will be resolved in the spring allowing construction work along much of the route to resume we also remain hopeful that the supreme court will overturn the fourth circuit court s original decision on atlantic coast pipeline s case related to its appalachian trail crossing authorization resolving similar challenges for mvp we continue to target a full in service date for the pipeline during 2020 and an overall project cost estimate of approximately 5 4 billion turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy for the fourth quarter of 2019 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 975 million or 1 99 per share nextera energy s fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 706 million or 1 44 per share respectively for the full year 2019 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 3 77 billion or 7 76 per share adjusted earnings were 4 06 billion or 8 37 per share for the corporate and other segment adjusted earnings for the full year decreased 0 35 per share compared to the 2018 prior comparable period primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the gulf power acquisition financing nextera energy also delivered strong operating cash flow growth which increased at a faster rate than the adjusted eps growth rate as expected during 2019 we also maintained our strong credit position based on the s p methodology we estimate that we ended the year at a 22 5 ffo to debt level versus our current downgrade threshold of 21 for moody s we expect 2019 cfo pre working capital to debt was 19 6 versus our current downgrade threshold of 18 nextera energy s cushion versus our credit metrics reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and supports the record roughly 14 billion of capital investments that we expect to make in 2020 the financial expectations that we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged we continue to expect that nextera energy s adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6 to 8 through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 plus the accretion of 0 15 and 0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2020 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 8 70 to 9 20 and as jim highlighted we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range this year we do expect that our adjusted eps growth will be more weighted toward the second half of the year for 2022 we expect to grow adjusted eps in the range of 6 to 8 off 2021 adjusted eps translating to a range of 10 00 to 10 75 per share from 2018 to 2022 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range as always all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions let me now turn to nextera energy partners which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2019 fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 280 million and cash available for distribution was 101 million an increase of 70 and 130 respectively this strong growth was driven primarily by the significant year over year growth in nextera energy partners portfolio including the 2019 acquisitions of the energy resources assets and the meade pipeline company as well as the full quarter s contribution from the portfolio of projects that were acquired in late 2018 for the full year 2019 adjusted ebitda was 1 1 billion up 25 year over year cash available for distribution excluding all contributions from our desert sunlight projects was 366 million an increase of 8 from the prior year including full contributions from the desert sunlight projects nextera energy partners achieve cafd growth of 20 versus 2018 similar to the quarterly results full year growth in both adjusted ebitda and cafd was primarily driven by portfolio growth the benefit from new projects was partially offset by the divestiture of canadian assets during 2018 cash available for distribution was also reduced by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results include the impact of idr fees which we treat as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide yesterday the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of 0 535 per common unit or 2 14 per unit on an annualized basis up 15 from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2019 as jim mentioned during 2019 nextera energy partners executed several financing for the benefit of lp unitholders in addition to raising approximately 1 2 billion of unsecured holding company notes which priced at some of the lowest spreads ever in the sector nextera energy partners also raised 1 4 billion of low cost project finance debt and executed 1 3 billion revolver extension nextera energy partners also raised 1 8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings with low initial coupons the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to lp unitholders allowing nextera energy partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth which will also as a result lower future financing needs in addition to reduced future asset and equity needs these financings provide nextera partners the flexibility to convert into common units at no discount over a long period of time this should be accretive to lp unitholders who retain all of the unit price upside as nextera energy partners executes on its expected distribution growth objectives these attributes combined with the significant flexibility that nextera partners retains those financings including the timing of conversion option to convert at any price option to pay the buyout in cash rather than units and the option to deploy the buyout amount into other assets should generate significant value to lp unitholders while also providing significant downside protection finally last quarter following the achievement of certain nextera energy partners unit trading thresholds we converted the second tranche of the convertible preferred securities that we issued in 2017 into additionally an additional roughly 4 7 million nextera energy partners common units further supporting our ongoing goal of using low cost financing products to layer in equity over time the nextera energy partners portfolio at year end 2019 supports the revised adjusted ebitda and cafd december 31 2019 run rate expectations that we announced at the time of the meade acquisition since nextera energy partners long term distribution growth expectations are supported without the need of additional asset acquisitions until 2021 the december 31 2020 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda and cafd remain unchanged at the same levels as the year end 2019 run rate expectations including full contributions from the pg e related projects year end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of 560 million to 640 million reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020 and assuming normal weather and operating conditions excluding all contributions from the desert sunlight projects nextera energy partners continues to expect a year end 2020 run rate for cafd in the range of 505 million to 585 million year end 2020 run rate adjusted ebitda expectations which assume full contributions from pg e related projects as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized are 1 225 billion to 1 4 billion as a reminder all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of 2 14 we continue to see 12 to 15 growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024 we expect that the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in february of 2021 to be in the range of 2 40 to 2 46 per common unit in summary we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have excellent prospects for growth fpl gulf power energy resources and nextera energy partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board the progress we made in 2019 reinforces our long term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute on in 2020 we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we ll open up the line for questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen at this time we ll begin the question and answer session our first question today comes from greg gordon from evercore isi please go ahead with your question greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks congratulations on another very very consistent year performance rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks greg good morning greg gordon evercore isi analyst couple of questions for you based on my back of the envelope math it doesn t look like you earned at the maximum allowable roe at florida power light this year can you tell us what where you landed on a return on equity basis for fiscal year 19 rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah greg from a reported regulatory roe standpoint so what ultimately goes to the florida public service commission we did earn the 11 6 roe as allowed under our settlement agreement you are right we did have some below the line expenses which is typical but those below the line expenses are excluded from that regulatory roe calculation greg gordon evercore isi analyst got you understood and then when you you point out in your slide deck that the majority of your the majority of your ptcs are now being allocated through tax equity there is a very clear slide in the appendix on that that means that we should be looking at nci on the balance sheet flowing through the income statement as the way that that s flowing through earnings now is that correct rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes that s correct greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay and the average amortization of a tax equity deal for a wind project is what approximately 10 years is that is that right rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah the earnings recognition is roughly coincident with the 10 year ptc range that are for all of our wind projects that are in ptcs greg gordon evercore isi analyst right and for solar deal that would be slightly faster rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah it s typically relates to the recognition of the itc period so for many tax equity structures that s over five years certain tax equity partners prefer a seven year structure and so then it would be over seven years as opposed to five greg gordon evercore isi analyst right and as you guys gear up for preparing for rate case in 2021 are there any milestones this year or will the majority of the activity be happening in early 21 rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer as you certainly appreciate there is a ton of milestones that are largely internal for our teams as they get ready for any rate proceeding and many of those preparation efforts started well before this year and are ongoing and we have the incremental work this year of doing all the analysis of thinking about bringing fpl and gulf together but as i highlighted in the prepared remarks based on what we know today our expectation is that we would file a rate case in early 21 for the new rates effective in 2022 and you know the first start of that would be the filing of the test year letter which we would expect to file in early 21 greg gordon evercore isi analyst great my last question is the battery storage backlog is obviously continuing to ramp are you buying battery storage sort of from are you buying the product from another vendor or are you buying the components from different oems and building your own bespoke battery storage product in other words are you using a vendor like fluence or one of the other sort of total product companies or are you sourcing components and building your own battery units rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s much more of the latter greg we see tremendous amount of value and are being able to have some nimbleness in where we procure the battery packs but then we also are procuring separately as you suggested the things like the containers and the other equipment that you would ultimately use to assemble the battery facility and then also we re designing our own management systems we ultimately believe that some of the real value add that we re going to be able to add to customers that will likely differentiate us from others is that battery system management because we ve talked about with you guys and with others over time that there is probably not one value stream that creates the value for batteries it s usually a couple of different applications within the same system and that management system and optimizing that is going to be part of the secret sauce of batteries so we ve invested a lot of time and energy and thinking through that not only on the energy resources deployments but also for the deployments that we ve had at fpl and we ve learned a tremendous amount and we re really excited as we highlighted in the prepared remarks about batteries as a terrific supplement to further renewables deployment certainly in the middle part of the next decade and thereafter as renewables become a significant component of the generation stack in the u s power markets greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks a lot rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research please go ahead with your question steve fleishman wolfe research analyst yeah hi good morning just a question first if you could update us on the santee cooper situation and your interest there and then secondly with jea now gone and stock obviously doing very well just kind of overall thought process on m a strategy and opportunities right now thanks james l robo chairman and chief executive officer so steve this is jim i ll take that obviously we re pretty limited in what we can say about the santee cooper situation other than what i ve said previously which is we remain very interested in santee cooper and we think south carolina is a terrific place to do business and that s probably all i can say about that on the jea front i would say we re disappointed that the sale process has been terminated we think we could have brought enormous value to the customers of and the citizens of jacksonville and we think it s unfortunate that it s been terminated but it is that is what it is and in terms of terms of future m a activity i will repeat what i ve been pretty consistent in terms of what our strategy is on that front which is we in terms of what we like we have been very focused first of all i don t think there is a utility in the country that wouldn t benefit from the application of our playbook that said we have been focused on opportunities in the southeast in the midwest as well as ferc regulated opportunities those are the from a regulatory standpoint and other opportunities what we think are the best fit for us and that remains our focus and we continue to be very interested in trying to do something that said m a is always hard and there are a lot of hurdles to get over and we will as always be extraordinarily financially disciplined you will never see us announce a deal that we say is strategic and has no accretion so anything that we do will have significant accretion associated with it so i think it s probably the sum total what i could say on that steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay one quick technical question just is there a quick and easy way you can quantify the balance sheet capacity available for these ffo to debt and metrics at moody s and s p in terms of dollars rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah we re probably not going to quantify it exactly steve as you ve heard us say quite a number of times over the years a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us we clearly have some room from our downgrade threshold which is certainly terrific and it s important to us as we think about how do we make sure that we re prepared for making investments that we want to make in the future including especially this year setting aside the comments that just jim just made on m a just for our organic growth prospects alone we have 14 billion of planned capital investment in our business and having a strong balance sheet as we start to make those investments is incredibly important steve fleishman wolfe research analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america please go with your question julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hey good morning can you hear me rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer good morning we can hear you just fine julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent so thanks again for all the commentary so perhaps kicking it off on the repowering front would just be curious on your thoughts on the 24 opportunity now given the ptc extension how does that shift your thinking and logic around incremental repower and i know you provided already some fairly detailed remarks on repowering already but i want to dig in on that specific opportunity especially given that that s a year already after the timeline for the solar itc here if you can elaborate rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer sure of course as we highlighted in our development expectations that we laid out this summer for the 2019 through 2022 time frame you ll note that the repowering opportunities that we saw were heavily and at that time exclusively in the 2019 to 2020 time frame we ve continued to work on opportunities to repower our assets at both in 80 ptc and a 60 ptc so first we ll focus on the 80 before we even think about the extensions of the if anything that s possible in 60 but remember there s always a trade off in making these investment opportunities part of the economic value of that is getting the new set of ptcs and so there is a balance of the cost of the investment that you need to make in that equipment and also ensuring that you can meet the irs test of the 80 20 valuation and as the ptc value goes down it gets a little bit harder to justify those in both of those requirements so again we thought it was a terrific program to create a huge amount of shareholder value really highlights the option value embedded in our portfolio and we ll continue to be creative and work toward creating more opportunities like that where things that are analogous to it in the future julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it excellent and just clarifying the last question a little bit you mentioned ferc regulated opportunities jim can you elaborate a little bit further on thought process there obviously this transmission roe question has been kind of lingering across the sectors just want to make sure we heard you right just how you re thinking about various ferc asset classes james l robo chairman and chief executive officer yeah so obviously we did the trans bay acquisition that s not in the midwest or the southeast and we do on a long term basis like ferc regulated assets notwithstanding the recent roe decision on the miso transmission owners listen i think there has been obviously that s an open docket at ferc right now i probably can t comment on what i think the outcomes are going to be there but other than to say i do believe ferc regulation will be constructive in the long term and we think in the long term it s a good place for us to deploy capital julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst and maybe jim if i can one more quickly on esg as you think about establishing targets and becoming a perhaps more prescriptive and being a leader on this front how do you think about being more specific on carbon i know this come up a little bit but i m curious on thought process there i know it s also a complicated too james l robo chairman and chief executive officer sure you know i think we have been i think pretty specific about what our 2025 goal is which is remember there all of these discussions are about percent reductions we started at an enormously lower level than the rest of the industry on just base co2 emissions per megawatt hour generated right and so any of the goals that we lay out which our goal is a 67 reduction off our 2005 base by 2025 i think if you went back and you looked at the 2005 average u s average that and compare to our nextera rate in 2025 to that 2005 average i m going to give you a number and everyone is going to go check me on it it s going to be that would be an 85 or 90 reduction relative to the 2005 u s average co2 emissions rate so we have a we re going to significantly decarbonize our company and our emissions and i m really excited about the goals we set i think they re very doable and what i m most excited about is the role that we can play both in florida and in the rest of the country in terms of leading the way to decarbonize not just the electric not just the electric sector but the transportation sector so we have there s lots more to do as i said in my prepared remarks i think the country has a lot more to do and the great news for the country and the economy is you can be clean and low cost at the same time and whatever we do will be for the benefit of customers and it would drive it will drive good economics better gdp growth for the country lower costs and obviously a better environmental profile julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thank you guys for the time i appreciate it operator our next question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim partners please go ahead with your question shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey good morning guys james l robo chairman and chief executive officer good morning shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst good morning so just on near backlog it s obviously very strong again so i m just trying to get a sense rebecca on sort of how much of that backlog increase mainly on the wind side was attributed to a pull forward of projects with the modest ptc extension versus a versus like actual incremental opportunities you re seeing as we think about modeling forward rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i don t think it s very much i think it s early obviously the ptc extension happened very very late in 2019 so i don t think we ve seen any impacts from it whatsoever coupled with the fact that it s quite a number of years down the road and it doesn t affect the profile of the ptc in the next three years which is really what was driving a lot of our customers actions in terms of the overall demand and how that s reflected as we ve said in the past we saw 2020 was going to be a significant development year clearly it is for wind and that 2021 is more likely than not to be roughly comparable with where we were in 2019 and we continue to see really strong interest from our customers about wind in the long term as they should be as jim highlighted the cost of wind and solar projects out in the mid 2020s assuming there are not any meaningful extensions of the incentives which is an assumption at this point that should be checked but assuming those incentives are not extended a very competitive versus existing coal nuclear plants and some less efficient gas fired plants so economic should continue to drive decisions for our customers for many many years to come shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it and then just lastly thanks for the incremental disclosures around gulf is there anything you can like maybe provide directionally on sort of the base assumptions you re assuming in 22 as we re thinking about your eps guidance i e may be from a regulatory construct or even addition to spending opportunities like the extension of sobra is there anything you can provide directionally on how you re thinking about this rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer not much beyond what we ve already talked about in terms of everything that s built into our expectations for 2020 through 2022 and as you recall from the investor conference materials we did lay out a lot of the detail for both businesses through 2021 and of course more detail for energy resources out in 22 but the fundamentals are very consistent with what we ve been doing for a long time on the regulated businesses again focusing on good capital investment that adds value for our customers and taking cost out of the business to ensure that we have very thoughtful views on customer bills and in the case of gulf power targeting a meaningful decline in the bills out to the mid 2020s so keep doing what we re doing and we couldn t be more excited about the growth opportunities for all of the businesses that lay out in front of us shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it so stay tuned around the cap structure and the reserve amortization now you re thinking about chewing up between the two utilities rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer absolutely shahriar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst okay great congrats guys rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit suisse please go ahead with your question maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst hi this is maheep here on behalf of mike thanks for taking the questions just touching on the battery growth you re talking about can you talk about these reductions you re seeing on the battery systems for the projects in the pipe and would it be possible to quantify the scale of opportunity for retrofits on existing sites either at near or at nep rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer in terms of battery costs we ve laid out some of our thoughts and expectations i think most recently in our eei investor presentation we haven t broken that out between broken out a lot of the detail between battery pack and rest of the balance of system costs but everything that we ve laid out in terms of where we ve seen the market declines coming from in aggregate has really started to materialize and whereas two years ago we were surprised at how much faster costs were coming down we ve gotten more aggressive with our assumptions and now they re roughly consistent with what we were thinking we continue to be very optimistic longer term about batteries and is the whole industry has talked about it s really not about the power sector it s being driven much more by the electric vehicle sector and those drivers appear to be pretty clear for quite a number of years down the road which is really driving the manufacturing efficiencies and scale that we re seeing on the battery pack side so really excited and optimistic about where that business is headed maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst got it and could you just touch upon the retrofit opportunity for either neer or nep for batteries and would it be possible to get the tax credits on adding storage to an existing solar project rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes it could obviously be a significant opportunity coincident with the significant deployment of renewables particularly where the penetration is high adding batteries to existing solar sites could be very advantageous to the extent that they ve elected the itc and ultimately our charge are being used to charge the battery system yes they would qualify for itcs as long as we meet certain conditions so it s a terrific opportunity for the team but it s really consistent with what we ve been thinking about for the overall market opportunity and what we ve been highlighting for quite some time now to investors maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst got it and just one last question from me if you could talk about the impact on interest rates on nep s ability to execute the convertible refinancings thank you rebecca j kujawa executive vice president finance and chief financial officer it s been terrific low interest rate environment is obviously terrific for both of our businesses we love low cost of capital to be able to deploy these solutions as economically as possible for both our customers on the energy resources side as well as our regulated utilities and of course also for nextera energy partners so it s been terrific maheep mandloi credit suisse analyst thanks operator duration 65 minutes

yen on concerns that the coronavirus would spread euro fell across the board on dovish comments from european central bank president christine lagarde versus the japanese yen dollar met renewed selling at 109 86 in australia and dropped to 109 59 in asian morning on dampened risk appetite on concerns that the coronavirus in china may be spreading together with a selloff in nikkei 225 then

the single currency dropped from 1 1099 to 1 1081 at asian open on dampened risk appetite then marginally lower to 1 1080 in european morning later euro briefly rose to session highs at 1 1108 at new york open after ecb kept its rates unchanged before tumbling to a 7 week low at 1 1037 in new york due partly to dovish comments from ecb president christine lagarde and then rebounded to 1 1057 near the close on short covering reuters reported the european central bank left its policy unchanged on thursday and launched a strategic review of its inflation goal and tools the governing council decided to launch a review of the ecb s monetary policy strategy further details about the scope and timetable of the review will be published in a press release today at 15 30 cet the ecb said it reaffirmed its pledge to keep rates at rock bottom or even cut them while also buying bonds at 20 billion euros per month until inflation in the euro zone headed back to its target of just under 2 the governing council expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics the ecb said reuters reported the european central bank launched a broad review of its policy on thursday that is likely to see new president christine lagarde redefine the ecb s main goal and how to achieve it the euro zone s central bank has fallen short of its inflation target of just under 2 for years even after launching increasingly aggressive stimulus measures under lagarde s predecessor mario draghi lagarde said that aim will now be reviewed along with the ecb s toolkit how it measures price growth and how it communicates with the public we will not leave any stone unturned and how we measure inflation is clearly something we need to look at lagarde told her second news conference as ecb president how the ecb changes its formulation of price stability currently defined as an annual inflation rate below but close to 2 over the medium term will be crucial to anticipate future policy moves the ecb could signal its commitment to boosting inflation by raising the goal to 2 and spelling out that it will take any undershooting just as seriously as an overshoot

s government cannot sustain federal deficits growing at current levels and will have to slow the rate of government spending as he acknowledged the administration of president donald trump was considering additional tax cuts to stimulate the economy mnuchin blamed government spending for the federal deficit there s no question we need to slow down the rate of growth of government spending because we can t sustain these deficits growing at these levels he said in an interview with cnbc from the world economic forum in davos switzerland on the data front reuters reported the number of americans filing for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week suggesting the labor market continues to tighten even as job growth is slowing initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6 000 to a seasonally adjusted 211 000 for the week ended jan 18 the labor department said on thursday claims had declined for five straight weeks resulting in the unwinding of the surge

at the world economic forum in davos switzerland last week president trump again talked positively about negative interest rates that s not a very good idea at all since negative interest rates are a warning signal of deflation which can be as bad for an economy as runaway inflation but trump was right to herald this era of low nominal interest rates and inflation if you want to understand how the dow jones industrial average has risen from a low of 800 to a high of 29 000 in four decades look at the accompanying graph showing the sharp and relentless decline in interest rates between 1980 and 2020 think about how the world has changed this time 40 years ago 10 year treasury bills paid an interest rate of 16 now they are at 2 it may be the biggest unsung story of the economic success story a gift that just keeps on giving i remember in the early 1980s my local bank was trying to lure depositors by offering lifetime cds paying 10 to 12 interest rates many of the banks that made such foolish offerings failed in the years to come what happened federal reserve chairman paul volcker teamed together with ronald reagan in a political partnership that slew inflation bringing it down from 12 to 4 in about 18 months the high nominal interest rates back then were simply the price we all paid for runaway inflation which rose to 12 in 1980 the consensus among economists and leading financiers was that double digit inflation was with us for decades to come as then dean of economics paul samuelson warned about in his weekly newsweek column whoops what was not foreseen was that reagan and volcker would start a new economic regime to kill inflation that prevails to this day we now live in an era with interest rates lower than at any time in decades and the forecast is for borrowing costs which are driven primarily by inflation and inflationary expectations to remain microscopic for years and decades to come why do these low rates matter to the economy let s start by imagining the added cost to buying or selling a home today if we still had mortgage rates as high as they were back then homeowners would be paying thousands of dollars of extra mortgage payments a year and real estate values would crash as would homebuilding second low interest rates raise stock values and wealth inflation and high interest rates are the thieves of the stock market the towering inflation of the late 1960s through 1980 corresponded with a near 60 collapse in the after inflation return on stocks it was one of the greatest liquidations of wealth in u s history a blood bath disinflation and falling interest rates combined with a stable dollar have helped resurrect growth while u s assets owned by the public have reached 100 trillion in value third low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing costs for businesses and allow small firms that might not have access to equity markets to expand investment through loans by the way real inflation adjusted interest rates rise when there is a higher demand for credit as happened in the 1980s even as nominal rates plummeted the biggest winner of all from low rates is of course uncle sam every 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates reduces federal borrowing costs by at least 1 trillion over a decade a sudden spike in rates by say 200 basis points which would still be below the historical average in the post world war ii era means 2 trillion to 3 trillion of higher interest expenditures on top of 20 trillion of publicly traded debt a final point i keep hearing senior citizens and financial advisers complain that low interest rates hurt retirees on fixed incomes that s nonsense seniors tend to hold more stocks than young people so the surge in stock values has disproportionately benefited older people in the united states seniors who complain about today s low returns on bonds should be taking a look at how their stock portfolios are performing in just three years under trump index funds have seen better than a 50 return some 60 trillion of wealth is held by seniors today and will soon be passed on to the younger generations thanks to this 40 year surge in the stock market in the 1970s seniors living on fixed incomes were supposed victims of high inflation and interest rates because it cost them more to buy food medicine and energy higher interest rates would correspond with a higher cost of living so seniors should be careful of what they wish for so should trump his administration is benefiting mightily from low rates and tame inflation which his supply side policies including tax cuts have contributed but negative rates would mean falling prices and the last time that happened the nation found itself heading into the great depression stephen moore is the washington examiner s finance and economics columnist and an economic consultant with freedomworks he also is co author of trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive our economy
politics government delaney at nhti the future is about skills not degrees presidential candidate former congressman and entrepreneur says america needs expanded trade stronger safety net and worker rights concord nh one of the first prominent democrats to announce a run for president in 2020 continues to zigzag between iowa and new hampshire to talk about his race for the white house and the need for moderate change while struggling to gain a foothold against an ever increasing tide of frontrunners shifting the party lefty john delaney a former maryland representative to congress and business creator attended a forum friday on the health of the american economy co sponsored by the community college system of new hampshire the new hampshire union leader and goldman sachs 10 000 small businesses at nhti concord s community college at the talk he called for a forward looking strategy that will build an economy of the future delaney criticized president donald trump for taking credit for an economy that was better than it was in the past but that was too concentrated eighty percent of the venture capital he said was invested in a handful of counties it was great that so many entrepreneurs were creating jobs delaney said but the rest of the country was getting squeezed by the limited areas where the economy was booming the real problem with the jobs market right now is not jobs but pay he said there are actually a fair number of jobs but most of them don t pay enough the statistics don t tell the story most americans are struggling they haven t seen the benefits of economic growth while seeing more friction in their lives with health care housing and other issues as one of the youngest ceos to ever have a company on the stock exchange delaney said he was equipped to not only take on the president but also create better opportunities for everyone in the country that needed help instead of relying on propping up rural economies with coal which was harming the climate delaney said the president was correct to beat the drums against china but tackled the problem in the wrong way the focus shouldn t just be on the trade deficit with china although that was important the bigger issues was intellectual property and outright theft china has acted like pirates he said they steal everything delaney said the trans pacific partnership agreement would have fixed some of those problems and could have led to a new better global trade agreement with china which would have allowed all nations of the world to join together to force the country to stop stealing unfortunately he said tpp was killed delaney still supports it and was surprised there were so many democrats balking at what was supposed to be a highlight and success of president barack obama s second term while in congress delaney founded the artificial intelligence caucus so members could learn more about the future of work and what was coming with the economy while finding ways to create a domestic economic strategy that would dominant innovation in the sector whoever controls that part of the economy will rule it for the next 20 years he said the united states and china were in the best position to control the sector but ai innovation he said could only really occur in a liberal democracy that obeys the rule of law has free speech and allows its people to have rights which means it was up to the united states to dominate the marketplace china s advantage the citizens have no privacy citizens are a giant lab he said but the federal government could not allow china to steal its way to an equal footing with america delaney said at the same time the nation needed to prepare to embrace the technology there has been this myth for 100 years plus longer ever since the luddite movement that innovation takes away jobs delaney said that s ridiculous innovation always creates more jobs workers he said needed to benefit from the economic expansion and also be protected too with better negotiating rights technology he admitted allowed companies to access labor on the margins another part of expanding economic opportunity was to improve education instead of looking at education from the perspective of kindergarten through 12th grade delaney said it should be pre k to 14 meaning pre kindergarten through high school and then two year community college and trade schools with the federal government subsidizing schools with grants to close the gap with states matching the grants delaney called pre k the best investment we can make by far not unlike early childhood education because it changes the trajectory of the students to me the future is about skills not degrees he said and we have to stop thinking degrees i have nothing against to degrees but we really have to lead with skills and community colleges are the singular asset we have in this nation to ensure that we have skill building programs for all of our kids many students today he said were coming out of high school completely unprepared for the future work and society the military he noted was rejecting about 70 percent of its new high school graduate recruits due to education health and social reasons to pay for the expanded education programs delaney would raise the capital gains tax rate to what earned income tax rates were he called it preposterous that the rates weren t the same even president ronald reagan the last president to have the same rates thought they should be the same noting people who invest for a living should pay the same rate as people who work for a living delaney said the dual rates still baffles me that we ve bought this for decades the fight with democrats right now he said was a stupid debate about capitalism vs socialism the united states he said was a free market economy driven by businesses and entrepreneurs that should be allowed to work its magic while moderating it with great societal infrastructure like public education infrastructure a strong safety net and workers rights those things kind of working together have been the genius of our country delaney said free markets though can be disruptive which is why delaney said opportunity zone legislation doubling the earned income tax credit requiring federal contracts to private employers have 25 percent of those contracts in struggling communities while also stabilizing rural communities on health care delaney called for the government to negotiate prescription drug prices on a global scale ensuring a fair profit for companies and while the world s most destitute citizens gain access to drugs they need he supported universal care not by creating a single payer plan but a federal plan to allow every citizen to have coverage from birth to 65 while eliminating and rolling in medicaid to that program and letting medicare take care of retirees single payer he said wasn t really a good idea because it offered the bare minimum to some people while those who were affluent could receive better care by paying for it out of pocket his plan would cost about 5 trillion and he would pay for it by eliminating the corporate deduction for health care eliminating the affordable care act subsidies and matching grants from states we have a universal care now he quipped it s called an emergency room the dumbest form of universal health care that we could create a shaker road school student asked about increasing refugees to pre trump levels and he agreed with the proposal delaney called it a humane policy but it also needed to be coupled with a global effort to reduce the need for people filing for asylum the root cause of asylum needed to be solved to curb future migration while also making sure the borders were secure he said climate change and pandemics were only going to make the problem worse which is why the united states needed to be proactive about its asylum policy while still having it reflect the nation s values delaney said on the federal debt delaney said he would like to get the debt down by stabilizing economic growth to at least 2 percent and lowering the amount of money being borrowed to 60 to 70 percent of the economy versus 100 percent of the economy which is close to where it is now he said two other issues needed to be solved fixing health care it s a doomsday machine and curing diseases too like cancer and alzheimer s as well as raising more tax revenue slowing health care costs to the inflation rate would also need to be done to make social security solvent for the next 75 years he would raise the cap to a higher level but he wouldn t eliminate the cap entirely delaney also agreed wealthier americans should pay higher taxes along with making the capital gains tax rates even with earned income tax rates he would roll back the 2017 tax reform act and raise the corporate tax rate to 27 or 28 percent follow the new hampshire patch politics twitter account nhpatchpolitics for all our campaign

when the price of apple stock hit a then record high in october 2018 among the shareholders counting their gains were 43 republicans in congress who collectively owned as much as 1 5 million worth of the tech giant s shares apple s stock jumped 37 percent in its runup to that record several variables were behind the climb including higher than expected earnings but congressional republicans themselves had a hand in the spike stock analysts say legislation they championed the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act doled out nearly 150 billion in corporate tax savings in 2018 alone one effect a big boost in stock prices cutting tax rates for companies like apple and hundreds of other stocks they own was one of many ways republican lawmakers enriched themselves after they passed the tax law according to a center for public integrity analysis of the 186 page law and members financial disclosure forms democrats also stood to gain from the tax bill though not one voted for it all but 12 republicans voted for the tax bill as part of the bill republicans approved tax breaks in 2017 for seven classes of assets many of the wealthier members of congress held at the time including partnerships small corporations real estate and several esoteric investment vehicles while they sold the bill as a package of business and middle class tax cuts that would not help the wealthy the cuts likely saved members of congress hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes collectively while the corporate tax cut hiked the value of their holdings it feels to me like a kleptocracy said jeff hauser director of the revolving door project at the center for economic and policy research a left leaning think tank in washington dc such congressional self enrichment has been thrust into the 2020 presidential campaign democratic candidate sen elizabeth warren has said her first priority as president would be to pass an anti corruption package that among other things would forbid members of congress from owning individual stocks bonds and other securities so they could not benefit from tax or financial laws they passed under current law members of congress can trade stocks and then use their powerful positions to increase the value of those stocks and pad their own pockets warren wrote in a september medium post republicans own lots of stock two years after the passage of the trump tax act its effects some obvious some hidden are coming into focus one is its cost contrary to republican claims the law is not paying for itself and is likely to burden the nation with an additional 1 9 trillion in debt over 11 years beginning in 2018 according to the congressional budget office and while the law cut tax rates for people of all income brackets some of its tax benefits overtly favored the wealthy such as the 2 6 percentage point tax rate cut in the highest bracket and the doubling of the estate tax exemption to 11 2 million other provisions were subtler yet favored the wealthy even more tax breaks for their investments for instance or changes that boosted the value of their stocks among the rich beneficiaries are members of congress more than half of whom were found to be millionaires in 2014 the tax law s centerpiece is its record cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent at the time of its passage most of the bill s republican supporters said the cut would result in higher wages factory expansions and more jobs instead it was mainly exploited by corporations which bought back stock and raised dividends in 2018 stock buybacks exceeded 1 trillion for the first time ever according to trimtabs an investment research firm net corporate dividends reached a new high in 2018 of more than 1 3 trillion nearly 6 percent more than the previous year the result analysts say the buybacks boosted stock prices and bigger dividends put even more money in the pockets of stockholders promises that the tax act would boost investment have not panned out corporate investment is now at lower levels than before the act passed according to the commerce department though employment and wages have increased it is hard to separate the effect of the tax act from general economic improvements since the 2008 recession the boost in stock prices however was predictable as the bill was reaching its final stages in 2017 bryan rich the ceo of logic fund management a wealth advisory company wrote that the proposed corporate rate cut will go right to the bottom line of companies popping eps and driving stocks even higher those benefits mainly went to the rich as the wealthiest 10 percent of americans own 84 percent of all stocks the 10 richest republicans in congress in 2017 who voted for the tax bill held more than 731 million in assets almost two thirds of which were in stocks bonds mutual funds and other instruments according to roll call s semiannual assessment of congress s wealth the precise amount of republicans windfall can t be determined without a review of the members tax returns which they are not required to disclose all but one of the 47 republicans who sat on the three key committees overseeing the drafting of the tax bill own stocks and stock mutual funds according to public integrity s analysis rep mike kelly r pa was among them a member of the ways and means committee which oversaw the writing of the tax bill in the house kelly reported in 2018 that his spouse owned 101 individual stocks apple included with a minimum total value of 439 000 when he voted for the 2017 tax cuts which will be funded by nearly 2 trillion in added debt kelly called it the most important vote i ve ever cast yet 19 months later he voted against a two year budget agreement that added to the national debt by hiking government spending for defense and nondefense programs by 320 billion kelly warned that america is driving toward a fiscal cliff orrin hatch r ut was chair of the senate finance committee in 2017 when he and his wife owned mutual funds and a limited liability corporation valued between 562 000 and 1 430 million paying them between 12 700 and 38 500 in dividends and capital gains according to hatch s financial disclosure forms they also owned a blind trust worth between 1 million and 5 million congressional financial disclosure forms do not require members to report the precise value of assets and income but rather in 11 different ranges each with a minimum and a maximum value for decades hatch who retired in 2018 had been one of the loudest deficit hawks in congress just 10 months before he would shepherd the tax bill through his committee hatch said the national debt crisis poses a significant and growing threat to the economic and national security of this country his concern over national security lasted two months in april hatch signaled he was open to a republican tax bill that would likely add to the national debt when republicans passed the tax bill in december 2017 he beamed this is a historic night he said at a press conference the center for public integrity sought comment from 13 current or former members of congress mentioned in this article only two responded a big bump from overseas onshoring republican lawmakers also boosted the value of their stock holdings when they encouraged american corporations to repatriate money they were holding overseas the tax law decreed that future foreign profits would not be taxed at high rates and that previously earned profits stashed abroad an estimated 2 7 trillion would be taxed one time at no more than 15 5 percent in 2017 apple was sitting on 250 billion in overseas profits in january 2018 the month after president donald trump signed the tax bill into law the tech behemoth and third largest american company said it would pay the new lower tax and start bringing the cash home just four months later apple said it would buy back 100 billion of its stock and hike its dividend by 16 percent apple shares increased almost 9 percent by the week s end in april 2019 apple announced 75 billion more in buybacks a move analysts said would likely drive its stock price higher a day after the announcement shares increased in value nearly 5 percent the stock continued to hit record highs late last year that increase and higher dividends augmented the holdings of 43 republicans who voted for the tax bill including seven senators and their spouses who owned apple stock in 2018 john hoeven of north dakota david perdue of georgia arizona s jeff flake now retired jim inhofe of oklahoma and the spouses of pat roberts of kansas maine s susan collins and shelley capito of west virginia a spokesperson for hoeven said that he follows senate regulations and reporting requirements sen collins s husband s portfolio decisions are all made by a financial adviser a collins spokesperson said and he has not bought or sold apple stock since 2015 perdue is one of the wealthiest senators with a net worth of 15 8 million 14 million of which is in stocks according to roll call in 2018 with his wife perdue owned 100 000 to 250 000 in apple stock he reported the couple sold some of it and received annual dividends and capital gains that year between 15 000 and 50 000 the optics that the tax cuts would boost the prices of stock he owned apparently didn t concern perdue weeks before republicans passed the tax bill fox news host maria bartiromo asked perdue if he was worried that the corporate cuts would result in buybacks and increased dividends instead of new jobs well maria he answered i come from the school that you know all of the above is acceptable this is capitalism he later added that it was all about capital flow whether for jobs economic growth or dividends an affinity for small business and pass throughs passing a law that helped fuel increases in stock prices wasn t the only way republicans enriched themselves the new law also contained a 20 percent deduction for income from so called pass through businesses a provision called the crown jewel of the act by the national federation of independent businesses a lobbying group pass throughs are single owner businesses partnerships limited liability companies known as llcs and special corporations called s corps most real estate companies are organized as llcs trump owns hundreds of them and the center for public integrity s analysis found that 22 of the 47 members of the house and senate tax writing committees in 2017 were invested in them pass throughs can be found in any industry they pay no corporate taxes and steer their profits as income to business owners or investors who are taxed only once at their individual rates despite their favored treatment as a business vehicle the 2017 tax act did them another favor it allowed 20 percent to be deducted off the top of the pass through income for tax purposes in the senate the champion for the pass through break was ron johnson a wisconsin republican who was a budget committee member when the tax bill was being written he argued that because the bill was slated to give big corporations a 14 percent cut in their tax rate smaller businesses should get a break too i just have in my heart a real affinity for these owner operated pass throughs he told the new york times when the senate was considering the tax bill in november 2017 no doubt johnson with his wife held interests that year in four real estate or manufacturing llcs worth between 6 2 million and 30 5 million from which they received income that year between 250 000 and 2 1 million according to his financial disclosure form how much money lawmakers will pocket from the 20 percent pass through deduction can t be determined without an examination of their tax returns there are limits on how much of the deduction can be taken based on total income and business category but in some cases the tax savings could run into the tens of thousands of dollars johnson declined to comment for this article and while the provision did help small businesses in certain favored categories the benefits of the pass through deduction are heavily tilted toward the wealthy sixty one percent of the benefits of this provision will go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers in 2024 according to the joint committee on taxation the congressional agency that analyzes tax bills gop real estate owners make out big besides the law s benefits to real estate pass throughs real estate in general was hugely favored by the tax law allowing property exchanges to avoid taxation the deduction of new capital expenses in just one year versus longer depreciation schedules and an exemption from limits on interest deductions if you are a real estate developer you never pay tax said ed kleinbard a former head of congress s joint committee on taxation members of congress own a lot of real estate public integrity s review of financial disclosures found that 29 of the 47 gop members of the committees responsible for the tax bill hold interests in real estate including small rental businesses llcs and massive real estate investment trusts reits which pay dividends to investors the tax bill allows reit investors to deduct 20 percent from their dividends for tax purposes real estate pass throughs got an especially sweet gift in the form of a provision inserted into the tax bill behind the closed doors of the house senate conference committee the senate bill under consideration based a company s pass through deductions on the total amount of wages paid to employees because real estate pass through companies typically have few employees however this meant they could offer only tiny deductions to investors a stroke of the pen fixed that someone changed the law to allow real estate companies to use the value of their assets in addition to the size of their payrolls to calculate pass through benefits because such companies can hold sizable assets suddenly they too could offer the full 20 percent deduction to investors in my judgment it was a big giveaway to the real estate community and they are very good lobbyists said steve rosenthal a senior fellow at the nonpartisan urban brookings tax policy center in washington dc that giveaway contributed to last year s record 1 02 trillion federal revenue shortfall one republican senator who benefited from the last minute provision was tennessee s bob corker who at the time owned or was a partner in 18 real estate businesses llcs and partnerships records show his reported income from them was between 2 1 million and 11 1 million in 2017 corker who retired in 2018 told public integrity he had nothing to do with the provision or the 20 percent pass through deduction it was all ron johnson s idea corker said the budget deficit is going up so that people like ron johnson and bob corker can pay less in taxes said hauser of the revolving door project forbidding self dealing would help close the loopholes republicans wouldn t have had many of these apparent conflicts if elizabeth warren s anti corruption plan had been in effect much of the plan was pulled from her anti corruption and public integrity act which she introduced in the senate in 2018 among its provisions the bill would forbid lawmakers to own or trade individual stocks bonds commodities hedge funds derivatives or complex investment vehicles members would be required to put their assets in widely held investment vehicles such as mutual funds warren and her husband were invested in 20 mutual funds in 2017 but no individual stocks members could no longer own commercial real estate though they could keep businesses with revenue under 5 million which could include a lot of pass throughs warren s bill hasn t moved out of the senate finance committee an identical bill in the house also remains idle warren s plan faces an uphill climb even among democrats it s very difficult to get congresspeople to pass rules that make life exceedingly difficult for themselves said beth rotman the money in politics and ethics director at common cause a government watchdog in washington dc but it s happened in the past in 1978 congress passed the ethics in government act in the wake of the watergate scandal it requires certain government officials including members of congress to file annual financial forms records the center for public integrity used for this analysis and in 2012 congress passed a bill that made it unlawful to use insider information to trade stocks required members to report stock trades within 45 days of the transaction and required lawmakers to file disclosure forms online in a searchable sortable and downloadable database so conflicts of interest would be easy to detect within a year congress had removed the searchable and sortable language from the law the financial disclosures are now available online but they are not easily searched or sorted apparently just because of disclosure stock trading by senators dropped by about two thirds in the three years following the law s enactment according to a study by craig holman at the government watchdog group public citizen but holman said he found that some senators continued to trade in stocks in the very businesses they oversaw in their committees a practice public citizen wants banned ironically it was congress that passed laws that restrict other federal government officials from owning stocks or assets that would benefit from the officials decisions or require them to recuse themselves from such decisions yet congress has not passed legislation that bans itself from the same practice congress should have the same rules put on them that the executive branch has said rotman of common cause the executive branch conflict of interest rules are stronger for the 2017 tax act holman of public citizen notes that about six years ago researchers found that more than half of the members of congress were millionaires they are passing tax laws and legislation that disproportionately favors the wealthy class holman said and that means they personally benefit from this type of legislation and from what we ve seen especially from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 he added that tax bill clearly favored the very wealthy over the rest of americans and that means it favored congress over the rest of america peter cary is a consulting reporter for the center for public integrity a nonprofit investigative news organization in washington dc

financial measure with that i will turn the call over to jim james robo thank you matt and good morning everyone 2019 was a terrific year for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners nextera energyâ s performance was strong both financially and operationally and we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company by successfully executing on our plans nextera energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of 8 37 up 8 7 from 2018 over the past 15 years weâ ve now delivered compound annual growth and adjusted eps of nearly 8 5 which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 4 over the same period amidst this significant growth the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry in 2019 we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43 significantly outperforming both the s p 500 and the s p 500 utilities index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one three five seven and 10 year basis over the past 15 years we have outperformed all of the other companies in the s p utilities index and 85 of the companies in the s p 500 while more than tripling the total shareholder return of both indices although we are proud of our long term track record of creating shareholder value we remain utterly focused on the future and committed to continuing that track record going forward during 2019 fpl successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan including placing the highly efficient okeechobee clean energy center and an additional 300 megawatts of cost effective solar in service on time and on budget smart capital investments such as these help fpl improve its already best in class customer value proposition despite customer bills that were already nearly 30 below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of florida earlier this month the typical fpl residential customer bill decreased by nearly 4 or roughly 4 fpl had continued success with its cost savings initiatives reducing its already best in class dollar per retail megawatt hour non fuel o m costs by more than 5 year over year these ongoing cost savings combined with the flexibility afforded by fplâ s current settlement agreement enabled fpl to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly 260 million of storm restoration costs related to hurricane dorian in addition to low bills fpl delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation finally last quarter we were pleased that following an extensive and thorough 18 month review the nuclear regulatory commission granted turkey point units 3 and 4 their second 20 year license extensions these units are the first nuclear power plants in the united states to achieve this milestone and this decision supports the continued production of clean zero emission reliable and affordable nuclear power in florida for many years to come beyond executing on its strategic initiatives during 2019 fpl positioned itself well for continued long term growth early in the year fpl announced its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan which is one of the worldâ s largest solar expansions and will result in roughly 10 000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on fplâ s system this solar expansion combined with low cost battery storage solutions such as the manatee energy storage center that was announced during 2019 represent the next phase of fplâ s generation modernization efforts and are expected to further reduce fplâ s co2 emissions rates which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30 since 2005 in addition to the terrific progress in generation during the year florida passed the public utility storm protection plans law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments including undergrounding this new law supports continued hardening of fplâ s already storm resilient energy grid and allows fpl to pursue these investments in a programmatic manner over the course of decades while deploying billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers we expect the final rules related to the new law to take effect later this quarter and that fpl will seek to begin clause recovery of its storm hardening investments beginning in 2021 with terrific visibility into significant investment programs such as these we remain as confident as ever about fplâ s ability to sustain its long term growth trajectory while further improving our customersâ value proposition the energy resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2019 the renewables origination success remained particularly strong with the team adding more than 5 800 megawatts to our backlog over the past year as we continue operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history our ongoing renewables origination success results from our ability to leverage energy resourcesâ competitive advantages including our best in class development skills large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions strong customer relationships purchasing power best in class construction expertise resource assessment capabilities strong access to and cost of capital advantages and world class operations capability more than 50 of the solar megawatts that were added to our backlog in 2019 included a battery storage component and the current backlog has more than 2 000 megawatts of trifecta projects that combined wind solar and battery storage together we also increasingly see storage as an important standalone business in its own right as we were reviewing a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the itc and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers this highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution as well as energy resourcesâ unique skills to combine the three technologies into integrated near firm low cost products energy resourcesâ significant competitive advantages position it well to capitalize on the enormous disruption that is occurring to the nationâ s generation fleet we continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives new near firm wind is going to be a 20 to 30 per megawatt hour product and new near firm solar is going to be a 30 to 40 per megawatt hour product at these prices new near firm renewables will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal nuclear and less efficient oil and gas fired generation units we were pleased by the 60 ptc extension that was passed in 2019 and we expect that it will support incremental wind demand in 2023 and 2024 our confidence in renewables being the low cost generation alternative in the middle of this decade remains stronger than ever we expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade let me now turn to gulf power and highlight how we executed in 2019 against some of the long term objectives that we outlined last year as weâ ve often discussed two of the key hallmarks of the nextera energy playbook are reduced operating costs and using those savings to fund smart capital investments for our customers after one year of ownership we are well on our way to executing this strategy at gulf power in 2019 we reduced gulf powerâ s o m costs by approximately 20 year over year in addition to lowering costs weâ ve also identified smart investment opportunities to benefit customers in 2019 gulf power invested approximately 730 million or roughly 2 5 times gulf powerâ s average capital investment amount over the past five years and was able to regulatory capital employed at roughly 11 year over year beyond realizing operating efficiencies and deploying smart capital in the past year gulf power was able to meaningfully improve its customer value proposition gulf power achieved its best ever service reliability year which was approximately 20 better than its 2018 results customer service was also better with notable improvements in speed of answer and florida public service commission complaints there is nothing more important in our company than the safety of our employees we made significant improvements in this area in 2019 as well with an approximately 40 reduction in our osha rate at gulf power versus 2018 as the major capital investments that we advanced during 2019 come into service in 2020 and beyond they will help achieve the other key objectives that we have outlined at gulf power such as meaningful emissions reductions and perhaps most importantly a significant reduction in customer bills in real terms in addition to creating tremendous customer value we expect that execution of the plans weâ ve laid out at gulf power will also generate great outcomes for our shareholders as well in our first year of ownership gulf powerâ s adjusted earnings increase by 25 year over year this outcome was even better than our plan at the start of the year and positions us well to deliver on the financial growth objectives that we outlined when we announced the acquisition this high level performance across the board would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all gulf power employees while we are pleased with the results that weâ ve achieved at gulf power during 2019 we remain focused on the significant execution ahead of us here to deliver even greater value to our customers and our shareholders finally we were once again honored to be named for the 13th time in 14 years number one in the electric and gas utilities industry on fortuneâ s list of most admired companies as well as ranked among the top ten companies worldwide across all industries for social responsibility during 2019 alone nextera energy made approximately 13 billion in capital investments in american energy infrastructure making us one of the top capital investors in the u s in any industry none of these recognitions nor our track record of success would be possible without the hard work and commitment to excellence of our people who live our core value of doing the right thing every day in the last year there has been an increasing focus on esg on the part of many of our stakeholders the fact is our company has been focused on all of the elements of esg for more than 25 years we are proud of our track record here but there is still so much more to do in this country to decarbonizes the electric transportation and industrial sectors nextera energy is living proof that you can be clean and low cost and financially successful all at the same time we will be at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector we expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful co2 emissions reductions across the country while simultaneously lowering generation costs for customers and our continued investments in clean energy will help advance nextera energy towards its goal of reducing its co2 emissions rate by 67 by 2025 from a 2005 baseline in summary i continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about nextera energyâ s long term growth prospects in 2019 we extended our long term track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best in class organic growth prospects based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses i will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020 2021 and 2022 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years let me now turn to nextera energy partners which also had a terrific year of execution in 2019 in the more than five years since the ipo nextera energy partners has consistently delivered on its commitments that history of execution is supported by nextera energy partnersâ outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets which grew significantly and was further diversified in 2019 during the year nextera energy partners acquired a portfolio of more than 600 megawatts of wind and solar assets from energy resources additionally during the fourth quarter nextera energy partners closed on the acquisition of meade pipeline company which owns an approximately 40 aggregate interest in central penn line an interstate natural gas pipeline in pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14 year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk finally during the year nextera energy partners advanced an additional organic growth opportunity announcing the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects we are proud that 2019 is the first year that nextera energy partners successfully executed on all of the three ways it can grow organically acquiring assets from third parties and acquiring assets from energy resourcesâ portfolio highlighting the clear flexibility and visibility into growth going forward to support the ongoing growth investments and optimize the capitals structure for the benefit of lp unit holders nextera energy partners completed a number of financings and refinancings in 2019 as well at the start of the year nextera energy partners faced headwinds related to the pg e bankruptcy the team immediately focused on managing and mitigating the negative impacts of this event and we ended 2019 having favorably addressed many of the challenges the energy resources portfolio acquisition and associated financing that we announced last march allowed nextera energy partners to complete its original 2019 growth objectives even after excluding pg e related project cash flows during the year nextera energy partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our genesis project in addition to resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution through the removal of project level debt service as a result of the purchase of the debt nextera energy partners received approximately 128 million of distributions that had been or were expected to be restricted at the project the release of this cash was used to partially fund the debt repurchase i remain confident about a long term favorable resolution for our pg e related assets in addition to growing lp distributions by 15 year over year and achieving a run rate adjusted ebitda range in excess of what was originally expected nextera energy partnersâ year end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations assuming full contributions from pg e related projects represents approximately 60 growth from the comparable year end 2018 run rate range with this strong year over year growth and cash available for distribution nextera energy partners expects to be able to achieve its long term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021 as of year end 2020 we expect to have achieved nextera energy partnersâ distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the mid 70s range even after excluding cash distributions from our desert sunlight projects nep delivered an attractive total unit holder return of approximately 28 in 2019 further advancing its history of value creation since the ipo i continue to believe that the combination of nepâ s clean energy portfolio growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offer lp unit holders an attractive investor value proposition as with nextera energy we remain focused on continuing to execute in delivering that unit holder value over the coming years iâ ll now turn the call over to rebecca who will review the 2019 results in more detail rebecca kujawa thank you jim and good morning everyone letâ s now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the fourth quarter of 2019 fpl reported net income of 400 million or 0 81 per share down 0 04 per share year over year for the full year 2019 fpl reported net income of 2 33 billion or 4 81 per share an increase of 0 26 per share versus 2018 regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8 3 for 2019 and was the principal driver of fplâ s net income growth of roughly 8 for the full year during the fourth quarter growth from new investments was offset by a number of factors including a contribution to our charitable foundation that should fund its operations for the next several years fplâ s capital expenditures were approximately 2 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly 5 8 billion fplâ s reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11 6 for the 12 months ending december 31 2019 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6 to 11 6 under our current rate agreement during the fourth quarter we utilized a total of 18 million of reserve amortization including the approximately 260 million that was utilized to offset hurricane dorian storm restoration costs leaving fpl with a year end 2019 balance of 893 million we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for one additional year and as a result expect to file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in january of 2022 while we have not made a final decision based on our review we expect that the merging of fpl and gulf power and making a single rate case filing will result in customer benefits and we therefore see this as a likely approach for the filing at this time all of our major capital projects at fpl are progressing well the 10 solar sites totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across fplâ s service territory are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to fpl customers in early 2020 to support the significant solar expansion that fpl is leading across florida we have secured sites that could support 10 gigawatts of future projects earlier this month the florida public service commission held hearings on fplâ s proposed solar together program we continue to expect a decision about the proposed program at the end of the first quarter beyond solar construction on a highly efficient roughly 1 200 megawatt dania beach clean energy centre remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022 we continue to expect that fplâ s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate of regulatory capital employed of approximately 9 from 2018 through 2022 while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition let me now turn to gulf power which reported fourth quarter 2019 gaap and adjusted earnings of 23 million and 26 million respectively or 0 05 per share for the full year gulf power reported gaap earnings of 180 million or 0 37 per share and adjusted earnings of 200 million or 0 41 per share as a reminder during the first 12 months following the closing of the acquisition we excluded one time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings additionally interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in corporate and other gulf powerâ s reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10 8 for the 12 months ending december 2019 which is in the upper half of the allowed band of 9 25 to 11 25 under its current rate agreement for the full year 2020 we expect to target a regulatory roe near the upper end of this allowed band assuming normal weather and operating conditions as jim discussed the overall execution of gulf powerâ s capital program is advancing well gulf powerâ s first solar development project the roughly 75 megawatt blue indigo solar energy center is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime all the other major capital investments including the north florida resiliency connection and the plant crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track the florida economy remains healthy as floridaâ s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation according to recent irs data florida attracted a net gain of roughly 16 billion in personal taxable income in 2018 by far the highest of any state in the country and the fastest rate of growth as well which is a reflection of the attraction of floridaâ s low tax pro business policies floridaâ s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3 1 below the national average and at the lowest level in a decade florida has now added nearly 2 million private sector jobs over the last 10 years leading indicators in the real estate sector have remained at a stable pace reflecting continued strength of the florida housing market other positive economic data across the state include continued strength in retail taxable sales as well as the consumer confidence index which remains near 10 year highs during the quarter fplâ s average number of customers increased by approximately 100 000 from the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of vero beachâ s roughly 35 000 customers late last year for 2019 fplâ s retail sales increased 1 7 from the prior year driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison on a weather normalized basis fplâ s retail sales declined by 0 6 as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer the decline in underlying usage was a reversal from the trend that fpl experienced in 2018 when underlying usage increased by 1 7 as weâ ve previously noted usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly strong weather conditions similar to those experienced during 2019 which makes distinguishing between underlying usage changes and weather impacts challenging for gulf power the average number of customers increased slightly versus the comparable prior year quarter as it moves beyond the impacts of hurricane michael in 2018 for 2019 gulf powerâ s retail sales declined slightly due to unfavorable weather and a small decline in underlying usage per customer let me now turn to energy resources beginning with a reporting change in our segments given the trans bay cable acquisition during 2019 we have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our competitive transmission business and the management of these projects within our company our reporting for energy resources now includes the results of our nextera energy transmission projects formerly reported in corporate and other segment our 2018 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes resulting in an increase in energy resourcesâ full year 2018 adjusted eps of 0 09 per share incorporating the reporting change energy resources reported fourth quarter 2019 gaap earnings of 433 million or 0 88 per share adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were 326 million or 0 66 per share energy resourcesâ contributions to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased 0 01 versus the prior year comparable period as strong underlying growth from new and existing investments was more than offset by a number of items including the negative 0 14 adjusted eps impact of our refinancing activities which were primarily related to financing breakage costs associated with several wind repowerings as well as energy resourcesâ share of costs associated with the acquisition of the outstanding genesis debt as a reminder while these refinancing activities created a reduction in fourth quarter adjusted earnings they are expected to translate to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders for the full year energy resources reported gaap earnings of 1 81 billion or 3 72 per share and adjusted earnings of 1 7 billion or 3 49 per share energy resourcesâ full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased 0 35 or approximately 11 versus 2018 for the full year growth was driven by continued additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by 0 55 per share contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines increased by 0 13 versus the prior year also contributing favorably were the customer supply and trading business where contributions increased by 0 05 versus 2018 and nextera energy transmission which increased results 0 04 year over year primarily as a result of the trans bay cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019 these favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense reflecting the negative 0 14 adjusted eps impact in the fourth quarter of refinancing activities as well as growth in the business and lower contributions from the existing generation assets in 2019 wind resource was 96 of the long term average down from 97 a year earlier additional details are shown on the accompanying slide in 2019 energy resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind solar and battery storage projects commissioning approximately 2 700 megawatts of renewables projects in the u s including repowering since the last call we have added 1 609 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog including approximately 500 megawatts of combined new wind and repowering 700 megawatts of solar and 340 megawatts of battery storage all of which will be paired with new solar projects energy resources has now placed a total of approximately 3 700 megawatts of repowering projects in service since 2017 which represents approximately one third of its operating wind portfolio as of year end 2016 we expect that by the end of 2020 more than 60 of energy resourcesâ operating wind projects will have been originally recommissioned or repowered within the last five years highlighting the young age of the overall fleet and the expected long date future value creation of the portfolio following the terrific origination year in 2019 and with nearly three years remaining in the period we are now within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year for the post 2022 period our backlog is already more than 2 400 megawatts placing us far ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage the accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands beyond renewables as of year end 2019 the mountain valley pipeline was approximately 90 complete we have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for the pipeline and we continue to make good progress on these efforts we expect that the issues related to mvpâ s biological opinion and nationwide 12 permit will be resolved in the spring allowing construction work along much of the route to resume we also remain hopeful that the supreme court will overturn the fourth circuit courtâ s original decision on atlantic coast pipelineâ s case related to its appalachian trail crossing authorization resolving similar challenges for mvp we continue to target a full in service date for the pipeline during 2020 and an overall project cost estimate of approximately 5 4 billion turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy for the fourth quarter of 2019 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 975 million or 1 99 per share nextera energyâ s fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 706 million or 1 44 per share respectively for the full year 2019 gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was 3 77 billion or 7 76 per share adjusted earnings were 4 06 billion or 8 37 per share for the corporate and other segment adjusted earnings for the full year decreased 0 35 per share compared to the 2018 prior comparable period primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the gulf power acquisition financing nextera energy also delivered strong operating cash flow growth which increased at a faster rate than the adjusted eps growth rate as expected during 2019 we also maintained our strong credit position based on the s p methodology we estimate that we ended the year at a 22 5 ffo to debt level versus our current downgrade threshold of 21 for moodyâ s we expect 2019 cfo pre working capital to debt was 19 6 versus our current downgrade threshold of 18 nextera energyâ s cushion versus our credit metrics reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and supports the record roughly 14 billion of capital investments that we expect to make in 2020 the financial expectations that we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged we continue to expect that nextera energyâ s adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6 to 8 through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted eps of 7 70 plus the accretion of 0 15 and 0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2020 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 8 70 to 9 20 and as jim highlighted we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range this year we do expect that our adjusted eps growth will be more weighted towards the second half of the year for 2022 we expect to grow adjusted eps in the range of 6 to 8 off 2021 adjusted eps translating to a range of 10 to 10 75 per share from 2018 to 2022 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range as always all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats including but not limited to normal weather and operating conditions let me now turn to nextera energy partners which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2019 fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 280 million and cash available for distribution was 101 million an increase of 70 and 130 respectively the strong growth was driven primarily by the significant year over year growth in nextera energy partnersâ portfolio including the 2019 acquisitions of the energy resourcesâ assets and the meade pipeline company as well as a full quarterâ s contribution from the portfolio of projects that were acquired in late 2018 for the full year 2019 adjusted ebitda was 1 1 billion up 25 year over year cash available for distribution excluding all contributions from our desert sunlight projects was 366 million an increase of 8 from the prior year including full contributions from the desert sunlight projects nextera energy partners achieved cafd growth 20 versus 2018 similar to the quarterly results full year growth in both adjusted ebitda and cafd was primarily driven by portfolio growth the benefit from new projects was partially offset by the divestiture of canadian assets during 2018 cash available for distribution was also reduced by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results include the impact of idr fees which we treat as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide yesterday the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of 0 535 per common unit or 2 14 per unit on an annualized basis up 15 from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2019 as jim mentioned during 2019 nextera energy partners executed several financings for the benefit of lp unit holders in addition to raising approximately 1 2 billion of unsecured holding company notes which priced at some of the lowest spreads ever in the sector nextera energy partners also raised 1 4 billion of low cost project finance debt and executed a 1 3 billion revolver extension nextera energy partners also raised 1 8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings with low initial coupons the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to lp unit holders allowing nextera energy partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth which will also as a result lower future financing needs in addition to reduced future asset and equity needs these financings provide nextera energy partners the flexibility to convert into common units at no discount over a long period of time this should be accretive to lp unit holders who retain all of the unit price upside as nextera energy partners executes on its expected distribution growth objectives these attributes combined with the significant flexibility that nextera energy partners retains with the financings including the timing of conversion option to convert at any price option to pay the buyout in cash rather units and the option to deploy the buyout amount into other assets should generate significant value to lp unit holders while also providing significant downside protection finally last quarter following the achievement of certain nextera energy partners units trading thresholds we converted the second tranche of the convertible preferred securities that we issued in 2017 into an additional roughly 4 7 million nextera energy partners common units further supporting our ongoing goal of using low cost financing products to layer in equity over time the nextera energy partners portfolio at year end 2019 supports the revised adjusted ebitda and cafd december 31 2019 run rate expectations that we announced at the time of the meade acquisition since nextera energy partners long term distribution growth expectations are supported without the need of additional asset acquisitions until 2021 the december 31 2020 run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda and cafd remain unchanged at the same levels as the year end 2019 run rate expectations including full contributions from pg e related projects year end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of 560 million to 640 million reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020 and assuming normal weather and operating conditions excluding all contributions from the desert sunlight projects nextera energy partners continues to expect a year end 2020 run rate for cafd in the range of 505 million to 585 million year end 2020 run rate adjusted ebitda expectations which assume full contributions from pg e related projects as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized are 1 225 billion to 1 4 billion as a reminder all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of 2 14 we continue to see 12 to 15 growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024 we expect that the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in february 2021 to be in a range of 2 40 to 2 46 per common unit in summary we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have excellent prospects for growth fpl gulf power energy resources and nextera energy partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board the progress we made in 2019 reinforces our long term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute on in 2020 we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions question and answer session operator our first question today comes from greg gordon from evercore isi please go ahead with your question greg gordon thanks congratulations on another very very consistent year performance rebecca kujawa thanks greg good morning greg gordon a couple questions for you based on my back of the envelope math it doesnâ t look like youâ ve earned the maximum allowable roe at florida power light this year can you tell us where you landed on a return on equity basis for fiscal year â 19 rebecca kujawa yes greg from a reported regulatory roe standpoint so what ultimately goes to the florida public service commission we did earn the 11 6 roe as allowed under our settlement agreement you are right we did have some below the line expenses which is typical but those below the line expenses are excluded from that regulatory roe calculation greg gordon got you understood and then when you point out in your slide deck that the majority of your ptcs are now being allocated through tax equity thereâ s a very clear slide in the appendix on that that means that we should be looking at nci on the balance sheet flowing through the income statement as the way that thatâ s flowing through earnings now is that correct rebecca kujawa yes thatâ s correct greg gordon okay and the average amortization of a tax equity deal for a wind project is approximately 10 years is that right rebecca kujawa yes the earnings recognition is roughly coincident with the 10 year ptc range for all of our wind projects that are in ptcs greg gordon right and for a solar deal it would be slightly faster rebecca kujawa yes it typically relates to the recognition of the itc period so for many tax equity structures thatâ s over five years certain tax equity partners prefer a seven year structure and so then it would be over seven years as opposed to five greg gordon right as you guys gear up for preparing for the rate case in 2021 are there any milestones this year or will the majority of the activity be happening in early â 21 rebecca kujawa well as you certainly appreciate thereâ s a ton of milestones that are largely internal for our teams as they get ready for any rate proceeding and many of those preparation efforts started well before this year and are ongoing and we have the incremental work this year of doing all the analysis of thinking about bringing fpl and gulf together but as i highlighted in the prepared remarks based on what we know today our expectation is that we would file a rate case in early â 21 for the new rates effective in 2022 and you know the first start of that would be the filing of the test year letter which we would expect to file in early â 21 greg gordon great my last question is the battery storage backlog is obviously continuing to ramp are you buying battery storage are you buying the product from another vendor or are you buying the components from different oems and building your own bespoke battery storage product in other words are you using a vendor like fluence or one of the other total product companies or are you sourcing components and building your own battery units rebecca kujawa itâ s much more the latter greg we see a tremendous amount of value and are being able to have some nimbleness in where we procure the battery packs but then we also are procuring separately as you suggested things like the containers and the other equipment that you would ultimately use to assemble the battery facility and then also weâ re designing our own management systems we ultimately believe that some of the real value add that weâ re going to be able to add to customers that will likely differentiate us from others is that battery system management because weâ ve talked about with you guys and with others over time that thereâ s probably not one value stream that creates the value for batteries itâ s usually a couple of different applications within the same system and that management system and optimizing that is going to be part of the secret sauce of batteries weâ ve invested a lot of time and energy in thinking through that not only on the energy resources deployments but also for the deployments that weâ ve had at fpl and weâ re learned a tremendous amount and weâ re really excited as we highlighted in the prepared remarks about batteries as a terrific supplement to further renewable deployment certainly in the middle part of the next decade and thereafter as renewables become a significant component of the generation stack in u s power markets greg gordon thanks a lot rebecca kujawa thank you operator our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research please go ahead with your question steve fleishman yes hi good morning just a question first if you could update us on the santee cooper situation and your interest there and then secondly with jea now gone and stock obviously doing very well just kind of overall thought process on m a strategy and opportunities right now thanks james robo steve this is jim iâ ll take that obviously weâ re pretty limited in what we can say about the santee cooper situation other than what iâ ve said previously which is we remain very interested in santee cooper and we think south carolina is a terrific place to do business and thatâ s probably all i can say about that on the jea front i would say weâ re disappointed that the sale process has been terminated we think we could have brought enormous value to the customers and the citizens of jacksonville and we think itâ s unfortunate that itâ s been terminated but that is what it is in terms of future m a activity i will repeat what iâ ve been pretty consistent in terms of what our strategy is on that front which is in terms of what we like we have been very focused first of all i donâ t think thereâ s a utility in the country that wouldnâ t benefit from the application of our playbook that said we have been focused on opportunities in the southeast in the midwest as well as ferc regulated opportunities those are from a regulatory standpoint and other opportunities what we think are the best fit for us and that remains our focus we continue to be very interested in trying to do something that said m a is always hard and there are a lot of hurdles to get over and we will as always be extraordinarily financially disciplined you will never see us announce a deal that we say is strategic and has no accretion so anything that we do will have significant accretion associated with it so i think thatâ s probably the sum total of what i can say on that steve fleishman okay one quick technical question is there a quick and easy way you can quantify the balance sheet capacity available for these ffo to debt metrics at moodyâ s and s p in terms of dollars rebecca kujawa yes weâ re probably not going to quantify it exactly steve as youâ ve heard us say quite a number of times over the years a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us we clearly have some room from our downgrade thresholds which is certainly terrific and is important to us as we think about how do we make sure that weâ re prepared for making investments that we want to make in the future including especially this year setting aside the comments that jim just made on m a just for our organic growth prospects alone we have 14 billion of planned capital investment in our business and having a strong balance sheet as we start to make those investments is incredibly important steve fleishman great thank you operator our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america please go ahead with your question julien dumoulin smith good morning can you hear me rebecca kujawa good morning we can hear you just fine julien dumoulin smith excellent thanks again for all the commentary perhaps kicking if off on the retiring front would just be curious on your thoughts on the â 24 opportunity now given the ptc extension how does that shift your thinking and logic around incremental repowering i know you provided already some fairly detailed remarks on repowering already but i want to dig in on that specific opportunity especially given that thatâ s a year already after the timeline for the solar itc here if you can elaborate rebecca kujawa sure of course as we highlighted in our development expectations that we laid out this summer for the 2019 through 2022 time frame youâ ll note that the repowering opportunities that we saw were heavily and at that time exclusively in the 2019 to 2020 time frame and weâ ve continued to work on opportunities to repower assets at both an 80 ptc and a 60 ptc so first weâ ll focus in the 80 before we even think about the extensions of anything thatâ s possible in 60 remember thereâ s always a trade off in making these investment opportunities part of the economic value of that is getting the new set of ptcs and so thereâ s a balance of the cost of the investment that you need to make in that equipment and also ensuring that you can meet the irs test of the 80 20 valuation and as the ptc value goes down it gets a little bit harder to justify both of those requirements again we thought it was a terrific program created a huge amount of shareholder value really highlights the option value embedded in our portfolio and weâ ll continue to be creative and work towards creating more opportunities like that or things that are analogous to it in the future julien dumoulin smith got it excellent just clarifying the last question a little bit you mentioned ferc regulated opportunities jim can you elaborate a little bit further on the thought process there obviously this transmission roe question has been lingering across the sector i just want to make sure we heard you right as to how youâ re thinking about the various ferc asset classes james robo yes so obviously we did the trans bay acquisition thatâ s not in the midwest or the southeast and we do on a long term basis like ferc regulated assets notwithstanding the recent roe decision on the miso transmission owners listen i think thereâ s been you know obviously thatâ s an open docket at ferc right now i probably canâ t comment on what i think the outcomes are going to be there other than to say i do believe ferc regulation will be constructive in the long term and we think in the long term itâ s a good place for us to deploy capital julien dumoulin smith maybe jim if i can one more quickly on esg as you think about establishing targets and becoming perhaps more prescriptive and being a leader on this front how do you think about being more specific on carbon i know this comes up a little bit but iâ m curious on the thought process there i know itâ s also complicated too james robo sure i think we have been pretty specific about what our 2025 goal is which is remember all of these discussions are about percent reductions we started at an enormously lower level than the rest of the industry on just base co2 emissions per megawatt hour generated so any of the goals that we lay out which our goal is a 67 reduction off our 2005 base by 2025 i think if you went back and you looked at the 2005 u s average and compared our nextera rate in 2025 to that 2005 average iâ m going to give you a number and everyone is going to go check me on it that would be an 85 or 90 reduction relative to the 2005 u s average co2 emissions rate we are going to significantly decarbonize our company and our emissions and iâ m really excited about the goals weâ ve set i think they are very doable and what iâ m most excited about is the role that we can play both in florida and in the rest of the country in terms of leading the way to decarbonize not just the electric sector but the transportation sector thereâ s lots more to do as i said in my prepared remarks i think the country has a lot more to do and the great news for the country and the economy is you can be clean and low cost at the same time and whatever we do will be for the benefit of the customers and it will drive good economics better gdp growth for the country lower costs and obviously a better environmental profile julien dumoulin smith thanks for the time i appreciate it operator our next question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim partners please go ahead with your question shahriar pourreza hey good morning guys just on the near backlog itâ s obviously very strong again so iâ m just trying to get a sense rebecca on how much of that backlog increase mainly on the wind side was attributed to a pull forward of projects with the modest ptc extension versus actual incremental opportunities youâ re seeing as we think about modeling forward rebecca kujawa yes i donâ t think itâ s very much i think itâ s early obviously the ptc extension happened very very late in 2019 so i donâ t think weâ ve seen any impacts from it whatsoever coupled with the fact that itâ s quite a number of years down the road it doesnâ t affect the profile of the ptc in the next three years which is really what was driving a lot of our customersâ actions in terms of overall demand and how thatâ s reflected as weâ ve said in the past we thought 2020 was going to be a significant development year clearly it is for wind and that 2021 is more likely than not to be roughly comparable with where we were in 2019 and we continue to see really strong interest from our customers about wind in the long term as they should be as jim highlighted the cost of wind and solar projects out in the mid 2020s assuming there are not any meaningful extensions of the incentives which is an assumption at this point that should be checked but assuming those incentives are not extended are very competitive versus existing coal and nuclear plants and some less efficient gas fired plants so economics should continue to drive decisions for our customers for many many years to come shahriar pourreza got it then just lastly thanks for the incremental disclosures around gulf is there anything you can maybe provide directionally on the base assumptions youâ re assuming in â 22 as weâ re thinking about your eps guidance i e maybe from a regulatory construct or even addition to spending opportunities like the extension of sobra is there anything you can provide directionally on how youâ re thinking about this rebecca kujawa not much beyond what weâ ve already talked about in terms of everything thatâ s built into our expectations for 2020 through 2022 and as you recall from the investor conference materials we did lay out a lot of the details for both businesses through 2021 and of course more detail for energy resources out in â 22 but the fundamentals are very consistent with what weâ ve been doing for a long time on the regulated businesses again focusing on good capital investment that adds value for our customers and taking cost out of the business to ensure that we have very thoughtful views on customer bills and in the case of gulf power targeting a meaningful decline in the bills out to the mid 2020s so keep doing what weâ re doing and we couldnâ t be more excited about the growth opportunities for all of the businesses that lay out in front of us shahriar pourreza got it so stay tuned around the cap structure and the reserve amortization and how youâ re thinking about chewing up between the two utilities rebecca kujawa absolutely shahriar pourreza okay great congrats guys rebecca kujawa thank you operator our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit suisse please go ahead with your question unknown analyst hi just on behalf of mike thanks for taking the questions just a check on the battery growth youâ re talking about can you talk about these reductions youâ re seeing on the battery systems for the projects in the pipe and would it be possible to quantify the scale of opportunity for retrofits on existing sites either at neer or at nep rebecca kujawa in terms of battery cost weâ ve laid out some of our thoughts and expectations i think most recently in our eei investor presentation we havenâ t broken out a lot of the detail between battery back and the rest of the balance of system costs but everything that weâ ve laid out in terms of where weâ ve seen the market declines coming from in aggregate has really started to materialize and whereas two years ago we were surprised at how much faster costs were coming down weâ ve gotten more aggressive with our assumptions and now theyâ re roughly consistent with what we were thinking we continue to be very optimistic longer term about batteries and as the whole industry has talked about itâ s really not about the power sector itâ s being driven much more by the electric vehicle sector and those drivers appear to be pretty clear for quite a number of years down the road which is really driving the manufacturing efficiencies and scale that weâ re seeing on a battery pack side so really excited about optimistic about where that business is headed unknown analyst got it could you just comment on the retrofit opportunity for either neer or nep for batteries and would it be possible to get the tax credits on adding storage to an existing solar project rebecca kujawa you know it could obviously be a significant opportunity coincident with the significant deployment of particularly where the penetration is high adding batteries to existing solar sites could be very advantageous to the extent that theyâ ve elected the itc and ultimately are being used to charge the battery system yes they would qualify for itcs as long as we meet certain conditions itâ s a terrific opportunity for the team but itâ s really consistent with what weâ ve been thinking about for the overall market opportunity and what weâ ve been highlighting for quite some time now to investors unknown analyst got it just one last question from me if you could talk about the impact on interest rates on nepâ s ability to execute the convertible refinancings thank you rebecca kujawa itâ s been terrific a low interest rate environment is obviously terrific for both of our businesses we love low cost of capital to be able to deploy these solutions as economically as possible for both our customers on the energy resources side as well as regulated utilities and of course also for nextera energy partners itâ s been terrific unknown analyst thanks operator ladies and gentlemen with that we will conclude todayâ s question and answer session as well as todayâ s conference we do thank you for attending todayâ s presentation you may now disconnect your lines
spread the love finance minister mthuli ncube yesterday met international monetary fund imf managing director kristalina georgieva to discuss among other pressing issues the country s crisis hit economy on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos switzerland ahead of a crucial meeting on zimbabwe next month at the meeting scheduled for washington dc the bretton woods institution will explore ways of rescuing the imploding economy the deliberations will be pivotal in deciding the fate of the imf staff monitored programme smp following the government s failure to meet the economic agreement s set targets ncube s meeting with georgieva comes at a time negotiations over the re calibration of the smp remain in limbo after government and the imf team failed to reach consensus the smp is an informal arrangement between the government and the imf to monitor the implementation of key economic programmes in the country it is designed to support zimbabwe s reform agenda the smp covers the period may 15 2019 to march 15 2020 we discussed the zimbabwe economy and reforms and smp the need for more social protection of the vulnerable due to drought and arrears debt clearance roadmap good meeting ncube wrote on microblogging site twitter after the meeting with georgieva yesterday however the meeting sources said will not influence the decision to be made on the smp as georgieva will only be guided by the recommendations made by the imf team which visited zimbabwe in december last year the delegation was led by imf adviser gene leon sources said the imf board meeting will be held in washington dc in late february where the article iv consultations with zimbabwe will be discussed during consultations an imf team of economists visits a country to assess economic and financial developments with government and central bank officials a summary of the imf board s views is subsequently transmitted to the country s government the imf will hold a board meeting on article iv consultation with zimbabwe in late february a source revealed the meeting will discuss the problems zimbabwe is facing right now and the way forward as well as the smp the meeting will be based on the mission s visit in december last year and there will be a report on the outcome of the meeting which should be available in early march shortly after that there should be another mission visit to zimbabwe where the issue of the smp will be discussed the imf has already raised a red flag over the country s failure to meet targets on inflation and government s controversial spending especially on deals with sakunda holdings a company linked to president emmerson mnangagwa s backer kuda tagwirei government has admitted that it failed to meet the targets set out in the initial smp but feels the process can still continue in a prior meeting the imf painted a grim picture of the economic situation and was critical of the government s disastrous fiscal consolidation measures which have resulted in a volatile exchange rate and hyperinflation the imf said urgent measures need to be taken to address the crisis policy actions are urgently needed to tackle the root causes of economic instability and enable private sector led growth the key challenge is to contain fiscal spending consistent with non inflationary financing and tighten monetary policy to stabilise the exchange rate and start rebuilding confidence in the national currency the imf said in a statement after its visit in september last year in his 2020 national budget finance minister ncube said he had missed fiscal reform targets under the transitional stabilisation programme tsp and the smp presenting the opposition movement for democratic change s position to the imf late last year former finance minister and the party s vice president tendai biti said the country is not in a position to implement an smp the mdc notes that the imf in may of 2019 agreed a staff monitored programme with the government of zimbabwe biti said we maintain that the fundamental challenge with the imf is that it fails to locate the crisis in the deeper structural political issues that are arresting zimbabwe particularly the crisis of legitimacy arising out of the coup of november 2017 and the contested election of july 2018 the solutions proposed in zimbabwe by the imf in the smp are economocentrist the answer to the zimbabwe crisis does not lie in economics it lies in the urgent resolution of deep structural political crisis arresting our country biti argued that the imf is turning a blind eye to the country s budget deficit our strong position is that zimbabwe was not ready for an smp the smp was not supposed to be negotiated and concluded in the first place since 2014 zimbabwe has been unable to meet targets that it set out for itself these targets include macro economic aggregates such as gdp growth rate expenditure revenue targets and inflation biti pointed out consistently zimbabwe has maintained a budget deficit monetised through legal and extra legal means including issuance of treasury bills and running an unlawful overdraft facility with the central bank the imf has turned a blind eye to this budget deficit biti said granting an smp to the country was an attempt to marinate an incorrigible regime that is incapable of meeting its own targets zimbabwe could not be ready for an smp its public finance management system is shambolic and the ministry of finance has violated the constitution public finance management act and the public debt management act biti said in the opposition party s position paper to the imf in our view what is needed is fiscal consolidation which cannot be addressed without dealing with the wage bill which is

on acquired loans the increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances and the yields earned on those balances partially offset by an increase in the volume and cost of interest bearing liabilities as we funded the increase in interest earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 3 6 million due to increases in the volume of interest earning assets this increase was partially offset by increases in interest expense of 0 7 million due to an increase in volume and 0 7 million due to an increase in cost of interest bearing liabilities compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the company s net interest margin was 3 44 for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to 3 48 for the quarter ended september 30 2019 and 3 53 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the

securities the decrease in net interest margin for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended september 30 2019 was driven by a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets partially offset by an improvement in our cost of funds the decrease in net interest margin for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2018 was driven by an increase in the cost of funds required to fund the increase in assets exclusive of the interest income accretion from the acquisition of loans discussed above as well as interest recoveries of 56 4 thousand 24 3 thousand and 0 1 million in the quarters ended december 31 2019 september 30 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively net interest margin remained stable at 3 39 for the quarters ended

quarter ended september 30 2019 reflects the decrease in rates paid for our interest bearing demand deposits the increase in the cost of deposits compared to the quarter ended december 31 2018 resulted from the increase in the volume and rates paid for time deposits during the year ended december 31 2018 the federal reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points which affected the rates that the bank offered on its time deposits in order to remain competitive in our markets and attract new deposits the federal reserve did not begin lowering rates until august 1 2019 the bank experienced significant time deposit growth at the higher rates which contributed to the increase in the cost of time deposits paid in 2019 the overall costs of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2019 decreased four basis points to 1 69 compared to 1 73 for the quarter ended september 30 2019 and increased 19 basis points compared to 1 50 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the decrease in the cost of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended september 30 2019 resulted from both lower cost of deposits and short term borrowings the increase in the cost of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2018 is mainly a result of an increase in the cost of deposits but is also driven by the increased cost of borrowed funds including the subordinated debt issued in november 2019 used to finance loan and investment activity noninterest income noninterest income for the fourth and third quarters of 2019 totaled 1 6 million an increase of 0 8 million or 88 4 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in noninterest income compared to the quarter ended december 31

noninterest expense for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended september 30 2019 is mainly attributable to the 0 8 million increases in both acquisition expenses and other operating expenses during the quarter ended december 31 2019 1 0 million was recorded in acquisition expense primarily related to the bank of york acquisition the increase in other operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in bank shares taxes as well as other expenses resulting from the company s growth the increase in noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to the 1 5 million and 0 7 million increases in salaries and employee benefits and acquisition expenses respectively the increase in salaries and

shows rises in the medium and long terms the sino american trade deal has boosted the mood but now president donald trump is focusing on europe eur usd has failed to recover amid fears of auto tariffs a cautious central bank and despite upbeat figures will it extend its falls the last week of the first month of 2020 features the fed gdp from both sides of the atlantic ez inflation and more this week in eur usd upbeat figures tariff fears one trade front is closed but another one has opened while visiting the world economic forum in davos the us president met his french counterpart emmanuel macron and both men agreed to refrain from new tariffs on each others countries however trump later threatened to slap levies on european cars if negotiations fail to advance the us is unhappy with france s tech tax and with an alleged imbalance in automobile tariffs his comments echoed by other american officials weighed on the euro eur usd failed to recover even when the dollar came under broad selling pressure amid diminishing fears the coronavirus scare initially sent investors to the safety of the greenback and the yen however china s steps to curb the spread of the respiratory disease later calmed markets a case of the sars like virus was also reported in america but the danger seems limited the european central bank left its policy unchanged and announced a strategic review as expected what moved the euro to the downside was the caution regarding the recent upbeat economic data president christine lagarde s lackluster comments on the latest data and also her inclusion of climate considerations that could mean additional stimulus both weighed on the common currency germany s zew economic sentiment beat expectations with 15 points but the common currency s bounce was only temporary the same reaction was seen in response to upbeat german purchasing managers indexes the forward looking figures for both the services and manufacturing sectors exceeded forecasts in january but the rise of eur usd was short lived while trump spent time in davos his impeachment trial kicked off back home mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader set out a tight timetable and refrained from summoning witnesses the republicans aim to conclude the process as soon as possible without any significant dissents politicos expect a quick acquittal euro zone events

criticized britain s brexit policy angering the government in london after zew and pmis the last significant business survey comes from ifo on monday economists expect germany s no thinktank to show a minor decline in its business climate gauge as well as other figures the continent s powerhouse remains in the spotlight on tuesday the number of unemployed disappointed with an increase in november and december s statistics are set to show a recent decline preliminary german consumer prices index data sets the stage for the all european figure on the following day the best is kept for last on friday the eurozone publishes initial cpi estimates for january while headline prices are forecast to rise to 1 5 annually economists expect core cpi to remain unchanged at 1 3 the ecb is closely watching updated gross domestic product figures are published at the same time and they will likely confirm the 0 2 quarterly growth rate in the fourth quarter any deviation would rock the euro the bigger question for markets is will the german government open its purse strings apart from the ecb s constant calls berlin is also pressured by brussels the european commission s ambitious green deal requires spending to reach the 2050 carbon neutral goal any such signs from the continent s locomotive may boost the euro while sticking to its fiscal orthodoxy will likely keep the lid on the common currency here are the events lined up in the euro zone on the forex calendar us events fed and gdp compete for attention while the us wants to advance with phase two of the trade talks soon china seems reluctant and many expect earnest negotiations only after the us presidential elections trump s impeachment trial continues in washington but as long as critical witnesses remain out of the debate markets are unlikely to react to the political drama the republican controlled senate is set to acquit trump probably in early february the us economic calendar is busy it starts with new home sales for december which are forecast to hold onto elevated levels above 700k annualized durable goods orders for the last month of 2019 will be closely watched as these investment figures feed into growth calculations after a substantial drop in november a bump up is on the cards the nondefense ex aircraft measure the core of the core is projected to edge up as well the federal reserve announces its initial decision for 2020 and it is expected to leave the interest rate unchanged after three consecutive cuts the fed signaled that it is taking a long pause as officials are satisfied with the economic situation and with their policies jerome powell chairman of the federal reserve set a higher bar for raising rates than for cutting them a deteriorating outlook would be sufficient for a rate cut on the other hand he would wait for inflation to sustainably top the 2 level before considering a hike to borrowing costs will this skepticism about inflation persist hints about future borrowing costs and several other factors are set to rock markets see fed preview five things that will determine the dollar s direction the action continues after the fed primarily with the first release of gdp figures for the fourth quarter of 2019 after posting annualized growth of 2 1 in the third quarter economists expect the expansion to have hovered around the 2 mark once again apart from the headline markets will want to see a pick up in investment that has been lagging behind robust consumer spending it is essential to note that the fed probably receives early access to the figures and chair powell may drop a hint ahead of the publication is he is not cautious enough the central bank s preferred gauge of inflation is the last substantial release of the week the core personal consumption expenditure gauge stood at 1 6 in november and will likely remain around those levels in the report for december personal income personal spending and also the revised version of the university of michigan s consumer sentiment are of interest here are the scheduled events in the us eur usd technical analysis euro dollar broke below the uptrend support that accompanied it hit 1

double bottom dating back to the summer the 1 0879 level mentioned earlier is the next level to watch 1 1040 was a swing low in december and is still fought over further resistance awaits at 1 1120 which worked as both support and resistance in january it is followed by 1 1175 a high point earlier in the month the late december peak of 1 1240 is the next upside target eur usd sentiment how long can the common currency ignore improving fundamentals eur usd has room to rebound from the lows especially if the fed echoes the ecb s caution the fxstreet poll is showing a bearish trend in the short

manufacturing figure is still pointing to contraction in the sector gbp usd volatility considerably increased as speculation mounted us dollar movements also had their share in rocking the currency

uk economic calendar the consensus of economists is pointing to the boe holding rates but bond markets see it as a coin flip apart from the decision the level of support it receives is critical the nine strong monetary policy committee will likely be split in any case mark carney the outgoing governor of the boe may find himself in the minority in his last rate event before passing the baton to andrew bailey the old lady will also convey a message about future decisions and that may whipsaw the pound a hawkish cut or a dovish hold signaling the opposite of the decision cannot be ruled out for all the details see boe preview carney to cause carnage with a hawkish cut four scenarios for gbp usd the uk brexits on the following day but retains most of its rights and obligations within the

investment have they picked up as the us and china were nearing an accord the data also feeds into growth figures due out later in the week the federal reserve s decision on wednesday is the main event of the week the fed is expected to leave rates unchanged and continue signaling an extended pause in its previous decision in december the bank cut rates but also said that current levels are appropriate since then fed officials have echoed this message while economic figures have been on the softer side but uncertainty has dropped after the sino american trade deal while the fed will try not rocking the boat markets will be scrutinizing every word in the rate statement and the accompanying press conference by jerome powell chairman of the federal reserve see fed preview five things that will determine the dollar s direction the first read of gross domestic product figures for the fourth quarter of 2019 is predicted to show that growth is close to 2 1 annualized seen in the third

only to see it snap back to the range gbp usd sentiment it is hard to know what carney and his colleagues are thinking but cutting rates has marginally higher odds that could send sterling down but the move may stall if the bank signals a pause the fx poll is showing a bullish bias in all timeframes are experts pricing out a boe cut targets are barely changed from the previous week s poll and seem more cautious on average than recent sterling volatility related forecasts
president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers broadman said it s not clear to me what the actual economic impact will be as a dispute resolution measure to threaten china with more tariffs
as hong kong s chief executive carrie lam led a huge delegation to this week s world economic forum in davos switzerland aimed at soothing investors nerves given the ongoing domestic strife in the

continue to be the major headwind for economic development in hong kong said wang chunxin principal economist at bank of china hong kong he expects the city s economy to rebound slightly in 2020 with annual gdp growth at about 1 per cent the impact of ongoing protests led moody s to downgrade hong kong s sovereign rating to aa3 from aa2 this month the ratings agency said the move principally

capital attributed to ongoing protests in hong kong in taiwan the independently ruled island that china claims as its own president tsai ing wen was re elected with a record majority this month taiwanese scepticism over ties with china only been further deepened by recent social unrest in hong kong said vincent tsui asia analyst at gavekal dragonomics the protests which began peacefully late in april 2019 then turned violent in june were sparked by a proposal to amend fugitive offenders legislation that would have allowed extradition to mainland china although the bill was shelved demonstrations calling for its permanent withdrawal morphed into a broader set of grievances some of which focused on economic inequality hong kong s gini coefficient in which zero represents maximum

per cent dip in the third quarter according to savills data given how hard hit the retail and hospitality industries have been these sectors are coming under severe cost pressures said ricky lau head of office leasing at savills he expects office rents to fall 5 15 per cent in 2020 the residential property market has also been hit data compiled by midland a real estate agency showed that an average of 4 649 transactions occurred monthly in the june to august 2019 period 37 per cent fewer than the 7 410 average monthly transactions in march to may the imf noted that hong kong s robust policy frameworks and ample buffers would help it meet challenges this has demonstrated hong kong s resilience said simon mak chairman of ascent partners a financial consultancy i am highly optimistic about the hong kong economy in 2020 the city is a key international finance centre and its proximity to china is vital hong kong remains a favourite of multinational corporations who consider the city a golden gateway to the china market said mr lau that should help fend off competition from potential rivals such as singapore which is seeing an increasing number of inquiries from asset management funds about relocation singapore is an obvious alternative but longer flight times to china and high operational costs are still factors which will render any mass corporate migration unlikely mr lau said hong kong based companies have also weathered the storm infrastructure groups directly targeted by protests such as mtr corporation and airport authority hong kong vulnerable to declining passenger flow damage to properties and lower rental reversions said cindy huang credit analyst at s p global ratings but she added what is perhaps more surprising is how resilient hong kong companies have been so far this is attributable to high historic profitability robust cash holdings and conservative leverage and their often oligopolistic market positions hong kong also has to weather external factors beyond the local protest movement such as a slowing china and continuing trade tensions the development of china us economic relations in either direction has the potential to have a significant influence on the overall economy of hong kong said ulrich boettger hong kong director of the german industrial giant basf
a look ahead after a year when the economy seemed to be in a state of suspension the malaysian economy seemed to be in a state of suspension in 2019 while observers expected a burst of economic activity in line with the promises made during pakatan harapan s ascent to power in 2018 the year delivered little terms of economic growth in fact the third quarter of 2019 offered a disappointing 4 4 percent gdp growth the year as a whole is expected to chalk up no more than 4 6 percent growth for malaysia by comparison the adb forecasts that other asean countries will do better indonesia with 5 1 percent and 6 percent and 6 9 percent for the philippines and vietnam respectively these countries are of course at a lower stage of economic development but the comparison is a reminder that malaysia is not the sole attractor of trade and investment in southeast asia the malaysian stock market is performing poorly as is the malaysian ringgit when compared to early 2018 when the u s dollar traded for around rm3 86 but that may not be the fairest of comparisons since the anxieties surrounding the u s china trade war were not at their height then early in 2019 the ringgit was stronger against the u s dollar marking around rm4 05 to the dollar from august to october a u s dollar traded for slightly above rm4 17 touching rm4 11 in december tensions due to the trade war seem to have impacted the ringgit still trade did very well malaysia s trade surplus from january to september increased by 15 3 percent and amounted to rm100 9 billion 24 7 billion during the same period in 2018 the trade surplus was only rm87 billion 21 billion the trade surplus for october was just as strong surpassing that of the previous year the u s china trade war occupied considerable space in local debates commentators generally felt that the trade war would benefit malaysia if prolonged though not as much as vietnam since malaysia cannot compete based on cost structure the restructuring of global value chains and the relocation of investment was also expected to work in malaysia s favor this was seemingly backed by empirical evidence not least the fact that fdi approvals across all sectors rose to rm49 5 billion 12 1 billion in the first half of 2019 representing a 97 2 percent increase from rm25 1 billion 6 1 billion in the same period last year the manufacturing sector was a significant beneficiary fdi rose by 74 2 per cent to rm33 1 billion 8 billion in that sector compared to rm19 0 billion or 4 6 billion in 2018 the united states was the biggest source of approved manufacturing fdi rm11 7 billion or 2 9 billion followed by china rm4 8 billion or 1 2 billion singapore rm3 1 billion or 800 000 and japan rm2 1 billion or 500 000 while there are several bright spots on the horizon all is not well with confidence in the malaysian economy the vistage mier ceo confidence index for the last quarter of 2019 closed at 85 3 falling to a four year low almost half the respondents felt the economy had worsened in recent months the ceo confidence index represents a slice of the business environment largely capturing the sentiment of ceos of small and medium sized businesses who make up 80 percent of its members the index for current economic conditions stands at 63 points indicating ceos lack of confidence in the prevailing economic circumstances there is no doubt that the previous government under former prime minister najib razak created several serious problems high debt being the primary issue blame should be given where due but to wallow in blame does not boost confidence nor does it address the sense that there is a lack of forward guidance from the current government besides there has been a cycle of industrialization projects since the 1990s including the subsidized national car project and other heavy industrialization projects many of which have not been successful commercially this has ignited demands for a sterner set of evaluative criteria that make it difficult to unquestioningly receive the third national car project the rollout of 5g technology and ir4 0 a government initiative aimed at helping businesses grapple with transformative technologies while cynicism about the economy and state backed economic projects is not the most positive reception it carries a healthy skepticism that cannot be disregarded by policymakers there is further skepticism about projects such as ir4 0 and 5g because they are supposedly forward looking it is not clear if the government understands the implications of the fourth industrial revolution and what it means for small and medium sized enterprises many companies may have not fully realized the potentialities of the third industrial revolution nor do they have the resources or willingness to invest in research and development the same is the case with 5g where companies may not be fully utilizing existing 4g infrastructure and lack the requisite expertise to utilize 5g technology statements about using 5g for distance surgery in rural areas may be precocious at this stage due to uncertain levels of technical expertise among surgeons and facilities in these locations old questions regarding the high cost of living the affordability of housing healthcare financing the state of education and the need for upskilling also remain unanswered these questions as well as broader concerns about the economy will need answering if malaysia is to improve its economic standing at home and in the region dr shankaran nambiar is a senior research fellow

interview with bloomberg tv interview with christine lagarde president of the ecb conducted by francine lacqua and broadcast on 24 january 24 january 2020 we are delighted to be joined right here on bloomberg by the european central bank president she s christine lagarde madame lagarde thank you so much for giving us a little bit of your busy schedule when you look at the strategy review event you really laid out what you were trying to achieve yesterday in the press conference at this moment what do you see as the biggest challenge for it the biggest challenge is going to be to harness all the views all the assessments all the convictions into a direction that will actually serve the purpose that we have been assigned which is guaranteed price stability in the economy now that seems like a very dry proposal but the whole point is to actually create the ground maintain the ground and fertilise the ground so that there is growth so that there are jobs and so that the economies of the euro area are working well and hopefully are generating some good value for the citizens of the euro area that s the purpose you said that you have a preference on how you would look at inflation but you wouldn t say why now i have a preference on many topics i have views and i m not an idiot yes i do have views in relation to how we can procure this price stability how financial stability has to be taken into account how we take into account the risks of climate change and the impact that it has on many aspects of the work that we ve been doing i do have those views and all the people around the table have those views i think my job as president is to facilitate the expression the rallying of views around various themes one of which will be the inflation objective setting if you will which may take multiple forms but which is one of the anchors that will determine our discussions but i don t think that a president right from the get go as we are just about to embark on the process should state this is my view i don t want to preclude others from expressing theirs and i don t want to over influence the debate is it about the consensus building or is it just about not influencing lagarde it s a combination of both there are very strong members around the table and i don t think that they will be under any kind of influence other than reviewing the facts understanding the reactions understanding the response understanding the effectiveness of what we can do the world has changed so dramatically over the last 20 you know last time we had a strategy review was in 2003 the growth was much higher in those days inflation was higher the prospects for the various demographics around the world were different the world has massively changed we didn t use social media as much as we do we hardly had the cell phone in those days can you give us then a sense of the future timetable for these reviews should it be a regular thing that s to be debated first of all the initial timetable that we are setting for ourselves which is ambitious i acknowledge that is to try to conclude before the end of this year so december 2020 hopefully we will have reached that platform of consensus on the various topics that we have now do we have to repeat the exercise every five years every eight years every 16 years as we have i have my views as well and we will debate that with the group to see how necessary it is how helpful it can be markets are interpreting the exercise as maybe having a little bit of a dovish tilt then you look at housing costs and you look maybe at side effects of negative rates i m an owl i m not a dove i m not a hawk you re an owl there are doves and hawks around the table i get it but what signs should markets be looking at in the review to give us a sense of where it goes if markets are interested in what happens in the next 12 months they should not pay too much attention to the strategy review because we re conducting two separate exercises here we will have our monetary policy assessment and review as usual every six weeks we all get together we look at the numbers we look at the markets we look at the views of the citizens in terms of inflation expectations we decide whether things should be status quo or whether they should vary one way or the other that exercise will be conducted irrespective of the strategy review so to those who say oh it s going to be completely static and stable for 12 months i d say watch out because things change and we might have different signals and we might reconsider we might i don t know at this point in time what i know for sure is that there will be two different exercises and the strategy review will be on its own on a standalone basis and will progress we are looking at what we do in the future not what we do next week or in may or in july is it also a warning to the markets not to over interpret too quickly they always over interpret they re going to look at my face and see well is she smiling is she dovish is she hawkish i told them on day one i said don t over interpret we will say what we can say i know that some people are disappointed that we didn t say much more yesterday but a strategy review starts here finishes there you cannot here say what you are going to do there otherwise you don t do a strategy review we need to do a lot of stock taking looking at the effectiveness of what we have done learning from other countries around the world as well in the process you know that the fed is undergoing the same exercise and we need to take time to reach out to the parliament to academics to people to those who are interested in these issues to hear the voices to understand what their views are we will listen to markets as well but they are one of the voices that we will listen to economists believe that monetary policy at the ecb will be largely on autopilot for the next two years is that a mistake no i just told you as to those who think that it s on autopilot i think that s ridiculous there is forward guidance which is strong which is setting a very clear timetable that is fact dependent but let s look at the facts let s look at how the economy evolves that s what we do we need to be fact driven we need to be clear in our communication and we will be i m saying today don t assume that it will be on autopilot yesterday you talked quite extensively about negative rates you said tiering is working well but is there a point where actually the side effects of negative rates mean that you need to scale it back we will be looking at the side effects as part of the strategy review there is no question about that we need to be attentive to that financial stability is not our first driver of concern and consideration but we will have to look at it of course yes don t forget that we need to have a banking sector in the euro area that acts as a good channel of transmission which means what that you could extend tiering multiple responses as i said yesterday we are not considering that at the moment president trump left davos saying that actually he s still thinking about possible tariffs against germany and europe in general you re seeing growth in europe how do you match up the two we re saying modest growth in europe we re saying a bit more modest downside risks as well so that s probably the reason why it s kind of slightly balanced to the upside but very slightly we shall see what i was pleased about is to see that there had been a good first meeting between ursula von der leyen president of the european commission and president trump it s better to start off on a good footing and there will be difficult relationships going forward and points of negotiation that will be hard whether it s trade whether it s tax whether it s technology whether it s energy there are multiple topics as ursula said europe and the united states have been friends for a long long time it will not go away and in many instances they have joint interests but europe is different europe operates on different values with different systems and that needs to be secured and preserved for the sake of the europeans are tariffs the biggest concern you see for the european economy it s a big concern let s face it don t forget that there is trade intra europe and that would not indeed be affected but trade with the united states which is an important trade partner would be affected if there was a sudden rise in tariffs yes or a tariff war tit for tat you tariff me i ll tariff you that s going to operate as a brake on the economy for sure you ve done a number of public events in the last couple of weeks what concerns have people raised with you you know it varies when i talk to family members they say explain what you do mum please we don t really understand that s a really good signal for me that we need to communicate in a more explicit way about what we procure if we explain exactly what we do it s technically sound the experts will understand family members and the taxi drivers the hairdressers and the shopkeepers are not going to understand if we explain that what we do actually procures growth facilitates investment and creates jobs then it means something but we should not be the only one to try to do that is it reconnecting with the citizens i think that s an important factor yes because people of europe particularly the euro area are quite bullish about the euro they are pleased to have the euro as their currency and we do everything we can to make sure that euros can flow easily that payments are secure that what they have is solid is stability but i think we need to do a bit more a lot of the focus here is on sustainability you talked about sustainability yes is there a danger that we have outsized expectations about what central banks can do to tackle this possibly but i think that nonetheless each and every one of us has to explore what he or she can do about the current risks i think that it has been under the risks caused by climate change to corporates to the economy to general stability have been largely underestimated and for good reasons because many risks are difficult to assess we are talking about what happens in 30 years it s not on the cards of a stress tester to anticipate what happens in 30 years you look at the immediate future you look at the market risks you look at macro risks but the climate risks in 30 years that need action now if we want to remedy those risks that s difficult but we need to do it absolutely do you worry that the more questions you ask lagarde and by the way central bankers can do quite a bit like what if you force for example financial institutions or ask for them to stress test climate change how much complexity does that actually how much cost does it involve and how many more complex issues come up to the surface because of the exercise i say never mind the cost beware of the accident number one so even if it costs something the risk that it protects us against is so much bigger that it s really worth a bit of investment and it s also a source of economic opportunities let s not forget that that s where everybody has to rally at the table because it requires good and probably different accounting principles i m delighted that the big accounting firms are taking this seriously and i hope they deliver it requires the regulators to be on board as well but the policymakers the governments have to take it seriously and not pay lip service to the risk they have to also take the right measures so everybody must be at the table central bankers will not eliminate climate risk on their own they can participate in the process and for my money i ll do the best i can to participate but it s not a business of central banks do chief executives and governments take it seriously or is there a danger that they come to davos and talk about it the governments have to take it seriously they all signed up to the paris agreement not many countries are at the point of beginning to deliver if you see a recession or if you see it tilted downwards for the economy is there a danger that actually all of this goodwill goes out the window we ve seen that in the past and we might see it in the future but i think that the youth around us and public opinion will be around to remind us that this is not something that we can put on the back burner because we have an issue what is the one thing that you would ask of the european commission when it comes to tackling climate change right now do we need a common definition is it carbon pricing it s not just the european commission i think the european commission is completely devoted to this and the green deal as advocated by ursula von der leyen is really a good i would say repurposing of a lot of existing budgets and additional budgets and probably new financial instruments to guarantee and leverage but it also takes the european parliament and they are heading in the right direction identifying a taxonomy without which it would be difficult for others to move and say here we need to take a provision that collateral is not really worth what s on the face of it is this one issue you think europe can speak with a common voice on i would hope so i know it s difficult there are some countries that are still heavily coal dependent but i would hope so just as europe has moved and is moving the world on data protection as it also has moved the world in relation to safety everybody complained about reach at the time reach was this legislation that actually helped better regulate chemicals that could be dangerous for people there are a lot of goods that are used on a daily basis around the world that are safer because of that directive so in that sense europe which is often criticised for being too bureaucratic too government intensive is also helping people but is this one thing that will deliver the real fiscal spending that you and your predecessor have been asking for for a long time well i m watching i don t have a voice concerning fiscal policy so to speak but i have a voice to say our monetary policy is much more effective if you leash out where you have the space on some fiscal tools as well when i look at some countries they are beginning to put money on the table christine lagarde i know you have to go so a final question if you look at the central bank stance around the world there is a lot of talk that central banks are coming to the end of the tools that they have can somehow fiscal spending across the world make up for that first of all i don t think that the central banks have exhausted their tools when conventional policy was heading towards very low rates then new tools were invented these were challenged but eventually they were validated so i think that creativity also applies to central banking number 1 number 2 they won t be a substitute i think it s a coordination an amplification of one by the other if you look at how markets have reacted do you worry that they re out of kilter actually so markets are going up and the world economy is in a little bit of a standstill there are times when i think so is that because they don t price risk i think that some of them clearly do not price the climate change risk for sure yes christine lagarde thank you so much for joining us
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by shrutee sarkar and hari kishan bengaluru reuters a significant global upturn will remain elusive this year as many economies still face an array of daunting risks despite improved sentiment from an initial u s china trade deal and ebullience in financial markets reuters polls showed the global economy in 2019 may have been near its weakest since the financial crisis thanks to trade protectionism and political uncertainty but world stocks had a blowout year with several indexes repeatedly setting record highs related stories with easy policy from central banks set to continue that split between markets and events on the ground may extend into this year according to surveys of over 500 economists covering 46 major economies conducted jan 10 22 when asked what is more likely for developed and emerging market economies this year more than three quarters of nearly 400 economists said about the same as last year in terms of growth rates the world s growth trends are sustainable but fragile we do not see high recession risks in major economies nor do we expect a sharp rise in inflation but we are respectful of late cycle dynamics and various serious political and long term risks said james sweeney chief economist at credit suisse global manufacturing and trade have been in a slump since late 2018 but cyclical indicators are likely to improve in 2020 the rebound is unlikely to be vigorous while very few economists predicted a deeper downturn this year not many more forecast a significant pick up either despite the euphoria surrounding the initial washington beijing trade deal that cooled nearly two years of escalating tensions between the world s two biggest economies in the near term it has certainly removed some downside risks and given sentiment a little bit of a lift said jim o sullivan chief u s macro strategist at td securities in the end we re not expecting that to cause business confidence to roar back we don t think trade policy uncertainty is going away in the latest reuters polls the 2020 growth outlook for nearly 75 of 46 major economies was either cut or left unchanged from the previous poll similarly the outlook for inflation for nearly 85 of those economies was trimmed or left unaltered reuters poll graphic on 2020 economic growth forecast revisions from the october survey most central banks were expected to maintain their easing bias despite increasing scepticism about their ability to influence growth or inflation forecasts for the next likely move were still leaning toward a cut rather than a move away from crisis era policies we continue to see interest rates at record low levels lower for longer is fast becoming lower forever said jan lambregts head of global economics and markets at rabobank while most major central banks have been successful in avoiding a deeper economic downturn they have collectively failed to stimulate demand in their respective economies which is not expected to change at least until 2021 we expect most of the 2020s to be characterized by slow growth and very low inflation said jennifer mckeown head of global economics at capital economics given the low level of neutral real interest rates central banks in advanced economies will struggle to offer any meaningful policy stimulus the global economy was forecast to expand 3 1 this year unchanged from the october median and the weakest since polling began for this period in april 2018 that is only a sliver better than last year the international monetary fund s latest world growth forecast was slowly converging toward the reuters poll consensus lowered to 3 3 from 3 4 their third straight cut to the 2020 outlook the apparent ceasefire in the battle over tariffs removes a downside risk to growth but tariffs remain high and we suspect that tensions will persist in other forms adding to reasons to expect the global economic recovery to be a gradual one added capital economics mckeown reuters poll graphic on global economic outlook emerging market central banks have eased policy aggressively but a rebound in developing economies has also been elusive with growth rates in some of the biggest ones moving in the opposite direction china economic growth is set to slow to a 30 year low of 5 9 this year on more sluggish domestic consumption and global demand for what it exports growth has also slowed sharply in india to around 5 but inflation is rising which may prevent the central bank from cutting rates again in

each non gaap financial measure we present below a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company s non gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company believes these non gaap measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company s historical financial performance and projected future results in many cases non gaap measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude certain disclosed items or non gaap adjustments that the company believes are not representative of underlying business performance for example the company previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions impairment charges and gains on disclosed transactions the reader should be aware that the company may recognize similar losses or gains in the future readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non gaap measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another the tax impact on our pre tax non gaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non gaap adjustments these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions adjusted diluted eps the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps which the company views as a key performance metric we believe it is

woven into the new north american free trade agreement that awaits president donald trump s signature is his ideal of an oil and gas driven energy future untroubled by climate change unbounded by borders unfettered even by economic concerns like the price of metal or supply and demand any number of realities may intrude upon that vision including the imperative to cut fossil fuel emissions but for now the united states mexico canada agreement usmca helps three of the world s biggest energy trading partners defer such considerations at a time when science and the paris agreement on climate change call for an all out effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions it will help corporations export pollution and jobs weaken climate policies and extract more fossil fuels said ben beachy director of the sierra club s living economy program it s a climate failure any way you look at it how do you square that with the science telling us that we have 10 years to avoid a climate catastrophe we re hiring please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom see jobs the oil and gas industry had qualms when trump first moved to scrap the 23 year old north american free trade agreement renegotiating nafta creates risks said the american petroleum institute in an august 2017 position paper but through lobbying over subsequent months the industry helped shape a deal better for its interests than nafta the usmca takes into account the monumental transformations in the north american oil and gas industry since nafta the rise of the canadian oil sands the u s fracking boom the opening of mexico s long nationalized industry to private investment and seeks to maintain them although sen bernie sanders i vt is correct when explaining his opposition to the deal he said it does not even contain the phrase climate change far more significant for the world s energy future is the language it does include here are key oil and gas industry boosting provisions with implications for climate easing costs for oil sands and gas exports in theory nafta provided free trade of oil and gas but in practice canadian producers have been paying about 60 million a year in duties to the united states because of the unusual character of alberta s tar sands oil the viscous bitumen needs to be thinned with diluents so it can flow through pipelines part of the extensive processing that makes alberta s oil so carbon intensive sometimes the diluents are imported from places like peru bolivia and pakistan and have been subject to trade levies but under the usmca s new rules of origin the oil will be considered canadian and duty free as long as no more than 40 percent of the diluent comes from abroad another rule of origin change natural gas will be presumed to have originated in a country even if a portion was imported as liquefied natural gas and fed into that country s pipelines at a regasification facility the point of these changes was to make it easier to qualify for free trade treatment reducing costs for both exporters and importers said teresa polino a washington d c lawyer representing industry on the issue this is one instance where the u s and canadian companies tend to be much more aligned as opposed to fighting each other keeping mexico s oil sector open changing politics in mexico has meant risk for oil and gas producers who only gained the ability to invest in that country s energy sector when former president enrique peña nieto ended the 75 year state monopoly on oil and gas in 2014 that opened the door to deals like the one chevron recently made with mexico s pemex for deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico which peña nieto saw as key to reversing mexico s precipitous slide in oil production the production of petroleum has been declining 6 to 8 percent a year for the last decade or so and without a lot of foreign investment and technology it will continue to decline explains david gantz a fellow at the baker institute s center on the u s and mexico the future of such arrangements was thrown into question with the 2018 election of president andre s manuel lo pez obrador who struck a nationalistic tone and immediately announced he would suspend new private bidding on oil and gas exploration leases until 2021 under the usmca though lo pez obrador has agreed to a kind of most favored nation clause covering u s energy producers which they see as a guarantee that mexico will keep its market open if not the usmca gives them an avenue to challenge any move to close them out giving business a way to challenge government policy canada had a longstanding requirement that offshore drilling companies invest in a research and development fund to benefit coastal communities after exxon s costs in the program increased for its newfoundland and labrador operations the company in 2012 successfully challenged those rules as impermissible under nafta subjecting canada to penalties that is just one way that the oil and gas industry has used nafta s so called investor state dispute settlement isds process a controversial path for addressing disputes outside the court system the usmca greatly scales back the isds phasing it out between canada and the u s over three years but the process is retained between mexico and the u s for a handful of sectors including oil and gas power generation and some transportation services this gives the oil and gas industry an avenue to challenge any changes mexico makes in its market that the industry views as counter to the usmca environmentalists fear the industry also could use the process to challenge future climate policies enacted in the u s or mexico it is one way that beachy said usmca could lock in trump s polluting legacy for potentially decades to come keeping the price of steel and pipeline construction down when the trump administration launched its bid to renegotiate nafta it slapped 25 percent tariffs on steel from canada and mexico and threatened throughout the process to replace the import tax with quotas in the new deal but in the end the trump administration lifted the levy entirely a move that the texas independent producers royalty owners association was seeking throughout the process with texas gov greg abbott weighing in on its behalf the move gives producers greater access to specialty steel for pipeline construction at lower cost to maintain our energy dominance and continue meeting the energy needs of our nation and beyond we need to be able to move unprecedented volumes of oil and natural gas to texas refining complexes and the gulf coast todd staples president of the texas oil gas association said last year that means we need pipelines lots of them staying out of the way of north america oil and gas trade simply because the usmca retains nafta s free trade among the north american nations u s energy companies can avoid a lengthy permitting process they would have faced in their plan for a continuing increase in natural gas exports to mexico u s natural gas exports to mexico by pipeline have soared seven fold in the past decade soaking up the oversupply in production by one estimate the price of u s natural gas would be 30 percent lower without the demand from mexico under u s law the natural gas act exporters would need to go through a lengthy permitting process for such exports to prove they are in the public interest but the law has an exception allowing export applications to be granted without modification or delay for shipments to free trade partners that s why trump s early threats to get rid of nafta altogether were worrisome for the gas industry and why they like usmca it s just one portion of the billions of dollars worth of duty free energy trade that is bound to continue among the north american nations the u s is the number one destination for canadian oil while 56 percent of u s gasoline exports go to mexico house democratic leaders did win some environmental concessions before giving the usmca the support it needed for passage restoring provisions on overfishing illegal taking of flora and fauna and other protections that had been part of nafta but they failed to get the trade agreement to address any of the seven core failures that the environmental community identified in the deal including getting the paris accord included as one of the international environmental treaties that the three nations pledge to maintain house democrats intend that a future administration which recognizes the global climate change crisis will immediately work with canada and mexico to amend the obligation accordingly they said in their summary report on the usmca trump s signature is not the final step for usmca canada has yet to ratify the agreement and although prime minister justin trudeau has said he hopes for quick approval of the legislation his party will introduce next week the opposition party has indicated it may provide resistance in the meantime beachy said environmental groups hope that the strong statements by 10 opponents of the usmca in the senate including sanders and senate minority leader chuck schumer are helping to raise awareness of the tie between trade and climate that helps us set a baseline for future trade negotiations which have to include climate said beachy we cannot let this be the end of

executive officer commented i am very proud of our results as 2019 was a pivotal period in our company s 75 year history highlighted by our initial public offering in may and the closing of our acquisition of wtsb in november we believe we are at a clear inflection point in our business as we successfully execute upon our strategy to scale the significant investments in our systems and infrastructure which continue to have ample room for future growth our fourth quarter 2019 results demonstrate the successful leveraging of our infrastructure as our efficiency ratio improved by almost 400 basis points to 69 7 and our return on average assets increased by 14 basis points to 1 32 annualized as compared to the third quarter of 2019 while we are pleased with our results we recognize that this is a journey and know that we have much more to accomplish importantly our achievements would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees who i would like to thank for their commitment to the bank our customers and the communities in which we work and live mr griffith continued looking forward we are optimistic about the many opportunities that we see to grow the bank the outlook for the texas economy is robust as unemployment remains low and economic activity continues to be healthy which provides a supportive backdrop as we work to accelerate organic loan growth our integration of wtsb is also proceeding smoothly and we have several cross sell initiatives underway given the demand that we see from the wtsb customer base for our mortgage wealth management and trust products which we believe will provide revenue synergies on top of the cost synergies as previously outlined importantly we have gained significant acquisition experience over the last six months working to integrate wtsb and are developing a process that we expect to use in future acquisitions while we still have more work to do to fully integrate wtsb we are now at a point where we can begin exploring additional m a opportunities m a will continue to be an important growth driver for the bank and we see a solid group of potential acquisition candidates across our core markets which would enable south plains to increase the franchise value of the bank for the benefit of all of our stakeholders results of operations quarter ended december 31 2019 net interest

this disruption comes at a time when chinese economic growth already looks fragile and it will unfortunately undo some of the boost in consumer and business sentiment from the china us trade deal said economist eswar prasad former head of the international monetary fund s china unit a broader spread of this disease has the potential to disrupt travel trade and supply chains throughout asia with knock on effects on the world economy since asia is now a key driver of global growth the wuhan coronavirus appeared on the eve of the chinese lunar new year an annual festival that sees hundreds of millions of people travel to their home towns for family celebrations an indonesian health official monitors international passengers as they pass a thermal scanner monitor in yogyakarta getty the quarantines already announced and those that may follow are certain to dent spending on airlines railways hotels restaurants and other parts of the consumer sector that chinese officials have been seeking to develop this couldn t have come at a worse time said jorge guajardo former mexican ambassador to china advertisement on the yangtze river wuhan is a key transport hub for goods moving from china s interior to the coast as well as for north south commercial traffic the city reflects china s role at the centre of pan asian supply chains for electronics pharmaceuticals and automobiles manufacturers in recent days have rushed to get shipments out before the new year festivities government officials will use this annual break to control the outbreak while factories are idle during the roughly three week holiday any serious transportation shutdown has the potential to interrupt supply chains said phil levy chief economist for flexport a freight forwarder it will make a big difference to economic impact how long this virus threat lasts global economy worries the flu like ailment adds to worries over the global economy earlier this month the imf trimmed its 2020 growth forecast from 3 per cent to 2 9 per cent citing weakness in key emerging markets such as india advertisement warwick mckibbin a survey by anu and korea university showed the lasting economic hit from the sars epidemic fairfax chinese officials meanwhile must battle the unexpected health crisis and implement the terms of a new us china trade deal the accord requires china to increase its spending on american goods and services by us200 billion 292 billion over the next two years and begin opening its financial services market by april 1 that could be a major distraction said scott kennedy a china specialist at the centre for strategic and international studies meeting targets in the trade deal would fade in comparison to managing the domestic politics and economics of this crisis previous health scares offer reasons for investor concern at least in the short run in 2014 an ebola outbreak in west africa knocked us markets off course as investors worried about a chilling effect on consumer spending the dow fell nearly 7 per cent between mid september and mid october that year likewise in 2003 as chinese authorities struggled to curb the fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus the msci china index plunged by more than 10 per cent sars ultimately was responsible for the deaths of 774 individuals worldwide according to the us centres for disease control and prevention hit from sars advertisement the economic hit from sars was more lasting according to a study by economists jong wha lee of korea university and warwick mckibbin of the australian national university in a 2004 paper they found that the fast moving virus carved more than 1 per cent from china s economic output and 2 6 per cent from that of hong kong fallout from the disease continued to dampen activity and marginally depress investment in china and hong kong for the next decade the study concluded but markets rebounded swiftly as sars was brought under control indicating that in most such cases any financial damage is short lived oliver jones senior markets economist with capital economics in london wrote in a note to clients wednesday it was awful none of it was done scientifically jorge guajardo former mexican ambassador to china still china already is burdened by soaring government debt meaning officials are less able to offset any economic damage with tax cuts or increased spending china also accounts for twice as great a share of the global economy as it did in 2003 meaning there is greater scope for events there to set the tone in global markets mr jones added advertisement official measures to blunt the disease also are likely to be heavy handed and disruptive according to mr guajardo who was mexico s ambassador to china during a 2009 outbreak of swine flu in that case chinese authorities concluded that the virus had originated in mexico and responded with a draconian crackdown on all mexican citizens whether or not they had recently visited their homeland mr guajardo said individuals including a mexican consular official visiting from cambodia were arbitrarily quarantined for a week it was awful none of it was done scientifically he said investors drew solace from a meeting of the world health organisation who emergency committee which decided for now not to declare the wuhan episode a public health emergency of international concern on twitter patrick chovanec a china specialist and chief strategist at silvercrest asset management offered a chilling reminder of the worst case risks behind everything who does is the spectre of the

reconciliations of non gaap financial measures millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated except for per share data the company presents certain financial measures other than in accordance with u

margin and adjusted effective tax rate on a segment basis these measures include adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in addition to these measures which are presented above we also include certain supplemental non gaap financial measures that are presented below to help the reader understand the impact that our non gaap adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted eps for each non gaap financial measure we present below a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company s non gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap the company believes these non gaap measures provide investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company s historical financial performance and projected future results in many cases non gaap measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude certain disclosed items or non gaap adjustments that the company believes are not representative of underlying business performance for example the company previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions impairment charges and gains on disclosed transactions the reader should be aware that the company may recognize similar losses or gains in the future readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non gaap measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another the tax impact on our pre tax non gaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non gaap adjustments these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions adjusted diluted eps the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps which the company views as a key performance metric we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of our non gaap adjustments as management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance there were no non gaap adjustments to arrive at the adjusted diluted eps in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 for information related to non gaap adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 refer to

million respectively on acquired loans the increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances and the yields earned on those balances partially offset by an increase in the volume and cost of interest bearing liabilities as we funded the increase in interest earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 3 6 million due to increases in the volume of interest earning assets this increase was partially offset by increases in interest expense of 0 7 million due to an increase in volume and 0 7 million due to an increase in cost of interest bearing liabilities compared to

yield on investment securities the decrease in net interest margin for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended september 30 2019 was driven by a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets partially offset by an improvement in our cost of funds the decrease in net interest margin for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2018 was driven by an increase in the cost of funds required to fund the increase in assets exclusive of the interest income accretion from the acquisition of loans discussed above as well as interest recoveries of 56 4 thousand 24 3 thousand and 0 1 million in the quarters ended december 31 2019 september 30 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively net interest margin remained stable at 3 39 for the

compared to the quarter ended september 30 2019 reflects the decrease in rates paid for our interest bearing demand deposits the increase in the cost of deposits compared to the quarter ended december 31 2018 resulted from the increase in the volume and rates paid for time deposits during the year ended december 31 2018 the federal reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points which affected the rates that the bank offered on its time deposits in order to remain competitive in our markets and attract new deposits the federal reserve did not begin lowering rates until august 1 2019 the bank experienced significant time deposit growth at the higher rates which contributed to the increase in the cost of time deposits paid in 2019 the overall costs of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2019 decreased four basis points to 1 69 compared to 1 73 for the quarter ended september 30 2019 and increased 19 basis points compared to 1 50 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the decrease in the cost of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended september 30 2019 resulted from both lower cost of deposits and short term borrowings the increase in the cost of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2018 is mainly a result of an increase in the cost of deposits but is also driven by the increased cost of borrowed funds including the subordinated debt issued in november 2019 used to finance loan and investment activity noninterest income noninterest income for the fourth and third quarters of 2019 totaled 1 6 million an increase of 0 8 million or 88 4 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in noninterest income compared to the quarter ended december 31

noninterest expense for the quarter ended december 31 2019 compared to the quarter ended september 30 2019 is mainly attributable to the 0 8 million increases in both acquisition expenses and other operating expenses during the quarter ended december 31 2019 1 0 million was recorded in acquisition expense primarily related to the bank of york acquisition the increase in other operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in bank shares taxes as well as other expenses resulting from the company s growth the increase in noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to the 1 5 million and 0 7 million increases in salaries and employee benefits and acquisition expenses respectively the increase in salaries and employee benefits is mainly attributable to the increase in the number of employees as a result of our growth with the acquisitions of mainland bank and bank of york which added five branch locations and related staff as well as the opening of two new branches in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company ended 2019 with 324 full time equivalent employees compared to 285 at december 31 2018 the

executive would receive and will provide life insurance medical dental and vision coverage until the earlier of executive s return to employment age 65 or death in the event that the disability benefit provisions of the employment agreement were triggered for one of the covered executives at september 30 2019 the executive would be entitled to cash disability benefits in an amount up to approximately 1 3 million 704 000 and 474 000 in the case of messrs olson muto and hangen respectively in the event the executive dies while employed by essa bancorp the executive s estate will be paid the executive s base salary for one year and the executive s family will be entitled to continuation of medical dental and vision benefits for one year after the executive s death in the event

cash payment in the amount of approximately 467 000 256 000 and 263 006 respectively long termincentive plan on december 13 2019 essa bank trust adopted the essa bank trust performance based long term incentive plan for executives and management ltip which provides for the grant of cash settled performance based awards the ltip does not represent an added component of executive and management compensation but rather a restructuring of a component that was previously administered through the 2016 equity incentive plan upon adoption of the ltip cash settled awards will no longer be granted under the 2016 equity incentive plan as in the past the compensation committee will annually determine the performance metrics and terms of the long term incentive awards awards are subject to the achievement of performance criteria over a one year performance period payable over four years and a participant must be employed as of the applicable payment date to receive a payment at each payment date awards are settled in cash and the awards under the ltip are subject to the company s clawback policy since the ltip was adopted after the fiscal year end of september 30 2019 awards granted under the ltip are not described in the compensation matters section in this proxy statement stock award and stock option program stockholders approved the essa bancorp inc 2016 equity incentive plan the 2016 equity plan on march 3 2016 under this plan individuals may receive awards of company common stock and grants of options to purchase company common stock the compensation committee believes that stock ownership provides a significant incentive in building stockholder value by further aligning the interests of our officers and employees with stockholders since such compensation is directly linked to the performance of the company s common stock in addition stock options and restricted stock awards granted to our named executive officers generally vest over a four year period with accelerated vesting in the event of death disability involuntary termination of employment other than for cause of service following a change in control thereby aiding retention assuming that accelerated vesting occurred as of september 30 2019 due to death disability or an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause following a change in control based on the closing price per share of company common stock on that date the value of a reasonable estimate of the awards made to the named executive officers for the fiscal year which ended on september 30 2019 would be as follows mr olson would receive 262 264 in value for accelerated restricted stock mr muto would receive 131 335 in value for accelerated restricted stock and mr hangen would receive 137 444 in value

we carve new paths for growth and efficiency work that will be both rewarding and challenging for our team in that regard we have recently partnered with a third party to assist us in identifying new revenue and efficiency opportunities designed to improve ongoing performance as well as the customer experience i ve asked kevin to serve as executive sponsor of this initiative and he ll provide more comments on this important work later in the presentation before i turn the call over to jamie i ll briefly walk us through the highlights of the fourth quarter noted on slide 3 diluted earnings per share were 0 97 or 0 94 adjusted adjusted eps was down 3 sequentially and up 3 1 year over year period end loan growth was 745 million or 8 1 annualized resulting from total funded loan production of 3 6 billion period end deposit growth was 972 million or 10 3 annualized core transaction deposits increased 373 million and total deposit cost declined 13 basis points from the prior quarter net interest margin was 3 65 a decline of 4 basis points from the prior quarter excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments the net interest margin was 3 40 down 2 basis points from the prior quarter non interest income was 98 million in the fourth quarter an increase of 9 2 million from the prior quarter and 30 million from the prior year quarter led by capital markets and fiduciary activities and credit quality metrics remain solid with the non performing loan ratio and the non performing asset ratio declining by 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 0 27 and 0 37 respectively the net charge off ratio was 0 10 we repurchased 36 5 million in common stock or 1 1 million shares during the quarter which completed our 2019 share repurchase authorization of 725 million outstanding shares were reduced 11 from the beginning of the year our 2020 share repurchase authorization should allow us to continue operating with the cet1 ratio around 9 i m also pleased to report that our board approved a 10 increase in the quarterly dividend to 0 33 per share of common stock effective with the april 1 dividend i ll now turn the call over to jamie for a more detailed look at 2019 andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer thank you kessel let s begin on slide 4 with loans we had another strong quarter of loan growth with a net increase of nearly 750 million on production of 3 6 billion the growth was broad based with cre growing in seven of ten asset class direct c i lending increasing across the footprint and the consumer book experiencing growth in all product types the credit profile of this growth was consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in the quality of our loan book we have a robust loan pipeline across industries and the footprint and we re starting to benefit more directly from changes in the competitive marketplace following recent m a activity and industry consolidation on slide 5 deposit highlights include a continued increase in core transaction deposits this is a direct reflection of our team member s performance growing quality relationships across our footprint in the fourth quarter we continued our efforts to remix the deposit book by allowing higher cost deposits to run off we offset that run off with growth in non interest bearing deposits money markets and the seasonal inflows for more reasonable priced public fund deposits this strategic focus support continued reductions in the total cost of deposits which fell 18 basis points from the peak in july and 13 basis points from the previous quarter as you can see on slide 6 the core net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 3 4 excluding purchase accounting accretion lower interest rates resulted in an 18 basis point reduction in loan yield and a 13 basis point reduction in the cost of deposits as a reminder gaap margin at 3 65 benefited from purchase accounting accretion which was 26 million in the fourth quarter the benefit to nii from purchase accounting will decline substantially in 2020 to a full year total of approximately 8 million strong balance sheet pipelines and the timing of loan growth which was weighted toward the end of the quarter provide tailwinds going into 2020 on slide 7 you will see we have had continued success in fee revenue growth which increased to 98 million or 92 million adjusted included in our gaap non interest income is an 8 million increase in the fair value of certain equity investments in the fourth quarter fee revenue growth was led by capital markets and fiduciary activities of 2 million and 1 million respectively which more than offset reductions in areas such as mortgage banking income non interest income as a percentage of average assets continues to improve as we successfully execute on this key strategic objective an example of this success includes a 29 year over year increase and implementations by treasury payment solutions slide 8 shows adjusted expenses of 265 million which is an increase of 6 million from the previous quarter significant increases noted on this slide reflect a 3 million increase in fdic expense associated with the reclassification of certain loan categories over the past four years expenses also increased with opportunistic revenue producing hires and additional non interest income there was also a 2 million increase in servicing expense that was more than offset with higher revenue resulted from a renegotiation of a third party consumer lending partnerships as we execute strategies from our new operating model we continue to recalibrate our expense base to emphasize the importance of customer facing talent and technology these investments have short term paybacks that will serve the company well by improving efficiency and profitability long term key credit quality metrics on slide 9 remains favorable including npl and npa ratio that each declined by 5 basis points these reductions were achieved with a net charge off ratio of 10 basis points for the quarter the net charge off rate was 16 basis points for the year provision expense of 24 5 million included the costs associated with a 466 million increase in net loan growth from the prior period provision expense remains elevated compared to net charge offs due to the impact of purchase accounting under our acquired loan accounting selection the credit mark flows through nii rather than provision as loans pay off or renew as we think about the overall allowance our coverage ratios remained favorable as credit quality continues to look healthy onto slide 10 we remain confident in our overall capital position and are pleased to report that we completed the 725 million share repurchase authorization in 2019 this included fourth quarter repurchase activity of 37 million which reflected a reduction of an additional 1 1 million shares total shares were reduced 11 from the beginning of the year ongoing analysis continues to provide support for operating at our current capital and liquidity ratios and now kevin will discuss our outlook kevin blair president and chief operating officer thanks jamie before i talk about what we expect in 2020 let me take a minute to reflect on 2019 i am very pleased with our progress and success achieved during the year as we rolled out a new operating model in the beginning of the year our objectives were to better align our organization to further enhance the customer experience as well as expand and diversify our sources of growth in 2019 we added 58 net new revenue producing team members across our foot print in many of the fastest growing markets in which we serve various business units contributed to our growth including mortgage brokerage trust private wealth management wholesale banking and treasury payment solutions the attraction of this talent helped move the needle in 2019 and will have an even bigger impact on 2020 we also experienced strong growth in banker productivity during the year with funded loan production of 11 1 billion up 3 billion or 37 from 2018 moreover the increase in production led to a 5 5 pro forma outstandings growth in total loans with c i cre and consumer asset classes all increasing in 2019 we also delivered 10 6 fee income growth versus 2018 on a pro forma synovus fcb basis strong growth was delivered across multiple businesses including mortgage capital markets card and our fiduciary and asset management businesses which saw assets under management grow 21 as we continue to expand our capabilities and presence across the footprint as a result of the growth in these categories we saw the percentage of our revenue derived from fee income increase throughout the year now totaling 19 in the fourth quarter as we previously discussed we completed the integration of the florida community bank during the year and we re pleased with the contributions of our newest team members the legacy fcb wholesale team continued on a path of growth with loans increasing 350 million during the year deposit accounts growing by 8 and record levels of capital market income of 18 million up 38 year over year credit in the acquired fcb book also performed as we expected during the year with credit metrics and internal reviews supporting the overall quality of the portfolio the legacy fcb branch network also saw performance gains in 2019 with branch unit sales per month of 51 slightly higher than the legacy synovus branches we also invested a new technology and new business units to generate growth we released mysynovus our consumer digital portal in 2019 and are preparing for the release of our commercial digital platform in 2020 in the middle of 2019 the synovus structured lending division was formed and in a very short period of time has already generated a 150 million in loan commitments we also spent the year building out and piloting a much stronger value proposition for the mass affluent customer segment and we ll release this program and the associated solutions across our franchise this quarter so as we enter 2020 our roadmap will follow a similar course it calls for opportunistic expansion and growth simplification and process enhancements that will make us even easier to do business with and additional efficiency efforts that will fund new investments while helping to mitigate the headwinds from the margin in building the strategic roadmap we engaged a third party back in september of 2019 the work over the last four months has informed our 2020 guidance but more importantly our long term goals we have reviewed over 20 initiatives that provide opportunities for incremental growth from the revenue side as well as additional efficiencies we are in the final stages of prioritizing the eight to ten initiatives that will be delivered during 2020 but generally the revenue opportunities have a longer term horizon while efficiency opportunities will begin to be realized in 2020 our efficiency opportunities will center around the categories that have been constructive for us in the past third party spend real estate and staffing rationalization as we move forward with this engagement we will continue to provide updates and greater transparency around the opportunities as well as the progress now moving to our 2020 guidance and long term targets these are based on a lower for longer rate environment and modest economic growth we believe that the economic tailwinds that have resulted in above average economic growth in the southeast will continue our clients maintain a favorable outlook on the business environment and we are focused on supporting their growth we are pleased with the positive momentum in the balance sheet growth which has been driven by new talent the enhancement of capabilities and sales tools as well as stronger growth in our larger tier 1 markets our approach and the momentum is expected to continue to support asset growth of 4 to 7 in 2020 funded loan production increased throughout 2019 and ended the year with a robust pipeline funded by a remix deposit base for 2020 we expect loan growth to exceed market economic growth as we further deepen existing relationships grow new relationships and continue hiring of frontline bankers we expect this to result in broad based loan growth across markets and industries we will fund this growth with a continued focus on growing core transaction deposits our efforts to reduce high cost deposits will continue in 2020 as we selectively reduce higher cost single service deposits one of the most significant headwinds to the 2020 income statement is purchase accounting adjustments which are expected to reduce revenues by approximately 90 million from 2019 excluding paa adjusted net interest income should increase 0 to 3 as we continue to actively manage our balance sheet to optimize the margin as well as returns we do expect the net interest margin to be down slightly assuming flat interest rates and similar balance sheet mix adjusted non interest income is expected to increase 3 to 6 with broad based growth the continued growth in fee income is a function of hiring efforts and higher opportunity markets product areas such as treasury payment solutions as well as an expansion of the share of wallet with existing relationships adjusted non interest expense is expected to increase 3 to 5 the primary drivers include continued investments in people processes and technology that will have relative short term paybacks these investments will be partially offset by savings realized during the execution of our strategic efficiency initiatives the 2019 tax rate of 26 was negatively impacted by significant non deductible merger related expenses that are not expected in 2020 as well as certain discrete items that were also negative elimination of these aforementioned expenses as well as additional strategic tax initiatives and the realignment of certain subsidiaries will reduce the future effective tax rate substantially we expect the net charge off ratio of 15 basis points to 25 basis points as the credit cycle matures and recovery subside there are no indications of any widespread credit deterioration however net charge offs will be impacted by changes resulting from purchase accounting of the acquired portfolio as the credit mark is unwound at cecl adoption as we look forward to 2020 the largest change to financial statements involve ccel implementation provision expense will be elevated going forward as we provide for life of loan losses and will be highly dependent on the projected economic environment the credit profile and tenure of loans the impact of unfunded reserves as well as expectations about net loan growth and a continuation of the current elevated levels of payoffs given our current profile of loan growth and expectations for the economy we anticipate adding up to 10 basis point to the allowance for credit losses ratio throughout 2020 to account for the change in provisioning to the life of loans our estimated day one cecl impact which remains unchanged from the previous quarter can be found in the appendix this incremental forecasted provision expense is not related to any changes in the underlying credit fundamentals of our loan book moving on to capital in 2019 we completed subordinated debt and preferred stock issuances and purchased 20 million shares which effectively optimized the capital stack given the current balance sheet size and risk profile we reiterated our comfort with a cet1 ratio of 9 under the current conditions and are committed to first funding organic growth second maintaining a competitive dividend and third effective capital deployment as such we will be increasing the common dividend by 10 in 2020 targeting a payout ratio of 35 to 40 moreover we will monitor capital consumption through organic loan growth and tailor our share repurchases accordingly as we continuously manage our capital and liquidity positions our long term goals reflect the successful execution of our strategic roadmap we are committed to aggressively identify and implement new avenues for growth and efficiencies throughout our organization i am confident in our path forward in the passion and the commitment of our entire team and in the clarity of our vision to be the bank we ve always been but better we ve moved we re moving forward fully aligned with a keen eye on delivering on our goals of positive operating leverage diversified balance sheet growth and top quartile profitability metrics kessel i ll turn it back over to you for closing remarks kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thank you kevin and before we move to q a i again want to thank our synovus team for their contributions to another successful year for our company our results reflect continued momentum across our footprint with greater organic growth and an improving ability to execute well as a fully unified team i m always so proud of the way our team supports each other serves our customers and gives back to our communities operator we are now available for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and the first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst i guess just first question wanted to looking at the expense guidance of 3 to 5 how should we think about expense growth for the year is the lower end kind of tied to if revenue asset growth is at the lower end we should expect expenses to be at the lower end and is that the right way to think about where expenses could shake out or is it more incumbent on just investment decisions that you re making would love to get your thoughts in terms of just how we think about operating leverage for the year and also in terms of do we expect to get an update on the efficiency plan by the first quarter earnings or do you expect an update sooner than that andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer so ebrahim hi this is jamie thanks for the question we expect as we say 3 to 5 expense growth for 2020 and a lot of that has to do with things that happened in 2019 so we have about 1 expense growth associated with the third party servicing and so that s just growth in the book that s a renegotiation that also negatively impacted expenses this quarter other thing another impact are hires we made in the second half of 19 and so we ve been really growing our first line out there in the field and that s going to be a negative impact to expenses as we head into 2020 you re right the growth would definitely impact that you saw that in the second half of 19 when with the commission expense being higher just because of the strong performance in the fee revenue businesses and so you re right it is somewhat dependent on that but we are excited about the opportunity to improve this and we have many initiatives in play as kevin mentioned on the script talking about our opportunities for 2020 with our transformation efforts kevin blair president and chief operating officer and ebrahim this is kevin i ll add through to the question as it relates to additional transparency around the initiatives yeah i think in the first quarter earnings call we ll provide a little more clarity as to the initiatives themselves obviously when we are giving guidance on the full year we want to understand what the third party spend will be in order to generate the savings but as jamie mentioned i think what you ll see with our quarterly expenses is that we ll hit a high watermark in first quarter and then expenses will trail off as the year continues and so we ll be able to generate positive operating leverage as we get toward the second half of the year and most certainly as we look at 2021 ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful and just moving quickly to capital cet1 at 8 95 relative to the 9 target and you obviously raised the dividend this morning is it safe to assume that we should we may not see any buybacks at least early part of the year as you sort of gauge asset growth given you guidance and let capital build like what s the right way to think about buybacks from here on andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah ebrahim we expect to maintain cet1 around the 9 level where we are currently and we feel confident in that level and so you re right we ll be looking at how we grow our balance sheet and how that plays into capital ratios but i wouldn t assume that that means there will be holding off on share repurchases ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst so we could or we should expect a share repurchase in the first quarter andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer we are not giving guidance to the timing of share repurchases but we re going to stay at the 9 level as you look at that i would say with our forecast of loan growth and the guidance we re giving we may repurchase 2 million to 3 million shares in 2020 and that will probably be over the course of the year ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks for taking my questions kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thank you ebrahim operator thank you and the next question comes from tyler stafford with stephens tyler stafford stephens inc analyst hey good morning guys kevin blair president and chief operating officer hey tyler kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning tyler tyler stafford stephens inc analyst hey i guess jamie i m trying to just triangulate on expenses here there is a comment from last quarter s call about looking at opportunities not just in the fourth quarter but in the 2021 2020 and 2021 to take out significant adjustments to the expense run rate relative to the fourth quarter expenses that we saw that stepped up fairly meaningfully and then i think the guide of 3 to 5 that was above expectations just i guess simply what happened to the outlook that i thought you guys were talking about on the third quarter call relative to what happened in the fourth quarter and the outlook here of 3 to 5 expense growth andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer yes tyler well i d say a few things first we did have a lot of strong growth in the fourth quarter you saw the balance sheet growth your saw the fee revenue growth and so that contributed to our target expenses we also had the renegotiation of the third party relationship that added 2 million to fourth quarter expenses it will add as i mentioned a minute ago to ebrahim it will add another 10 million or so to 2020 expenses as well but just as a reminder that s offset by a bigger impact in nii and so it s accretive to the shareholder also in the fourth quarter we had fdic expense and that was related to the reclassification of certain loan categories over the past four years and when we went in and looked at that we also engaged a third party to identify opportunities to reduce the assessment rate going forward and so that will actually be a net positive to 2020 but then we also had higher compensation expense there were some ebbs and flows in compensation expense but we did have 2 million higher due to certain legacy defined benefit plans that hit us in the fourth quarter we do feel confident about the efforts we re making to reduce efficiency rate going forward you know as kevin mentioned we expect the first quarter to actually be a little higher due to seasonal impact of personnel expense that probably is 5 million to 6 million but we re excited about the work streams we have in play to help us improve our run rate going forward and help get back to positive operating leverage and we re targeting returning to year on year positive operating leverage in late 2020 tyler stafford stephens inc analyst okay but to be clear the efficiency opportunities that you re speaking to that is already reflected in the 3 to 5 expense growth outlook is that right andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer so the 3 to 5 outlook there are a couple of things with that one that doesn t include any expenses associated with the transformation effort so i ll be clear on that but the benefit to calendar year 2020 is not nearly as much as the benefit to run rate at the end of the year we expect to complete many of these initiatives that will improve both revenue and expense going forward but the impact to 2020 is not significant tyler stafford stephens inc analyst okay so the exit expense base being i think what you re implying at the low point for the year that lower expense exit base should continue into 2021 providing greater efficiencies really in 2021 and a lower expense growth rate kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer that s right and tyler this is kessel let me just kind of maybe summarize what both jamie and kevin said to the question of what happened because one of you on the call have already seen that question and emailed this morning early nothing really happened what in fact has happened is that the investments we made in 2019 throughout the year but a lot in the middle and back half of the year have really paid off but those salaries and those investments didn t go away as we entered 2020 but in the midst of all that we ve been very thoughtful and quite frankly aggressive in taking out cost in the back half either in the fourth quarter with some reductions in staff throughout our company so i don t want to leave you with the impression that we ve forgotten about our commitment to expense control it s just on this call today and i think you know this about us or me i don t like to guide to things that i don t see and so we are working very aggressively with a third party so that we can give you more color as to the amount of revenue opportunity and the amount of expense run rate short term and long term and so i just want to make sure that you understand the commitment to executing on that is as strong as ever tyler stafford stephens inc analyst okay thank you kessel kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thanks tyler operator and the next question comes from brady gailey with kbw brady gailey keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey thanks good morning guys kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer hey brady brady gailey keefe bruyette woods inc analyst well i think i heard something earlier in the call about the loan loss reserve ratio being built 10 basis points i wasn t sure does that is that somehow related to ccel or are you referring to after ccel you expect to build the reserve by 10 basis points throughout the rest of 2020 andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer hey brady this is jamie that we are referring to ccel and we re referring to the day two impact on the allowance for credit losses as we look at 2020 and to give guidance there ccel was impacted by multiple factors right like there is the impact of loan growth there is an impact of the credit components of loan mix there is an impact of prepayments if you have accelerated prepayments the average duration of your book extends and it negatively impacts your provision expense due to ccel there is the impact of unfunded commitments as well as the big impact of the general economic environment your assumptions that you put in there and so when we look forward on the day two impact of ccel we expect our allowance for credit losses to marginally increase as we go through the year clearly there s a lot of uncertainty we re not forecasting any deterioration in the economy we think that using a flat kind of economic assumptions that we still may see a slight increase in the allowance percentage or the percent of loans just due to the fact that the average duration of the book extends a little bit there is no change in the credit performance we the forward looking credit indicators are all looking very good and strong right now it s really just an impact of just forecasting slightly longer duration within the different portfolios brady gailey keefe bruyette woods inc analyst alright that s helpful and then kessel it s been a year since you closed fcb your currency has come back a little bit at least relative to where it was at some points back in 2019 any update on how you re thinking about m a in the next year or two kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer well year or two might be two different things brady i mean currency has come back some but not enough to i think position us to participate in the transactions right now as i think you probably know there is a lot of chatter out there there are a lot of smaller banks looking for exit partners i think we would all agree there are lot more sellers than there are buyers right now but we re very very very focused on our internal operations on organic growth on improving our returns on controlling the expense growth that tyler and ebrahim both just spoke to so i think short term the answer is hedge down internal focus keep building on the reputation that i think we ve established keep proving the investment thesis all in fcb as that team has really become fully integrated into our team and performing well throughout the entire state of florida so late this year 2021 i would just say that regardless of currency we will be very disciplined and again the thought being that if they were the right opportunity where we had the right currency i think we would have to certainly look at something but i wouldn t anticipate that being a 2020 event and would see 2021 i believe there will be plenty of sellers in 2021 as well brady gailey keefe bruyette woods inc analyst got it thanks guys kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from jennifer demba with suntrust jennifer demba suntrust robinson humphreys inc analyst thank you good morning kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning jennifer jennifer demba suntrust robinson humphreys inc analyst back to the expenses topic jamie i think you said that you expect the expense rationalization efforts to take to be more weighted toward the back end of the year does that bias your guidance for expenses core expenses of 3 to 5 3 to 5 growth does that bias it toward the low end of that guidance andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer jennifer i think that our guidance is i mean there are scenarios that can get within get you to the low end or the high end but you know we think that that s the right range we think our base cases is right in the middle of the range but there are definitely opportunities to be at the low end and as kessel mentioned earlier we re going to be looking at a lot of things that can move the lever faster we ve as kevin mentioned on the call we ve looked at over 20 initiatives there are things that are teed up to go and in process right now and so i guess that guidance is the best i can give you right now but we feel good about it jennifer demba suntrust robinson humphreys inc analyst okay and question on hires or how offensive will you be in 2020 on hiring off this 58 base last year kevin blair president and chief operating officer well jennifer i think that really covers that expense number as well because we have not backed off on the hiring front and again i believe selfishly we ve got a pretty attractive platform to hire too i mean we continue to add depth throughout our footprint and really all of our higher growth markets it will continue to be i actually spoke earlier this morning to allen barker who is our atlanta market president about the number of people that he and some of our other leaders here continue to talk to and as he said to me we have the opportunity to be very selective on who we hire because of the number of people who are interested in joining our team so i think we ll continue to be aggressive that puts pressure on that revenue number but while there is some disruption while there are good bankers in the market we certainly want to make sure that we are front and center in that decision i ve visited with kevin howard in atlanta just a couple of weeks ago and we spoke with a couple of people he s recruiting and again just seeing what attracts them to our company made me feel really good so we ll be aggressive but again disciplined i mean hiring comes with a cost because especially in the middle market space it takes for take a while to generate revenue to cover that so we ll make sure we balance the hiring in terms of what can give us shorter term payback versus longer term payback but i would say again the if you d look at the last quarter growth in loans and the push in fee revenue it really does reflect a success of our hiring decisions throughout 2019 jennifer demba suntrust robinson humphreys inc analyst okay thank you kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thanks jennifer operator thank you and the next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons with d a davidson kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst hey good morning everyone kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning kevin kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst just taking a step back a bit on the you said you engaged a third party back in september i m just curious what the thought process was was it that you knew you had all these investments being made and you needed a way or wanted a way wanted to look at a way to offset that or was it more about looking versus peers where you stood on certain ratios i m just curious the thought process before stepping in with that kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer yeah we ll all take some of that kevin but i just think a fresh look is always good you know us as well as anybody on this call and in the past we ve engaged a third party for major initiatives i remember like yesterday 2011 when it was a 100 million then we did a 35 or 25 and as we have grown as we have integrated another organization as we have made major investments and i don t want to not give credit to our team who have been very diligent in looking at ways we can take cost out we thought it was a good it s been a while since we had a really third party fresh look at everything we doing how we re pricing our products what products we are offering procurement i mean jamie and kevin have been to the work stream so it was a combination of just time and a fresh look it gives you ideas that maybe you didn t recognize or at least raises the opportunity of that and we ve been very pleased so far we just got a little more work to do andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer and kevin let me add to that to kessel s point we were not looking at our current efficiency ratio which if you look at for 2019 at 52 and felt that we were an outlier quite frankly i think we still show very well relative to our peers as it relates to efficiency ratio but to kessel s point we re on offence and we re trying to grow the bank and we knew that if we needed to find capacity to continue to invest in new talent and technology that we had to be more efficient but in addition to the efficiency initiatives we have a lot of revenue initiatives we re talking about and most importantly we re also looking at process reengineering and automation that s going to not only make our team member s lives better but also make us easier to do business with with our customers so for us it s not parochially focused on just efficiency we re looking at growth we re looking at generating revenue and we re looking at becoming a better institution as we serve our customers and as kessel mentioned earlier we re a great platform for teammates or for team members to come to today and we want to continue to get better there as well kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst okay great and one quick follow up just on the margin on core excluding purchase accounting over the course of the year i know you mentioned what it would be roughly but over when we re looking in a forward quarters would you expect it to see some more compression but then stabilization at some point mid year how should we expect it to flow kevin blair president and chief operating officer yeah kevin you nailed it that s exactly what we would expect i d just say the fourth quarter looking at the core margin at 3 40 we feel really good about that and it benefited from a couple of things one is the investment portfolio repositioning and so that will continue to benefit us and second is our third party relationships as well as the renegotiation of those that will also benefit us as we head into 2020 so we have that tailwind that got us to the 3 40 but as we look at 2020 i would say that i would expect we guide for the full year slightly down i would just say expect most of that in the first quarter there are three things driving that one is we had just such strong loan growth in the fourth quarter the second thing is that the first quarter has strong loan growth already quarter to date and the third thing is just that the fed move was at the end of october and so we didn t get a full quarter of that rate reduction and so i would say slightly down for the year biased toward the first quarter kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst great thanks guys andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer thank you kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thanks kevin operator thank you and next we have john pancari with evercore isi john pancari evercore isi analyst good morning kevin blair president and chief operating officer good morning john kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning john john pancari evercore isi analyst on the expense topic again just given the initiatives and the longer term expected benefits and everything where do you see the impact being to your efficiency ratio longer term what do you think is the appropriate long term level for your efficiency ratio once you dial these efforts in thanks kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer john that s a great question we are striving for an efficiency ratio in the low 50s i mean we ve talked before about that at the 50 area but we re really shooting for low 50s given the change in the underlying interest rate environment but look we think we can improve we think with our business mix we have opportunities to be better and be more efficient on how we go to market as kevin mentioned we think that s going to improve the experience for our associates and our customers and so we re excited about that and we believe that these initiatives will help us get there john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it thanks and then separately on your guidance on the 4 to 7 asset growth how does that break down by the components in terms of loan growth securities and then maybe give us some color on the other side on deposits kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer yeah we as we look at 2020 we re not really forecasting any material change in the investment portfolio you mentioned security so if you look at our loan to deposit ratio we re comfortable where we are with our liquidity profile and so i wouldn t expect that to change and just i mean so i would expect to see balanced growth from us on both loans and deposits john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it got it thanks and then lastly on the credit side the your delinquencies looked like they jumped about 40 linked quarter can you give us some color on what drove that and then separately do you have criticized and classified assets for the quarter and how that changed robert warren derrick executive vice president chief credit officer yeah hey john this is bob i ll try to provide you with a little color on that we did have one large c i credit that carried to quarter end it s in our normal collection process so given the fact that those past due levels are so low when you have one it can move the needle up from a percentage standpoint if you call it out from an ongoing basis we still see risk grade inflow excuse me risk grade new and renewed origination to being at or better than our current levels we still got inflows that are minimal relatively speaking and our past dues while there will be some fluctuation obviously quarter to quarter when you get to these low levels they re still showing no real signs of overall credit deterioration your comment about the rated book john is you re going to have some credits move within substandard or special mention here and there throughout the quarter but again there is no real new names coming onto that list so it s just normal course of business there kevin blair president and chief operating officer and john this is kevin i ll just add to bob s comments as kessel mentioned we had roughly 3 6 billion in production during the fourth quarter that was up 20 over the third quarter and you heard bob mention the average risk weighting when we look at not only the book and you look at the low levels of npas and delinquencies that we have in our portfolio we have a keen eye on making sure that the new production that s coming on is consistent with that prudent growth strategy and to see that each quarter we have an improving risk profile as it relates to that weighted average risk rating gives us great confidence that we expect to see similar credit quality into the coming quarters and as bob mentioned you re going to have some episodic ebbs and flows in those numbers just because they re so small but there is nothing that concerns us either from a portfolio or from what we re seeing on the production side john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it and then and sorry did you imply that the would you state that the criticized or classified assets were stable in the quarter kevin blair president and chief operating officer yes john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it alright thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from michael rose with raymond james michael rose raymond james associates inc analyst hey guys so it sounds like mid hey how are you sounds like mid single digit loan growth is kind of what you guys are targeting you guys had really strong c i loan growth this quarter especially relative to the industry can you talk about just some of the growth drivers as we think about growth into 2020 is it are you guys moving upstream at all are the new hires that you ve made which i think are more weighted toward wealth management in 2019 but is it some of the new hires is it market share takeaway just give us some color as to how we should think about growth next year thanks kevin blair president and chief operating officer no michael it s great question yeah fourth quarter was a strong c i quarter but i look at the year and i look at almost 800 million worth of c i growth and ironically it was not in the owner occupied real estate category we see a tremendous amount of competition from some of our competitors that are offering long term fixed rate owner occupied mortgages and quite frankly based on our profitability requirements we ve let some of that leave us so where we re seeing growth on the c i front is really in our wholesale bank and we have added individuals there we re up 10 revenue producers in the wholesale bank this year the growth is coming from across our footprint in florida and alabama and georgia and south carolina i think as you recall we moved kevin howard to lead that group and it s been a change that has continued to build momentum as the year has progressed and they put on a really strong fourth quarter and it s not in any one industry it s across many different industries we re seeing it both on the line of credit side and unfunded commitments that was still growing at a commensurate rate but also on the funded debt that s coming on so we re optimistic that that will continue not just from taking share from competitors but from the continued growth that we have from the bankers that kessel mentioned we brought on in the second half of the year and we ve also brought on the structured lending division which is a new business for us that saw growth in the third and fourth quarter and we re very optimistic that that will continue into 2020 and into 2021 the good news is when you look at what we re doing we re getting a tremendous amount of growth not only on the loan side but the really nice data point is that we re getting treasury and operating accounts with a lot of those customers and we ve talked a lot about our upgrade in treasury payments solutions but when you look at the number of implementations that we had in 2019 versus 2018 we re up 30 so that means we re putting 30 more solutions in the hands of our customers so we re very optimistic to see that growth continue but we re most excited about the new relationships that we re able to garner michael rose raymond james associates inc analyst okay so that kind of dovetails with the comments around kind of balance deposit growth as well it seems like you ll be getting some traction on the dda side which you got this quarter but seems like that will continue into next year correct kevin blair president and chief operating officer yeah so average dda was up for the quarter when you look at the number of accounts we grew on the consumer checking account front as well so that was exciting to see and we re starting to get greater traction as it relates to operating accounts for some of these commercial relationships and that s going to be a big area of focus for us in 2020 to make sure that we get commercial deposit growth obviously that s a very sticky deposit and it s one that comes on the lower end of the call spectrum as well so that will be something that we re very focused on and we re adding new treasury resources every day to make sure that we cover that market michael rose raymond james associates inc analyst alright very helpful maybe just one follow up question i m going to go back to expenses can you just give a little bit more color on the third party that you ve engaged maybe who it is and then you know that line item has been around 20 million should we expect that to kind of grow as we move into next year as you kind of work through some of these efforts thanks andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah this is jamie we have been working with boston consulting group and they have been diving into many of our businesses and our products and you re right we will see expenses associated with those as we go through 2020 and we will be clear about the impact of those to nie as we go forward michael rose raymond james associates inc analyst alright thanks for taking my questions operator thank you and the next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst great thanks i ll try not ask another question about expenses i figure you ve given enough brief about that for the rest of the day kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thank you ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst but let s talk about the payback i guess from those expenses so like when you think about like i get that you hired a bunch of people and i see why you re growing assets this quarter or sorry in 2020 the 4 to 7 and you got 3 to 6 fee growth my question is like once those people and all these initiatives are done and up and running does that imply that asset growth should be higher than the 4 to 7 and fee growth should be higher than the 3 to 6 like not this year but into 2021 kevin blair president and chief operating officer i ll take that ken so it s obviously each position that we hire we have a calculated roi npv and payback period so as kessel mentioned earlier we know that our middle market bankers typically are less than eight months in terms of a payback and when you go to some of the wealth positions it takes a year or so for those earn backs but yes we look at those trailing revenue benefits and over time you ll pick up some of the operating leverage for these new positions because the expense will stay flat and the revenue continues to grow so all else held constant on those positions yes the revenue increases while the expenses stay flat when you think about the 2020 guidance for next year and what we did this year we were up 10 6 in fee income this year that was aided by our new hires if you look at some of those businesses that we added resources this year you ll see another 10 growth next year in those same businesses we just have some anchors as it relates to fee income on a year over year basis that s why you see a mid single digit number for businesses like mortgage where seasonally it will be a little lower based on where we see interest rates capital markets where this year we had a record year so it s hard to continue to grow that at 10 but those businesses that we ve invested in will continue to grow at a double digit pace and over time will become more efficient ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got it okay that helps and then i guess the other question just in terms of provision expense i completely understand that cecl is going to drive greater volatility in your provision expense but you did mention it was going to be elevated is it right to think about if you are adding say 10 basis points or about 15 to your reserve ratio your allowance that your provision expense should also be call it roughly 15 higher all things equal of course so instead of the 24 you did this quarter it would be something like 28 i mean is that the right logic to think about going forward kevin blair president and chief operating officer i think the right way to think about it going forward would be just to put an expansion of the allowance for credit losses to the year ending loan balance and see what the provision build would be required to get there and the allowance build yeah it s a little bit different answer than what you re saying ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst it is oh ok i guess i ll have to think about that a little bit more but ok i m good thank you very much kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thanks ken operator thank you and now online we have brad milsaps with piper sandler brad milsaps piper sandler co analyst hey good morning kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning brad brad milsaps piper sandler co analyst just wanted to follow up on ken s cecl questions if my math is right looks like you might be targeting a reserve around 120 by the end of the by the end of the year if that s in fact correct did that also account for any payoffs you get on the acquired book you know some of that discount accreting back through the provision does that also take into account for that or is that pretty much where you think you end up no matter what andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer we still feel confident that day one impact of the 40 to 60 and then we expect some slight expansion in the allowance over the course of the year as you re well aware the purchase accounting impact gets wrapped up into ccel in 2020 brad milsaps piper sandler co analyst okay and then secondly just sticking with accretion income on the deposit side i think you had the 11 million mark come through again this quarter my understanding is that obviously goes away this year how quickly do you think you can sort of earn that back so to speak through reductions in funding costs you had a nice reduction this quarter in interest bearing deposit costs of around 15 basis points or so do you think it takes you a couple of quarters to sort of recapture that 11 million so to speak or is it longer than that kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer yeah ken you re right the benefit of paa on the policy goes away at year end and we expect some opportunity in deposit repricing in the first quarter and so we expect to see some decline there but the benefit of remixing is largely complete for us brad milsaps piper sandler co analyst okay great thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jp morgan steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst hey good morning everybody kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning steve steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst i want to first go back to your response to ebrahim s question do you plan to manage full year expenses to the revenue outcome and deliver positive operating leverage in 2020 on a full year basis andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer no we have revenue so revenue headwinds include the paa impact that kevin mentioned 90 million so we expect nii just to be marginally up on the year we had 0 to 3 and then we have strong growth in fee revenue and you see our guidance and so that does not lead to positive operating leverage for the full year steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay that s clear thank you and then on the loan growth so when i look at florida community they were routinely doing 400 million to 500 million per quarter of growth before the sale and i think you said you did 350 million loan growth in total from them in 2019 why did their loan growth fall by so much andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer it s a great question steven so it was less about production when you go back and look at what they would have produced in 2018 and you compare it to their funded production in 2019 it was only off by a couple of hundred million dollars so what we were pleased to see is that the level of production continued what changed was the level of pay offs and pay downs and it had very little to do with customer attrition it had to do with the maturation of the portfolio and the fact that they actually are seeing the type of churn that you would see in a portfolio as it matures as you recall they were producing somewhere around 400 million to 500 million worth of funded growth every quarter and they were growing 350 million to 400 million so there wasn t a lot of pay offs and pay downs as the maturity of their book has continued to increase they re starting to see some of that churn so that s really the difference steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay so you re saying the originations have remained consistent andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer very consistent and very strong and if you look at what they did in the fourth quarter it was a very high watermark for them it was a very very strong quarter for the legacy fcb team steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst got you okay thanks for all the color operator thank you and next is jared shaw with wells fargo securities andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer hi jared kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer hey jared jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst hi thank you just circling back on the provision i guess can you give a little color on what drove the i m sorry the allowance the allowance build this quarter given the sort of backdrop of stable credit quality kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer yeah we have spoken about this a little bit before but it s really it has to do with two things first is just about loan growth in aggregate and second is the high level of paydowns kevin mentioned the strong production in the fourth quarter but we also still see elevated pay downs and when we have pay downs in the book in the fcb book we don t get the benefit of a provision or a release and so even though we had loan growth of 800 million if you were to say what was the net loan growth of loans that we have provision against it d be much higher where we did not have provisioning and so that s what leads to that increase so basically we have normal loan growth and then we have the growth or the pay offs of ones where we did not have a provision against them and then they re offsetting our renewed and new loans jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful thanks and then just looking at the nii i heard obviously hear your comments on the margin but when you look at nii and the strong momentum you said going into first quarter as well as the incremental benefit from that third party servicing renegotiation should we expect actually quarterly to see nii may be stronger in the first quarter and then trickling down or i guess how should we be looking at nii through the year andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah you know let me just speak to it in rate terms you know we expect in the first quarter to see more of the impact of the negative more of a negative impact on loan yields and so we ll see we re expecting a decline in 2020 of somewhere between 10 basis points and 15 basis points in loan yield for the year but most of that will happen in the first quarter or a decent percentage will happen in the first quarter and again it s that same impact that i talked about about both the recent loan growth as well as the october rate move and the full quarter impact of that jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst hey thanks just a quick one on the fee income guidance for the year what does it take to get to the upper end of the range and are there scenarios that that could actually be greater kevin blair president and chief operating officer so for us it s some of it will do will have to do with the external market in terms of interest rates and what happens with the equity markets those are the variables that we look at we ve obviously had a lot of resources on the fiduciary and brokerage side so as the market flows we ll be able to ebb and flow within that range also with mortgage if you look at most of our business as i d mentioned we expect to see strong growth in service charges year over year based on our investments in treasury we expect to see double digit growth in our fiduciary business again the two businesses that represent a bit of a headwind for us as i mentioned were mortgage and capital markets for different reasons mortgage because of interest rates and capital markets just because of the elevated levels that we had this year so our success in moving to the high end of the range we ll have some of those external factors but quite frankly it will deal with our productivity internally and how we can continue to generate higher levels of production within those businesses christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst got it thanks very much kevin and thanks for all the discussion on the expenses this morning i appreciate it kevin blair president and chief operating officer thanks chris kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer thanks chris operator thank you and next on line is garrett holland with baird garrett holland robert w baird co analyst thanks and good morning just had a quick follow up for you i heard you on the efficiency ratio targeting low 50s but could you provide some more detail on the updated top quartile profitability metrics you re targeting in this type of interest rate environment and what s a realistic timeframe for getting there andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer yeah we are we look at roa roatce and efficiency ratio as we think about how do we perform versus peers and you know we believe in our strategies we believe in the work we re doing this year on these transformation efforts to get to to get back to the top quartile and so we think that we have a lot of momentum and a lot of opportunity here to improve that performance we re not ready to give guidance on you really our forecast longer term where we shake out on that but we will have more on that in the future kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer but garrett just in terms of timeframe we look at long term targets of two to three years i think you go out past that it s harder to forecast and to jaime s point the variable there that has made the industry change their expectations is just what interest rates are going to do and it s hard to forecast that out two to three years but our commitment is just to be in the high in the top quartile among our peer set garrett holland robert w baird co analyst that s helpful i appreciate the detail operator thank you and next we have steven duong with rbc capital steven duong rbc capital analyst hey good morning guys kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer good morning andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer good morning steven steven duong rbc capital analyst just on you mentioned the competition in the owner occupied portfolio was that the same tale on the multifamily side and what other segments are you seeing a high level of competition andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer well look there is not a single asset class that we serve that doesn t have competition steven so it s across the board now the owner occupied there are a lot of smaller banks doing rate promotions where they are offering longer tenure lower fixed rate loans and again within our business model we re not going to chase business that doesn t make sense for us financially so we re going to let some of that business leave us if it doesn t have the minimum profitability hurdle so i think that s what you re seeing in some of the owner occupied side on the multifamily i think that s much more of just the stabilization of properties that are moving off balance sheet there is a higher level of construction there and so as those reach maturity and move to the permanent market they re leaving our balance sheet but we re still producing on multifamily and like all the other asset classes we re winning our fair share it s just it s going to ebb and flow based on some of the maturation that are in our book steven duong rbc capital analyst got it appreciate the color on that and then just last one can you just remind us how much in your cd book you re expecting to have reprice for the quarter and what s the rate on that andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer so right now we would look at the maturities in the first quarter of the year somewhere around 800 million in cds the current portfolio was a little over 2 if you go back and look at this quarter all of the maturities were at 2 06 and we repriced at 1 98 so i think based on a flat rate environment you would see a similar movement in the first quarter with the maturities being a little over 2 and where we re renewing and where we re booking them in the high 1 90 s steven duong rbc capital analyst got it appreciate it thank you operator thank you and that does conclude the question and answer session so i would like to return the floor to kessel stelling for any closing remarks kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer alright well thank you operator and first thank you to all of you who participated on the call today we appreciate your interest in our company certainly some of the questions today might require follow up and as usual our team is available throughout the day and certainly next week to give you any follow up data points if we weren t clear today for those of you who are shareholders on the call thanks for your continued investment in our company but i really want to conclude by thanking our synovus team for the great year in 2019 for the way they really did finish the year so strong and for the energy they re already pouring into 2020 to find ways to generate new revenue additional efficiency and really deliver a differentiated customer experience all with the eye on creating long term shareholder value so a big thank you to the team the executive team looks forward to giving you more color and more updates on our transformation efforts no later than the next earnings call but if possible toward the end of the quarter in the appropriate public forum we would do that as well so thank you so much for your attention today hope you all have a great weekend and we look forward to talking with you soon operator duration 69 minutes call participants kevin brown senior director investor relations kessel d stelling jr chairman chief executive officer

year fourth quarter the current quarter interest expense of 8 8 million decreased 2 1 million or 19 percent over the prior quarter and decreased 603 thousand or 6 percent over prior year fourth

completed our first ever sales of the sba 7 a loans additionally while seasonally slower when compared with the prior quarter our direct to consumer mortgage business was again strong in the fourth quarter reflecting the positive impact of investments we made earlier in the year to improve both the customer experience and the workflow efficiency in the mortgage origination process our balance sheet management strategy is not only strengthened our earnings for the quarter but also allowed us to build capital as the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased from 7 1 to 7 33 furthermore our tangible book value per share increased 3 4 quarter over quarter to 30 82 and was up 10 3 for the year from a lending perspective our teams remained active and engaged while overall loan balances only increased 247 million or 9 for the year our teams actually produced over 900 million of funded originations and commitments our single tenant leasing lease financing public finance and healthcare finance businesses remain our largest commercial lines and add combined production of over 550 million for the year we are also very active on the consumer side of our business our specialty lines of horse trailer and rv lending led the way with 82 million of combined production and our direct to consumer mortgage business originated an additional 645 million of mortgage loans that were sold in the secondary market we grew our nationwide branchless deposit franchise by over 480 million in 2019 which included 258 million of growth in our money market accounts in particular our efforts to bring in more small business money market and checking accounts were extremely successful and contributed to over 190 million of the annual growth and the deposit balances the combination of the shift toward money market balances and aggressive downward repricing of cds allowed us to better manage deposit costs in the second half of the year this is a trend that we expected to continue throughout 2020 let me shift gears for a moment and provide an update on our sba business we continue to make progress with our expansion into small business banking with attractive opportunities on both sides of our balance sheet this is a meaningful and long term element of our strategy we brought on an experienced professionals during the year to begin building the foundation of our platform and we appointed new sales leadership to head up our expanding national sba program with ambitious plans to further build out our presence in 2020 we completed our acquisition of the small business lending division of first colorado national bank in november and doing so we picked up a 35 million portfolio of loans and a servicing portfolio of approximately 100 million we also gained a talented team of professionals in the areas of credit portfolio management and servicing that will help us accelerate our growth in small business lending the pipeline of new lending opportunities continues to grow and our efforts on the deposit side are producing positive results we believe that we can differentiate ourselves with a full suite of products and a consistently high level of service that emerging entrepreneurs need and that many larger banks do not prioritize importantly as we grow our asset quality remains exceptional it is among the best in the industry and is driven not only by our strong credit culture and disciplined approach to underwriting but also by our focus on certain specialty lending lines that target lower risk asset classes such as our public finance and our single tenant lease financing business looking at on the year ahead we are laser focused on improving financial returns we will do this by continuing to execute on the initiatives that we successfully implemented in 2019 building our capital base is a priority for us and we intend to drive this through improved profitability and disciplined balance sheet management while our overall balance sheet growth for 2020 may be modest especially by our standards we still expect strong loan production from our lines of business but we ll continue to execute loan sales to manage capital supplement non interest income and improve overall portfolio yields these strategies combined with disciplined loan pricing and the strong downward trend in deposit pricing are expected to produce net interest expansion during the year 2020 we also continue to invest in forward looking technologies to further enhance our digital focused approach for example following the demonstrated success in our mortgage business we are moving on to commercial and small business lending to implement new solutions that will improve the customer experience and provide workflow efficiencies we are pleased with our 2019 results over the last five years our net income has grown at a compounded annual rate of 42 and in 2019 it grew by 15 even as we continue to navigate a challenging interest rate environment we plan to build upon our entrepreneurial culture to attract and retain top talent as you ve heard me saying many times in the past our people are our greatest asset and are vital to our long term success we continue to be recognized for our innovation and are consistently ranked among the best banks to work for this recognition of our positive workplace environment and quality leadership only serves to reinforce our foundational approach to business as always i want to acknowledge the entire first internet bank team for their diligent and tireless work to achieve these strong results for our shareholders customers and the communities in which we operate their dedication and efforts are the key to our ongoing growth and success as we enter our 21st year i m excited about the pioneering foundation that we have built in digital banking and our proven success reaching more consumers and small businesses as they continue to increasingly embrace online banking our 20 years of experience uniquely positions us to continue servicing customers in the digital economy providing them with customer centric digital banking solutions while maintaining the personal touch of relationship banking i m looking forward to building upon our legacy and make an index next decade and even more fulfilling adventure with that i d like to turn the call over to ken to discuss our financial results in more detail kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david as david mentioned we are very happy with our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 especially our record net income and diluted eps for the quarter and the double digit growth compared to the linked quarter we continue to successfully manage overall loan growth through loan sales and we made important progress throughout 2019 and optimizing our earning asset mix our focus for the year ahead remains on disciplined capital efficient growth to drive increased profitability total asset growth moderated in the quarter which was consistent with our stated goal of managing the balance sheet around our internal capital generation capacity overall total loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter were 3 billion an increase of 82 million or 2 9 from the third quarter as we were able to deploy some of our excess liquidity in terms of portfolio composition total commercial loans were up 94 million or 4 3 compared to the linked quarter driven largely by production in healthcare finance and the addition of the sba loan portfolio total consumer loans declined by 9 million or 1 3 compared to the third quarter due primarily to elevated prepayments on portfolio residential mortgage loans as well as higher payoffs in the recreational vehicles and trailers portfolios as mentioned earlier we sold 54 million of loans during the first during the fourth quarter we also completed our first ever sales of sba 7 a guaranteed loans which included 9 2 million of balances we recognized a gain of 1 7 million from our loan sale activity in the fourth quarter compared to 500 000 in the third quarter we expect to continue executing sales of portfolio loans during 2028 to manage balance sheet growth and capital levels while also helping to improve our net interest margin and profitability moving on to deposits during the fourth quarter the cost of funds related to interest bearing deposits decreased by 5 basis points as the cost of new cd production and the rates paid on money market accounts declined during the quarter recall that we reflects we reached an inflection point in late in the third quarter when new cd production rates dropped below the rates on maturing cds and that trend continues we also reduced our money market deposit rates by 10 basis points in early november additionally a shift in the deposit mix from cds to money market accounts driven by growth in small business balances positively impacted deposit cost during the quarter to give you a sense of how cd rates have moved throughout 2019 the weighted average cost of new cds in the fourth quarter was 1 90 compared to the rate on maturing cds of 2 50 so the incremental benefit was 60 basis points versus an incremental cost of 116 basis points back in the fourth quarter of 2018 illustrating the meaningful convergence in cd cost over the last year in december new cds came on at a weighted average cost of 1 79 whereas maturing cds rolled off at 2 60 a positive spread of 81 basis points we expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of 2020 as the weighted average rate on scheduled cd maturities during the first quarter is 2 6 in total over the next 12 months we have approximately 1 1 billion of cds and broker deposits maturing at a weighted average cost of 2 59 additionally we have reduced our money market rates by another 10 basis points in january which will have a positive impact going forward based on our current money market balances of over 785 million turning to net interest income and net interest margin net interest income on both a gaap and fully taxable equivalent basis grew modestly compared to the linked quarter as an increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was essentially offset by the 5 basis point decline in the cost of funds net interest margin declined 3 basis points from the third quarter on both a gaap and a fully taxable equivalent basis the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin came in at 1 67 which was a little lower than what we were estimating for the quarter the variance between our forecast for net interest margin expansion and the actual result was due primarily to holding higher cash balances than we had modeled as we aggressively lower cd rates throughout the year we successfully minimized new cd production during the fourth quarter however cd renewals from existing retail and small business customers were significantly higher than we had projected which led to the increased cash position it is important to highlight that compared to the linked quarter deposit costs had a positive impact of 4 basis points on net interest margin and loan yields provided a benefit of 2 basis points however these were offset by the lower yields resulting from successive federal reserve rate cuts in september and october earned an elevated cash balances which had a negative impact of 7 basis points and on other interest earning assets which had a negative impact of 2 basis points as david noted we continue to feel good about the upward trajectory of net interest margin over the course of 2020 we are estimating that net interest margin should increase in the range of 20 to 25 basis points by the fourth quarter of 2020 actual results are likely to exhibit some quarterly volatility this year based on the trends in our excess cash balances but we are confident that the general direction is higher for three main reasons first for all the reasons discussed earlier our cost of deposits should continue to decline higher cost cds will either be replaced at lower rates or run off the balance sheet second our average cash balance is still about a 100 million to 125 million above our target level and should gradually come down as we put these funds to work in either higher yielding assets or to fund deposit runoff and third we are working hard to manage loan yields such that disciplined pricing and improvements in the composition of the portfolio can offset the impact of lower short term interest rates just a quick word on our non interest income as david mentioned our direct to consumer mortgage business continued to experience strong demand in a seasonally slower fourth quarter as long term interest rates remain low combined with the technology enhancements we have made to improve the customer experience and gain operating efficiencies the mortgage business has the potential to remain a solid performer in 2020 however as the industry is projecting a year over year decline in mortgage originations in 2020 our results are likely to moderate a bit but as we have discussed in the past the fees generated from our mortgage banking activity serve as a great natural hedge in the down rate environment giving us another reason to remain optimistic about the business we also anticipate higher sba related fees in 2020 as our fourth quarter results included only two months of contributions from our acquisition of first colorado s small business lending division based on our plans to build out this business line we expect its quarterly fee income run rate to continue to increase as both production levels and gain on sale revenues grow and the servicing portfolio grows with respect to our non interest expenses the increase of 1 4 million from the third quarter was due primarily to increases in deposit insurance premium higher consulting and professional fees and an increase in salaries and employee benefits deposit insurance premium expense resumed in the fourth quarter after not incurring any expense in the third quarter as a result of the small bank assessment credit applied by the fdic the increase in consulting and professional fees was tied to higher recruiting fees and third party loan review fees the increase in salaries and employee benefits was due mainly to the headcount growth in our sba lending business now turning to asset quality overall credit quality remains solid in the aggregate non performing loans increased by 900 000 to 6 7 million while the ratio of non performing loans to total loans remained relatively low at 23 basis points net charge offs of 300 000 were recognized during the fourth quarter resulting in net charge offs to average loans of 4 basis points as compared to 15 basis points in the third quarter the decline in net charge offs was due primarily to an 800 00 charge off on a commercial loan relationship in the third quarter with respect to capital our overall capital levels remained sound as david mentioned our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 7 3 in the fourth quarter from 7 10 in the third quarter this came in above our targeted year end range of 7 25 to 7 30 our expectation is for the tce ratio to increase throughout 2020 and be in the range of 7 85 to 8 through the end of the year as internal capital generation and balance sheet management strategies support our organic loan origination activities with that i will turn it back over to the operator so we can take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question will come from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito kbw analyst hey david ken good afternoon how you guys doing david b becker president and chief executive officer all right kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer doing good mike how are you michael perito kbw analyst good thank you i wanted to add couple of things obviously it was a nice revenue quarter for you guys which is good to see with regards to the sba team i mean can you give us a sense i guess of where some of the conference is coming from to kind of grow that product moving forward is it simply that the team had a lot of pent up demand at the prior institution and with a bigger balance sheet more capital or they are able to do more or is there something else that work that s kind of driving the ability to grow that revenue source in 2020 kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well mike it s probably a combination of several things with that first we did bring on a team a small team from first colorado and primarily the primary kind of staffing benefit from that deal was really getting adding to our back office bench strength they have experienced closures servicers portfolio managers credit we did bring on one bdo as well but the combination of that with our own efforts because we ve been as we announced earlier in the year we brought on an individual to build out a national sales platform for us and we ve actually added people on our own throughout the course of the year what you call kind of sba operations capacity so we have the ability to service these loans which have some twist to them because of the governmental aspect to them so as we look out and we kind of model out our expectations for sba it s really not just limited to the team we acquired but it s everything that we re doing in total which is we look at it as one big team versus kind of two different components michael perito kbw analyst okay and then we just do you know what can you just to avoid any confusion give us the dollar amount like if the team was on for a full quarter as opposed to just two months what that variance was kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer in terms of revenue it well it s tricky because we haven t we ve just started to originate our own loans here so we re really coming from zero for ourselves the servicing portfolio is probably if we can grow that by itself that s probably maybe 1 2 million to 1 4 million of revenue next year but we re really kind of looking at the ramp up of the lending opportunity as really the combined effort between the teams here i mean maybe another way to look at it is that by the end of the year and fourth quarter the origination the bdo teams that we plan on having on board will be at about 100 million a year run rate and i think that s probably being conservative because we re hoping to get people on board sooner rather than later but that s kind of the way we have originations modeled throughout the course of 2020 michael perito kbw analyst okay and maybe switching over to the margin so i mean it seems like you guys still feel like by the end of the year if you get to call it that 2 ish percent almost type 1 90 to 2 type run rate on a te basis based on where you are today i know you said it s going to be choppy quarter to quarter i was wondering if you had any initial sense here almost the month through the first quarter i mean do you think you expect 1q 20 to kind of have some lift even regardless of the excess liquidity that might take some time to work off kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we do expect a little bit of a lift right now it s not quite through a month it s a little bit hard to pinpoint the basis point expansion in here in the fourth quarter excuse me in the first quarter but we are expecting some lift i mean again as we said we feel pretty good about the year it s just going to be how fast we can get the excess capital excuse me excess liquidity out the door david b becker president and chief executive officer one thing that might impact us a little bit mike in this first quarter we have a pretty significant loan sale of about 100 million coming up and the key will be to get that cash back to work quickly so that we re going to have a soft quarter i would tell you first quarter will be the softness of the bunch but on board with ken by year end between now and december 31 you ll see 20 points plus in margin expansion michael perito kbw analyst got it and then david just i ll have you one last one and then i ll step back some other guys companies but just with that said with the sba team at a point where hopefully there is much more revenue than expense in 2020 the margin percent is moving up what s the thoughts on kind of profitability improvement in 2020 and what s realistic for us to expect thanks guys david b becker president and chief executive officer i don t have that sheet right in front of me ken will kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well yes i think again mike you had a good point there that we do kind of have some ramp up expense here in the sba business because i think we ve tried to go about it thoughtfully and make sure we have the back office in the operations built so we don t stub our toe in the regulatory world and because sba had certain as you know from covering other banks if you don t dot eyes and cross tees in sba you pay for it down the road so there is some ramp up cost here i mean we expect over the course of the year for roa and roes to go up i m not going to say significantly but they will continue to improve such that maybe by the third by the fourth quarter we re hopefully in that call it 80 to 85 basis point range of roa as we ve again the originators and the bdos are on board and out originating david b becker president and chief executive officer and then michael we build up the sba process over the course of the year and i agree with ken that we re going to get to year end with about 100 million in originations with the servicing portfolio that we picked up and the team that we ve built out here prior to acquire in the first colorado group the sba program is profitable on a month to month basis now as ken pointed out there is a lot of regulatory hoops that we re jumping through but we ve got a good team on board from the back office side to make sure all of that is done properly and we definitely have the ability to add videos we announced last weak a new business development also joining us on the east coast and he has reputation as historical background is a 20 million a year origination and we expect them to hit that in more over the course of the year so we re locked in pretty solid it will be a very positive year for us on the sba side michael perito kbw analyst great thanks guys operator our next question will come from george sutton of craig hallum please go ahead george sutton craig hallum analyst thank you nice results guys i wondered if you could give us your thought process on gain of sale plans relative to what you ve defined as excess liquidity how are you determining when to take the gain on sale david b becker president and chief executive officer you want to go first kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean in terms of i mean some of it is just looking at what the gain on sale pricing in the premiums are in the market and right now based on our initial entry into the space in the fourth quarter gain on sale premiums are pretty healthy kind of in that 109 million 110 million even i think we got 113 million on one of our sales so the premiums are pretty good and i think as long as we can sell sulfur premiums in that range we ll take advantage of that and clip the gain on sale in the immediate revenue today i mean like others in the sba space we ll obviously stay on top of that and if gain on sale premiums were to decline get down in 106 million 105 million that range or where the gain on sale is does the cost benefit between holding the what s a really relatively high yielding asset on your books is more advantageous will elect to do that and the nice thing about the sba business as you do have some balance sheet flexibility with that and if premiums kind of return to norm if they get depressed and come back to revert to the mean if you will then you have the opportunity to sell it at that point david b becker president and chief executive officer the other side that we re looking at george too is we have an opportunity we re going to unload about 100 million portfolio in the 30 year consumer mortgages some arms but the bulk of it is 30 year mortgages with probably blended yield in a 3 75 and we can replace that with the commercial side of things where all of our categories are above four the sba s above six so being able to take pick up 125 to 150 basis points by swapping out portfolios it will be we re not obviously going to sell it one day it replace with next day but within a quarter we think we can backfill that sale and that s the biggest sale we re looking in the range of 25 million to 50 million a quarter in sale as we discussed last quarter we don t want to stop our sales pipeline yes we don t want to grow the balance sheet geometrically so we ll get a little bit of influx here in the first quarter but will be 25 million to 50 million going forward and that allow us to keep the sales engine running full steam and we re actually replacing lower priced assets with top quality higher priced assets so it s a winning trade for us all in all george sutton craig hallum analyst i appreciate you re laying out the 100 million by the end of the year run rate on origination sba can you give us a sense of a longer term plan there how significant do you view this pertaining to be relative to the rest of your specialty platforms david b becker president and chief executive officer i m pretty confident the pace we re on and we ll get to the 200 million a year in originations by the end of 2021 we re going to hit a point where growth doesn t really accomplished much for us there but we re pretty confident we ll get it over 200 million by the end it will double down in 2021 george sutton craig hallum analyst perfect thanks guys kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks george operator and our next question will come from nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead nathan race piper sandler analyst hi guys david b becker president and chief executive officer hey nate good morning nate nathan race piper sandler analyst was hoping to just touch base on deposit growth expectations just given the benefits that you guys have with a lot of cds rolling off and what you re paying on deposits today so just curious how we should think about deposit growth into this year and if you could kind of just remind us what your kind of comfort level or ranges for the loan to deposit ratio kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer what was the last part of that nate the loan to deposit ratio nathan race piper sandler analyst yes kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think overall i mean right now we re kind of forecasting relatively modest overall balance sheet growth again as our sales teams and commercial lines of business have a lot of opportunity in front of them but like as we said sba is going to be primarily an originate and sell model for the foreseeable future and we ll continue to take advantage of portfolio sales especially in the single tenant and public finance space in the single tenant space we ve been out to market enough where we have repeat buyers coming back to us who are names that you guys would all know in the bank space who have recognized the pretty solid credits that we originate so we expect overall balance sheet growth to be fairly modest and i think probably on the loan side we ll the plan is to migrate that excess liquidity into the loan portfolio over the court hopefully sooner in the earlier part of the year but really run that cash balance down more toward our target level in the deposit side i wouldn t say we see a significant amount of growth because we ll i think we ll continue to have success in the money market business and especially in the small business money markets but from an overall composition that growth will be offset by probably a significant amount of the broker deposit run off as well as cd run off so i think when we look forecast at the end of the year what that means is that loans to deposit ratio it s going to creep upwards we prefer to keep it under 100 and i think as of now we don t really expect it to be that high probably more in kind of the call it 96 to 97 98 range versus 93 94 today nathan race piper sandler analyst understood david b becker president and chief executive officer nathan just backing up on just backing up a quick second on ken s comment so i think as we said we re going to see the positive mix change over the quarter one thing we ve been very successful in the last six to nine months we have a new small business checking savings program that we rolled out and we are consistently bringing in 20 million to 25 million a month in new deposits in money market and low cost checking accounts in the small business community so that will definitely help our cost of cost of funds as well over the year as ken said we ve had some brokered cds couple of hundred million that will mature over the next 12 months that is a guarantee we will not put those back on the balance sheet will replace that with the small business accounts so mix will change overall growth will be minimal nathan race piper sandler analyst okay that s very helpful and i guess just on the sba front from a credit quality perspective just given that you guys are still in a lot of that product going forward is it fair to just to expect you kind of charge offs kind of in the range that we saw in 1q 2q and 4q of last year this year particularly in light of balance sheet growth expectations being fairly really low for 2020 david b becker president and chief executive officer yes i think our history speaks for itself and we ve changed nothing on the credit parameters and even in the sba world in my mind and i ll give you my philosophy on sba sba does not make a bad loan good so we re as tight on our credit standards in the sba world as we can be and again looking at the history and performance of the first colorado portfolio looking at the history and performance of the folks that we re bringing on and they assets generated in the past in the quality of them we don t see a significant bump up obviously we have to reserve at a higher component for the sba than some of our other loans but we re pretty confident quality is going to stay right where it s at we don t see any significant but that s a major downturn in the economy any real change in the charge off category nathan race piper sandler analyst okay very helpful and if i could just ask lastly on expense growth expectations for 2020 obviously some moving pieces with the sba team being on board for the full year in some additional hires so just any thoughts on maybe a quarterly run rate for 2020 kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer on the expense side kind of all in it s going to increase somewhat obviously with the investment in the sba i think probably i think the all in incremental expense once we have for 2020 with the hires assuming we keep to the schedule that we have that s probably going to add 3 million to the expense category kind of all in so i think probably where we re at today obviously first quarter you re going to have all of the beginning of the year resets on the employee side and we ll have a fully a full year s impact of other hires we made outside of sba this year as we ve continued to build out our teams in the it space and added to certain areas across the bank so it could probably maybe 12 5 to 13 over 12 5 to kind of running out to 13 5 over the course of the year but that s going to be just really dependent on timing of hires and that s probably i think that s probably on the higher side i think that s a conservative number nathan race piper sandler analyst okay great i appreciate all the color thank you david b becker president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question will come from john rodis of janney please go ahead sir john rodis janney analyst good afternoon guys david b becker president and chief executive officer hey john john rodis janney analyst hey the expected loan sale of 100 million in the first quarter so if i m thinking about that right so all things equal your loan portfolio is going to probably be down from in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter is that right david b becker president and chief executive officer it could very well be down yes down to neutral growth for the first quarter john rodis janney analyst okay okay and then ken that you keep saying modest growth for 2020 which i appreciate it does this sort of reading between the lines is modest mean is that low single digits in your mind kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes that s probably low low to mid single digits on asset growth john rodis janney analyst yes okay and then the loan sale gain in the fourth quarter of 1 7 million which was up nicely from the 523 000 in the third quarter yet you sold you sold a similar amount of loans i know there was roughly 9 million in sba but correct me if i m wrong but i don t think that sba piece drove the difference so why did you get better pricing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well some of it had to do with the quality of the portfolios i mean we sold in the of the single tenant we sold three we sold three different transactions where we just we negotiated pretty solid pricing that was all above kind of in the range of 102 and higher one of the sales was under that in kind of the 101 101 in half range but that was a very low yielding pool that we sold which was a good trade from our perspective and then on the public finance side we also had gains there whereas maybe some prior quarters certain sales of public finance loans had been kind of legacy kind of 2017 type of originations prior to tax reform that were originated so the fte tax rate on those were quite as high as they would have been prior to tax reform where we sold them for par value or maybe a nominal loss whereas we sold some higher yielding stuff in public finance that we actually clip some nice premiums on when you break down that 1 7 million a million of that came from portfolio loans and the 700 000 that difference was in the sba space david b becker president and chief executive officer this is a heads up john and for the rest of year the 100 million portfolio sale that is coming up here latter part of january early part of february is a mortgage pool that was going to be pretty much at par there is not a big pick up on that but we are as i stated earlier getting rid of 100 million in assets that reyielding about a 370 glide and we ll replace them other part of it we ve been in the market long enough and we re but we have interest in the play we re able to sell most of these portfolios in the fourth quarter and what we re looking at here is the first part of the year we have no brokers in between and that helps good chunk of the yields that we re getting there the earnings were pick it up john rodis janney analyst okay fair enough thanks guys and then ken you said tce approaching high sevens 8 by the end of this year any thoughts on does that include any buyback activity or what are your thoughts today on buybacks guys david b becker president and chief executive officer yes that does not include buyback activity as of right now our board hasn t authorized a new repurchase plan i think our view on it is again as i ve used this term before it s a balancing act i we obviously want to continue building capital so i think probably the way that we re going to look at it is let s get through the first quarter and kind of see how trends look see what profitability looks like see with the balance sheet looks like and see how our forecast have changed if at all and revisit the topic then to see if we re able to build capital faster than we expect that will probably give us an opportunity to talk to the board about implementing a new repurchase plan john rodis janney analyst okay and then ken just on the provisioning obviously a pretty big drop in the fourth quarter relative to the first three quarters how should we sort of and obviously given the expected loan sales and so forth how should we think about provisioning going forward for this year for 20 kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer i think in general overall provisioning a couple of different levers on that i think provisioning in general should be lower than we ve had in the past just simply because poor overall portfolio growth is going to be much much less as loan sales helped to offset new originations so really you re period end portfolio at any given time is not going to probably show a lot of growth so i think historically we re probably without thinking about sba for a minute provisioning should be probably under well under 1 million a quarter now as david alluded to earlier with the growth in the sba the sba balances that are retained on the balance sheet those are going to be reserved at a higher level just simply because of the perceived risk with small business lending say as versus single tenant finance so that will kind of act as we add those balances to the balance sheet that will somewhat not offset the decline in provisioning due to balance sheet management but it will kind of increase the coverage ratio if you will over the course of the year now remember our goal here today is initially is to originate the guaranteed pieces of the 7 a loans which means for every dollar we originate we re only retaining 0 25 so sba balances will grow over the course of the year but certainly not to the extent that total originations do john rodis janney analyst okay so ken i just want to make sure i heard so you said you think less than 1 million a quarter but that excludes the impact from sba is that right kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that includes actually that includes the sba if you ramp it up by the end of the year to a little bit over 1 million but earlier in the year when we re still building balances there s just not that much of an impact because it s such a smaller part of the portfolio so for the first half of the year we expect provisioning to be below 1 million in the second half of the year it will be probably a little bit above 1 million a quarter john rodis janney analyst okay and then just one final question on the margin if you sort of look at the fourth quarter where did it end sort of in december did the margin end kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer above what the quarterly number was i mean we were probably we were in the low 170s in december david b becker president and chief executive officer we had a little bit of a dip in october john over what we were in september and then it improved in november and december both months saw improvement john rodis janney analyst okay super thanks guys kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thanks john operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to

david b becker president and chief executive officer thank you larry good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today we have a great deal to be proud of upon completion of our 20th year of operations we finished 2019 on a high note and with substantial momentum and i d like to highlight a few of those accomplishments our team delivered record quarterly net income of 7 1 million and record quarterly diluted eps of 0 72 in 2019 we also produced a record annual net income of 25 2 million and record annual diluted eps of 2 51 during the quarter our cost of interest bearing deposits declined 5 basis points from the third quarter to 2 35 and our asset quality remains solid with non performing assets to total assets of only 22 basis points while charge offs to average loans totaled 4 basis points which is generally consistent with our historical performance we were able to deploy some of the excess liquidity and completed the acquisition of first colorado national bank small business lending division this represented another important step into our ongoing efforts to build a nationwide small business platform i ll provide more details on this in just a few minutes we continue to manage balance sheet growth through loan sales which during the fourth quarter included 54 million of single tenant leasing and public finance loans and also we completed our first ever sales of the sba 7 a loans additionally while seasonally slower when compared with the prior quarter our direct to consumer mortgage business was again strong in the fourth quarter reflecting the positive impact of investments we made earlier in the year to improve both the customer experience and the workflow efficiency in the mortgage origination process our balance sheet management strategy is not only strengthened our earnings for the quarter but also allowed us to build capital as the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased from 7 1 to 7 33 furthermore our tangible book value per share increased 3 4 quarter over quarter to 30 82 and was up 10 3 for the year from a lending perspective our teams remained active and engaged while overall loan balances only increased 247 million or 9 for the year our teams actually produced over 900 million of funded originations and commitments our single tenant leasing lease financing public finance and healthcare finance businesses remain our largest commercial lines and add combined production of over 550 million for the year we are also very active on the consumer side of our business our specialty lines of horse trailer and rv lending led the way with 82 million of combined production and our direct to consumer mortgage business originated an additional 645 million of mortgage loans that were sold in the secondary market we grew our nationwide branchless deposit franchise by over 480 million in 2019 which included 258 million of growth in our money market accounts in particular our efforts to bring in more small business money market and checking accounts were extremely successful and contributed to over 190 million of the annual growth and the deposit balances the combination of the shift toward money market balances and aggressive downward repricing of cds allowed us to better manage deposit costs in the second half of the year this is a trend that we expected to continue throughout 2020 let me shift gears for a moment and provide an update on our sba business we continue to make progress with our expansion into small business banking with attractive opportunities on both sides of our balance sheet this is a meaningful and long term element of our strategy we brought on an experienced professionals during the year to begin building the foundation of our platform and we appointed new sales leadership to head up our expanding national sba program with ambitious plans to further build out our presence in 2020 we completed our acquisition of the small business lending division of first colorado national bank in november and doing so we picked up a 35 million portfolio of loans and a servicing portfolio of approximately 100 million we also gained a talented team of professionals in the areas of credit portfolio management and servicing that will help us accelerate our growth in small business lending the pipeline of new lending opportunities continues to grow and our efforts on the deposit side are producing positive results we believe that we can differentiate ourselves with a full suite of products and a consistently high level of service that emerging entrepreneurs need and that many larger banks do not prioritize importantly as we grow our asset quality remains exceptional it is among the best in the industry and is driven not only by our strong credit culture and disciplined approach to underwriting but also by our focus on certain specialty lending lines that target lower risk asset classes such as our public finance and our single tenant lease financing business looking at on the year ahead we are laser focused on improving financial returns we will do this by continuing to execute on the initiatives that we successfully implemented in 2019 building our capital base is a priority for us and we intend to drive this through improved profitability and disciplined balance sheet management while our overall balance sheet growth for 2020 may be modest especially by our standards we still expect strong loan production from our lines of business but we ll continue to execute loan sales to manage capital supplement non interest income and improve overall portfolio yields these strategies combined with disciplined loan pricing and the strong downward trend in deposit pricing are expected to produce net interest expansion during the year 2020 we also continue to invest in forward looking technologies to further enhance our digital focused approach for example following the demonstrated success in our mortgage business we are moving on to commercial and small business lending to implement new solutions that will improve the customer experience and provide workflow efficiencies we are pleased with our 2019 results over the last five years our net income has grown at a compounded annual rate of 42 and in 2019 it grew by 15 even as we continue to navigate a challenging interest rate environment we plan to build upon our entrepreneurial culture to attract and retain top talent as you ve heard me saying many times in the past our people are our greatest asset and are vital to our long term success we continue to be recognized for our innovation and are consistently ranked among the best banks to work for this recognition of our positive workplace environment and quality leadership only serves to reinforce our foundational approach to business as always i want to acknowledge the entire first internet bank team for their diligent and tireless work to achieve these strong results for our shareholders customers and the communities in which we operate their dedication and efforts are the key to our ongoing growth and success as we enter our 21st year i m excited about the pioneering foundation that we have built in digital banking and our proven success reaching more consumers and small businesses as they continue to increasingly embrace online banking our 20 years of experience uniquely positions us to continue servicing customers in the digital economy providing them with customer centric digital banking solutions while maintaining the personal touch of relationship banking i m looking forward to building upon our legacy and make an index next decade and even more fulfilling adventure with that i d like to turn the call over to ken to discuss our financial results in more detail kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david as david mentioned we are very happy with our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 especially our record net income and diluted eps for the quarter and the double digit growth compared to the linked quarter we continue to successfully manage overall loan growth through loan sales and we made important progress throughout 2019 and optimizing our earning asset mix our focus for the year ahead remains on disciplined capital efficient growth to drive increased profitability total asset growth moderated in the quarter which was consistent with our stated goal of managing the balance sheet around our internal capital generation capacity overall total loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter were 3 billion an increase of 82 million or 2 9 from the third quarter as we were able to deploy some of our excess liquidity in terms of portfolio composition total commercial loans were up 94 million or 4 3 compared to the linked quarter driven largely by production in healthcare finance and the addition of the sba loan portfolio total consumer loans declined by 9 million or 1 3 compared to the third quarter due primarily to elevated prepayments on portfolio residential mortgage loans as well as higher payoffs in the recreational vehicles and trailers portfolios as mentioned earlier we sold 54 million of loans during the first during the fourth quarter we also completed our first ever sales of sba 7 a guaranteed loans which included 9 2 million of balances we recognized a gain of 1 7 million from our loan sale activity in the fourth quarter compared to 500 000 in the third quarter we expect to continue executing sales of portfolio loans during 2028 to manage balance sheet growth and capital levels while also helping to improve our net interest margin and profitability moving on to deposits during the fourth quarter the cost of funds related to interest bearing deposits decreased by 5 basis points as the cost of new cd production and the rates paid on money market accounts declined during the quarter recall that we reflects we reached an inflection point in late in the third quarter when new cd production rates dropped below the rates on maturing cds and that trend continues we also reduced our money market deposit rates by 10 basis points in early november additionally a shift in the deposit mix from cds to money market accounts driven by growth in small business balances positively impacted deposit cost during the quarter to give you a sense of how cd rates have moved throughout 2019 the weighted average cost of new cds in the fourth quarter was 1 90 compared to the rate on maturing cds of 2 50 so the incremental benefit was 60 basis points versus an incremental cost of 116 basis points back in the fourth quarter of 2018 illustrating the meaningful convergence in cd cost over the last year in december new cds came on at a weighted average cost of 1 79 whereas maturing cds rolled off at 2 60 a positive spread of 81 basis points we expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of 2020 as the weighted average rate on scheduled cd maturities during the first quarter is 2 6 in total over the next 12 months we have approximately 1 1 billion of cds and broker deposits maturing at a weighted average cost of 2 59 additionally we have reduced our money market rates by another 10 basis points in january which will have a positive impact going forward based on our current money market balances of over 785 million turning to net interest income and net interest margin net interest income on both a gaap and fully taxable equivalent basis grew modestly compared to the linked quarter as an increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was essentially offset by the 5 basis point decline in the cost of funds net interest margin declined 3 basis points from the third quarter on both a gaap and a fully taxable equivalent basis the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin came in at 1 67 which was a little lower than what we were estimating for the quarter the variance between our forecast for net interest margin expansion and the actual result was due primarily to holding higher cash balances than we had modeled as we aggressively lower cd rates throughout the year we successfully minimized new cd production during the fourth quarter however cd renewals from existing retail and small business customers were significantly higher than we had projected which led to the increased cash position it is important to highlight that compared to the linked quarter deposit costs had a positive impact of 4 basis points on net interest margin and loan yields provided a benefit of 2 basis points however these were offset by the lower yields resulting from successive federal reserve rate cuts in september and october earned an elevated cash balances which had a negative impact of 7 basis points and on other interest earning assets which had a negative impact of 2 basis points as david noted we continue to feel good about the upward trajectory of net interest margin over the course of 2020 we are estimating that net interest margin should increase in the range of 20 to 25 basis points by the fourth quarter of 2020 actual results are likely to exhibit some quarterly volatility this year based on the trends in our excess cash balances but we are confident that the general direction is higher for three main reasons first for all the reasons discussed earlier our cost of deposits should continue to decline higher cost cds will either be replaced at lower rates or run off the balance sheet second our average cash balance is still about a 100 million to 125 million above our target level and should gradually come down as we put these funds to work in either higher yielding assets or to fund deposit runoff and third we are working hard to manage loan yields such that disciplined pricing and improvements in the composition of the portfolio can offset the impact of lower short term interest rates just a quick word on our non interest income as david mentioned our direct to consumer mortgage business continued to experience strong demand in a seasonally slower fourth quarter as long term interest rates remain low combined with the technology enhancements we have made to improve the customer experience and gain operating efficiencies the mortgage business has the potential to remain a solid performer in 2020 however as the industry is projecting a year over year decline in mortgage originations in 2020 our results are likely to moderate a bit but as we have discussed in the past the fees generated from our mortgage banking activity serve as a great natural hedge in the down rate environment giving us another reason to remain optimistic about the business we also anticipate higher sba related fees in 2020 as our fourth quarter results included only two months of contributions from our acquisition of first colorado s small business lending division based on our plans to build out this business line we expect its quarterly fee income run rate to continue to increase as both production levels and gain on sale revenues grow and the servicing portfolio grows with respect to our non interest expenses the increase of 1 4 million from the third quarter was due primarily to increases in deposit insurance premium higher consulting and professional fees and an increase in salaries and employee benefits deposit insurance premium expense resumed in the fourth quarter after not incurring any expense in the third quarter as a result of the small bank assessment credit applied by the fdic the increase in consulting and professional fees was tied to higher recruiting fees and third party loan review fees the increase in salaries and employee benefits was due mainly to the headcount growth in our sba lending business now turning to asset quality overall credit quality remains solid in the aggregate non performing loans increased by 900 000 to 6 7 million while the ratio of non performing loans to total loans remained relatively low at 23 basis points net charge offs of 300 000 were recognized during the fourth quarter resulting in net charge offs to average loans of 4 basis points as compared to 15 basis points in the third quarter the decline in net charge offs was due primarily to an 800 00 charge off on a commercial loan relationship in the third quarter with respect to capital our overall capital levels remained sound as david mentioned our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 7 3 in the fourth quarter from 7 10 in the third quarter this came in above our targeted year end range of 7 25 to 7 30 our expectation is for the tce ratio to increase throughout 2020 and be in the range of 7 85 to 8 through the end of the year as internal capital generation and balance sheet management strategies support our organic loan origination activities with that i will turn it back over to the operator so we can take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question will come from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito kbw analyst hey david ken good afternoon how you guys doing david b becker president and chief executive officer all right kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer doing good mike how are you michael perito kbw analyst good thank you i wanted to add couple of things obviously it was a nice revenue quarter for you guys which is good to see with regards to the sba team i mean can you give us a sense i guess of where some of the conference is coming from to kind of grow that product moving forward is it simply that the team had a lot of pent up demand at the prior institution and with a bigger balance sheet more capital or they are able to do more or is there something else that work that s kind of driving the ability to grow that revenue source in 2020 kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well mike it s probably a combination of several things with that first we did bring on a team a small team from first colorado and primarily the primary kind of staffing benefit from that deal was really getting adding to our back office bench strength they have experienced closures servicers portfolio managers credit we did bring on one bdo as well but the combination of that with our own efforts because we ve been as we announced earlier in the year we brought on an individual to build out a national sales platform for us and we ve actually added people on our own throughout the course of the year what you call kind of sba operations capacity so we have the ability to service these loans which have some twist to them because of the governmental aspect to them so as we look out and we kind of model out our expectations for sba it s really not just limited to the team we acquired but it s everything that we re doing in total which is we look at it as one big team versus kind of two different components michael perito kbw analyst okay and then we just do you know what can you just to avoid any confusion give us the dollar amount like if the team was on for a full quarter as opposed to just two months what that variance was kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer in terms of revenue it well it s tricky because we haven t we ve just started to originate our own loans here so we re really coming from zero for ourselves the servicing portfolio is probably if we can grow that by itself that s probably maybe 1 2 million to 1 4 million of revenue next year but we re really kind of looking at the ramp up of the lending opportunity as really the combined effort between the teams here i mean maybe another way to look at it is that by the end of the year and fourth quarter the origination the bdo teams that we plan on having on board will be at about 100 million a year run rate and i think that s probably being conservative because we re hoping to get people on board sooner rather than later but that s kind of the way we have originations modeled throughout the course of 2020 michael perito kbw analyst okay and maybe switching over to the margin so i mean it seems like you guys still feel like by the end of the year if you get to call it that 2 ish percent almost type 1 90 to 2 type run rate on a te basis based on where you are today i know you said it s going to be choppy quarter to quarter i was wondering if you had any initial sense here almost the month through the first quarter i mean do you think you expect 1q 20 to kind of have some lift even regardless of the excess liquidity that might take some time to work off kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we do expect a little bit of a lift right now it s not quite through a month it s a little bit hard to pinpoint the basis point expansion in here in the fourth quarter excuse me in the first quarter but we are expecting some lift i mean again as we said we feel pretty good about the year it s just going to be how fast we can get the excess capital excuse me excess liquidity out the door david b becker president and chief executive officer one thing that might impact us a little bit mike in this first quarter we have a pretty significant loan sale of about 100 million coming up and the key will be to get that cash back to work quickly so that we re going to have a soft quarter i would tell you first quarter will be the softness of the bunch but on board with ken by year end between now and december 31 you ll see 20 points plus in margin expansion michael perito kbw analyst got it and then david just i ll have you one last one and then i ll step back some other guys companies but just with that said with the sba team at a point where hopefully there is much more revenue than expense in 2020 the margin percent is moving up what s the thoughts on kind of profitability improvement in 2020 and what s realistic for us to expect thanks guys david b becker president and chief executive officer i don t have that sheet right in front of me ken will kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well yes i think again mike you had a good point there that we do kind of have some ramp up expense here in the sba business because i think we ve tried to go about it thoughtfully and make sure we have the back office in the operations built so we don t stub our toe in the regulatory world and because sba had certain as you know from covering other banks if you don t dot eyes and cross tees in sba you pay for it down the road so there is some ramp up cost here i mean we expect over the course of the year for roa and roes to go up i m not going to say significantly but they will continue to improve such that maybe by the third by the fourth quarter we re hopefully in that call it 80 to 85 basis point range of roa as we ve again the originators and the bdos are on board and out originating david b becker president and chief executive officer and then michael we build up the sba process over the course of the year and i agree with ken that we re going to get to year end with about 100 million in originations with the servicing portfolio that we picked up and the team that we ve built out here prior to acquire in the first colorado group the sba program is profitable on a month to month basis now as ken pointed out there is a lot of regulatory hoops that we re jumping through but we ve got a good team on board from the back office side to make sure all of that is done properly and we definitely have the ability to add videos we announced last weak a new business development also joining us on the east coast and he has reputation as historical background is a 20 million a year origination and we expect them to hit that in more over the course of the year so we re locked in pretty solid it will be a very positive year for us on the sba side michael perito kbw analyst great thanks guys operator our next question will come from george sutton of craig hallum please go ahead george sutton craig hallum analyst thank you nice results guys i wondered if you could give us your thought process on gain of sale plans relative to what you ve defined as excess liquidity how are you determining when to take the gain on sale david b becker president and chief executive officer you want to go first kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean in terms of i mean some of it is just looking at what the gain on sale pricing in the premiums are in the market and right now based on our initial entry into the space in the fourth quarter gain on sale premiums are pretty healthy kind of in that 109 million 110 million even i think we got 113 million on one of our sales so the premiums are pretty good and i think as long as we can sell sulfur premiums in that range we ll take advantage of that and clip the gain on sale in the immediate revenue today i mean like others in the sba space we ll obviously stay on top of that and if gain on sale premiums were to decline get down in 106 million 105 million that range or where the gain on sale is does the cost benefit between holding the what s a really relatively high yielding asset on your books is more advantageous will elect to do that and the nice thing about the sba business as you do have some balance sheet flexibility with that and if premiums kind of return to norm if they get depressed and come back to revert to the mean if you will then you have the opportunity to sell it at that point david b becker president and chief executive officer the other side that we re looking at george too is we have an opportunity we re going to unload about 100 million portfolio in the 30 year consumer mortgages some arms but the bulk of it is 30 year mortgages with probably blended yield in a 3 75 and we can replace that with the commercial side of things where all of our categories are above four the sba s above six so being able to take pick up 125 to 150 basis points by swapping out portfolios it will be we re not obviously going to sell it one day it replace with next day but within a quarter we think we can backfill that sale and that s the biggest sale we re looking in the range of 25 million to 50 million a quarter in sale as we discussed last quarter we don t want to stop our sales pipeline yes we don t want to grow the balance sheet geometrically so we ll get a little bit of influx here in the first quarter but will be 25 million to 50 million going forward and that allow us to keep the sales engine running full steam and we re actually replacing lower priced assets with top quality higher priced assets so it s a winning trade for us all in all george sutton craig hallum analyst i appreciate you re laying out the 100 million by the end of the year run rate on origination sba can you give us a sense of a longer term plan there how significant do you view this pertaining to be relative to the rest of your specialty platforms david b becker president and chief executive officer i m pretty confident the pace we re on and we ll get to the 200 million a year in originations by the end of 2021 we re going to hit a point where growth doesn t really accomplished much for us there but we re pretty confident we ll get it over 200 million by the end it will double down in 2021 george sutton craig hallum analyst perfect thanks guys kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks george operator and our next question will come from nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead nathan race piper sandler analyst hi guys david b becker president and chief executive officer hey nate good morning nate nathan race piper sandler analyst was hoping to just touch base on deposit growth expectations just given the benefits that you guys have with a lot of cds rolling off and what you re paying on deposits today so just curious how we should think about deposit growth into this year and if you could kind of just remind us what your kind of comfort level or ranges for the loan to deposit ratio kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer what was the last part of that nate the loan to deposit ratio nathan race piper sandler analyst yes kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think overall i mean right now we re kind of forecasting relatively modest overall balance sheet growth again as our sales teams and commercial lines of business have a lot of opportunity in front of them but like as we said sba is going to be primarily an originate and sell model for the foreseeable future and we ll continue to take advantage of portfolio sales especially in the single tenant and public finance space in the single tenant space we ve been out to market enough where we have repeat buyers coming back to us who are names that you guys would all know in the bank space who have recognized the pretty solid credits that we originate so we expect overall balance sheet growth to be fairly modest and i think probably on the loan side we ll the plan is to migrate that excess liquidity into the loan portfolio over the court hopefully sooner in the earlier part of the year but really run that cash balance down more toward our target level in the deposit side i wouldn t say we see a significant amount of growth because we ll i think we ll continue to have success in the money market business and especially in the small business money markets but from an overall composition that growth will be offset by probably a significant amount of the broker deposit run off as well as cd run off so i think when we look forecast at the end of the year what that means is that loans to deposit ratio it s going to creep upwards we prefer to keep it under 100 and i think as of now we don t really expect it to be that high probably more in kind of the call it 96 to 97 98 range versus 93 94 today nathan race piper sandler analyst understood david b becker president and chief executive officer nathan just backing up on just backing up a quick second on ken s comment so i think as we said we re going to see the positive mix change over the quarter one thing we ve been very successful in the last six to nine months we have a new small business checking savings program that we rolled out and we are consistently bringing in 20 million to 25 million a month in new deposits in money market and low cost checking accounts in the small business community so that will definitely help our cost of cost of funds as well over the year as ken said we ve had some brokered cds couple of hundred million that will mature over the next 12 months that is a guarantee we will not put those back on the balance sheet will replace that with the small business accounts so mix will change overall growth will be minimal nathan race piper sandler analyst okay that s very helpful and i guess just on the sba front from a credit quality perspective just given that you guys are still in a lot of that product going forward is it fair to just to expect you kind of charge offs kind of in the range that we saw in 1q 2q and 4q of last year this year particularly in light of balance sheet growth expectations being fairly really low for 2020 david b becker president and chief executive officer yes i think our history speaks for itself and we ve changed nothing on the credit parameters and even in the sba world in my mind and i ll give you my philosophy on sba sba does not make a bad loan good so we re as tight on our credit standards in the sba world as we can be and again looking at the history and performance of the first colorado portfolio looking at the history and performance of the folks that we re bringing on and they assets generated in the past in the quality of them we don t see a significant bump up obviously we have to reserve at a higher component for the sba than some of our other loans but we re pretty confident quality is going to stay right where it s at we don t see any significant but that s a major downturn in the economy any real change in the charge off category nathan race piper sandler analyst okay very helpful and if i could just ask lastly on expense growth expectations for 2020 obviously some moving pieces with the sba team being on board for the full year in some additional hires so just any thoughts on maybe a quarterly run rate for 2020 kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer on the expense side kind of all in it s going to increase somewhat obviously with the investment in the sba i think probably i think the all in incremental expense once we have for 2020 with the hires assuming we keep to the schedule that we have that s probably going to add 3 million to the expense category kind of all in so i think probably where we re at today obviously first quarter you re going to have all of the beginning of the year resets on the employee side and we ll have a fully a full year s impact of other hires we made outside of sba this year as we ve continued to build out our teams in the it space and added to certain areas across the bank so it could probably maybe 12 5 to 13 over 12 5 to kind of running out to 13 5 over the course of the year but that s going to be just really dependent on timing of hires and that s probably i think that s probably on the higher side i think that s a conservative number nathan race piper sandler analyst okay great i appreciate all the color thank you david b becker president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question will come from john rodis of janney please go ahead sir john rodis janney analyst good afternoon guys david b becker president and chief executive officer hey john john rodis janney analyst hey the expected loan sale of 100 million in the first quarter so if i m thinking about that right so all things equal your loan portfolio is going to probably be down from in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter is that right david b becker president and chief executive officer it could very well be down yes down to neutral growth for the first quarter john rodis janney analyst okay okay and then ken that you keep saying modest growth for 2020 which i appreciate it does this sort of reading between the lines is modest mean is that low single digits in your mind kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes that s probably low low to mid single digits on asset growth john rodis janney analyst yes okay and then the loan sale gain in the fourth quarter of 1 7 million which was up nicely from the 523 000 in the third quarter yet you sold you sold a similar amount of loans i know there was roughly 9 million in sba but correct me if i m wrong but i don t think that sba piece drove the difference so why did you get better pricing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer well some of it had to do with the quality of the portfolios i mean we sold in the of the single tenant we sold three we sold three different transactions where we just we negotiated pretty solid pricing that was all above kind of in the range of 102 and higher one of the sales was under that in kind of the 101 101 in half range but that was a very low yielding pool that we sold which was a good trade from our perspective and then on the public finance side we also had gains there whereas maybe some prior quarters certain sales of public finance loans had been kind of legacy kind of 2017 type of originations prior to tax reform that were originated so the fte tax rate on those were quite as high as they would have been prior to tax reform where we sold them for par value or maybe a nominal loss whereas we sold some higher yielding stuff in public finance that we actually clip some nice premiums on when you break down that 1 7 million a million of that came from portfolio loans and the 700 000 that difference was in the sba space david b becker president and chief executive officer this is a heads up john and for the rest of year the 100 million portfolio sale that is coming up here latter part of january early part of february is a mortgage pool that was going to be pretty much at par there is not a big pick up on that but we are as i stated earlier getting rid of 100 million in assets that reyielding about a 370 glide and we ll replace them other part of it we ve been in the market long enough and we re but we have interest in the play we re able to sell most of these portfolios in the fourth quarter and what we re looking at here is the first part of the year we have no brokers in between and that helps good chunk of the yields that we re getting there the earnings were pick it up john rodis janney analyst okay fair enough thanks guys and then ken you said tce approaching high sevens 8 by the end of this year any thoughts on does that include any buyback activity or what are your thoughts today on buybacks guys david b becker president and chief executive officer yes that does not include buyback activity as of right now our board hasn t authorized a new repurchase plan i think our view on it is again as i ve used this term before it s a balancing act i we obviously want to continue building capital so i think probably the way that we re going to look at it is let s get through the first quarter and kind of see how trends look see what profitability looks like see with the balance sheet looks like and see how our forecast have changed if at all and revisit the topic then to see if we re able to build capital faster than we expect that will probably give us an opportunity to talk to the board about implementing a new repurchase plan john rodis janney analyst okay and then ken just on the provisioning obviously a pretty big drop in the fourth quarter relative to the first three quarters how should we sort of and obviously given the expected loan sales and so forth how should we think about provisioning going forward for this year for 20 kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer i think in general overall provisioning a couple of different levers on that i think provisioning in general should be lower than we ve had in the past just simply because poor overall portfolio growth is going to be much much less as loan sales helped to offset new originations so really you re period end portfolio at any given time is not going to probably show a lot of growth so i think historically we re probably without thinking about sba for a minute provisioning should be probably under well under 1 million a quarter now as david alluded to earlier with the growth in the sba the sba balances that are retained on the balance sheet those are going to be reserved at a higher level just simply because of the perceived risk with small business lending say as versus single tenant finance so that will kind of act as we add those balances to the balance sheet that will somewhat not offset the decline in provisioning due to balance sheet management but it will kind of increase the coverage ratio if you will over the course of the year now remember our goal here today is initially is to originate the guaranteed pieces of the 7 a loans which means for every dollar we originate we re only retaining 0 25 so sba balances will grow over the course of the year but certainly not to the extent that total originations do john rodis janney analyst okay so ken i just want to make sure i heard so you said you think less than 1 million a quarter but that excludes the impact from sba is that right kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that includes actually that includes the sba if you ramp it up by the end of the year to a little bit over 1 million but earlier in the year when we re still building balances there s just not that much of an impact because it s such a smaller part of the portfolio so for the first half of the year we expect provisioning to be below 1 million in the second half of the year it will be probably a little bit above 1 million a quarter john rodis janney analyst okay and then just one final question on the margin if you sort of look at the fourth quarter where did it end sort of in december did the margin end kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer above what the quarterly number was i mean we were probably we were in the low 170s in december david b becker president and chief executive officer we had a little bit of a dip in october john over what we were in september and then it improved in november and december both months saw improvement john rodis janney analyst okay super thanks guys kenneth j lovik executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thanks john operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to david becker for any closing remarks david b becker president and chief executive officer thank you we appreciate all of you taking time out today to join us for the

stanford in recent years the us government has taken several essential economic policy steps the tax reform embedded in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tcja the recent united states mexico canada usmca trade agreement phase one of a china us trade deal and recent regulatory reforms are all needed to revive and strengthen economic growth it is now time for another essential policy step correcting the trajectory of fiscal policy the congressional budget office s cbo current baseline projection of federal government spending in future years far outpaces federal government revenue as the figure below clearly shows the result is an exploding federal budget deficit which will bring the federal debt as a share of gdp to 144 per cent by 2049 according to the cbo baseline and likely to the 219 per cent projected in the cbo s alternative fiscal scenario these debt levels are unprecedented in us history in contrast to previous periods when the deficit fell after similar upward bursts the current cbo projections show no such reversal the large deficit will crowd out important federal programmes including needed infrastructure investment as well as private investment needed for economic growth debt service will account for a rising share of spending and the high debt will likely increase interest rates by more than the cbo assumes leading to an economically perilous debt spiral it does not have to be this way the figure also shows a sensible target for spending as a share of gdp establishing a path toward fiscal consolidation this target moves very gradually by only 0 1 percentage point per year reducing the share of federal spending in gdp from 20 7 per cent to 19 5 per cent this gradual path does not represent austerity in any meaningful sense federal spending would grow at a rate slightly less than the growth rate of gdp leading to smaller deficits over time if credible the plan would have no negative demand effects on gdp according to cbo research that i cited when i testified before the house budget committee in november such a target would lead to higher gdp growth and more income per person in contrast to current cbo projections of exploding deficits but achieving this target means that the future expenditure share of gdp would be substantially lower than projected by the cbo under current policy as john cogan explains in his recent book the high cost of good intentions consolidation paths like this require reforms that boost the efficiency of government programmes such as keeping the growth of social security spending per person in line with inflation some economists such as jason furman of harvard university s kennedy school have argued for another type of fiscal reform which would increase the magnitude of automatic stabilisers i disagree yes there are good reasons for the federal deficit to rise automatically during economic downturns and to fall during booms such movements tend to stabilise the economy and they occur automatically as a result of programmes like unemployment compensation and a progressive tax system but automatic stabilisers have been working well for many years regression estimates show that their recent size has been about the same as it has been for the past half century as real gdp declines relative to its potential that is as the output gap rises spending growth increases and tax revenue growth declines resulting in a larger cyclical deficit from 2000 to 2018 the output gap accounted for 38 per cent of the cyclical component of the deficit about the same as the 36 per cent share over the five decades from 1969 to 2018 based on data from the cbo s january 28 2019 report on the automatic stabilisers one can see this relationship in the scatter plot below showing the cyclical deficit and the gdp gap during 1969 2018 the dots are scattered tightly around a straight line with a slope of 0 36 one reason sometimes given to justify strengthening the automatic stabilisers is that monetary policy can no longer do the job because it is constrained by the zero bound on interest rates but it is better to fix monetary policy by using rules including rules for forward guidance than it is to change the automatic stabiliser component of fiscal policy when the problem lies elsewhere the current federal budget is off track and needs to be reformed the problem is that spending is projected to grow too rapidly relative to revenues not that the deficit responds too modestly to the ups and downs in the economy the reform suggested here would focus on the problem with a very gradual fiscal consolidation which would make the policy process more permanent pervasive and predictable most important it would both accelerate gdp growth and create a more resilient economy john b taylor is professor of economics at stanford university and senior fellow at stanford s hoover institution his most recent book with george p shultz is choose economic freedom project syndicate 2020 www project syndicate org
you ve probably noticed but sanctions against north korea are not working despite economic hardship kim jong un has doubled down on building north korea s nuclear arsenal and economic independence in an effort to turn the screws tighter on dec 20 2019 president donald trump signed into law the otto warmbier north korea nuclear sanctions and enforcement act of 2019 known more simply as the warmbier act as part of the 2020 national defense authorization act ndaa named after a u s student detained and allegedly tortured by north korean authorities before succumbing to his injuries this law expands u s unilateral sanctions against north korea and signals america s ongoing commitment to denuclearizing pyongyang through a campaign of maximum pressure to understand the state of play and why sanctions are failing it is important to take a close look at them understand the political context in which the warmbier act was introduced outline its major provisions and identify likely challenges in its implementation the politics of maximum pressure the u n sanctions regime against north korea is composed of 14 separate resolutions extending back 13 years these resolutions prohibit member states from a wide range of political military and economic engagement with north korea including trade in its largest import and export markets foreign direct investment arms sales financial services and scientific and technical cooperation to name a few despite the comprehensiveness of these u n measures they are supplemented with additional unilateral sanctions by various states including the united states european union japan and others including a complete u s trade embargo as this sanctions regime has grown however its implementation has proven challenging with recent u n panel of experts reports revealing that u n sanctions against north korea are subject to rampant violations veto wielding china and russia have also indicated that they will not support further u n sanctions against north korea and have even advocated the withdrawal of certain sanctions instruments waning support for sanctions in international quarters has been matched by a noticeable shift away from the policy of maximum pressure by the trump administration as part of the president s wheedling diplomacy with kim he has made major concessions in sanctions implementation including withholding hundreds of designations for north korean entities in the run up to the singapore summit the u s treasury headed secretary steven mnuchin has similarly backed down from going after chinese banks implicated in north korean money laundering ostensibly due to concerns about pushback from beijing facing declining interest in maximum pressure at home and abroad the u s congress is pushing through new unilateral sanctions instruments designed to ramp up pressure on the executive branch and other states to implement sanctions including the warmbier act which explicitly restates the u s commitment to maximum pressure in its preamble significantly these new u s instruments are increasingly legislating secondary sanctions unlike primary sanctions which directly punish a target for its transgressions secondary sanctions punish third parties for their engagement with the primary target the logic of secondary sanctions is to encourage third parties to cut ties with the primary target further isolating the target and amplifying the effects of primary sanctions in the case of the united states secondary sanctions usually involve threatening to cut third parties access to the u s financial system unless they cut ties with primary u s sanctions targets the power of the u s financial system means that these third parties foreign banks traders insurers etc have little choice but to comply even when their actions are lawful unsurprisingly u s secondary sanctions have proven controversial amongst adversaries and allies alike with charges of economic imperialism coming with this targeting of non u s entities enter the warmbier act there are three primary additions to u s sanctions contained within the warmbier act the first is an expansion of u s secondary sanctions targeting foreign financial institutions engaged in commerce with north korean linked designated entities the law requires that any foreign financial institution that provides significant financial services to any north korean linked u s designated entity be subject to asset freezes and or a ban on correspondent payable through accounts with american banks the latter being an effective severance from the u s financial system along with associated civil and criminal penalties in effect under this provision any financial institution anywhere in the world that provides financial services to a north korean linked entity designated by the united states risks losing access to the world s largest economy and a ban on u s dollar transactions which would typically have catastrophic implications for profitability and liquidity this emphasis on targeting foreign financial institutions appears to be a response to recent panel of experts reports that identified financial sanctions as some of the most poorly implemented and actively evaded measures of the sanctions regime sen chris van hollen a sponsor of the warmbier act had similarly described financial sanctions as kind of like swiss cheese there s a lot of leakage in this though significant provisions in and of themselves these financial measures were largely pre empted by the korean interdiction and modernization of sanctions act august 2017 and executive order 13810 september 2017 which mandated similar punishments for foreign financial institutions that knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant transaction either a on behalf of a u s designated individual b in support of particular north korean industries such as mining and transport or c in connection with trade with north korea the latter removing any conditionalities regarding individual parties to the transaction the second addition is the expansion of u s powers to designate entities that engage with north korea or its agents united states designated entities being prohibited from dealings with u s persons and selectively subjected to secondary sanctions under past acts and executive orders a suite of designatable offences have been legislated for example facilitating the transfer of controlled goods to north korea engaging in illicit north korean activities such as narcotics trafficking or currency counterfeiting and contributing to north korean wmd development under this legislative framework some 400 persons corporations banks vessels and government agencies principally based in north korea and china have been designated by the united states the warmbier act expands the range of offences subject to mandatory designation to include trading in north korea s largest import and export markets coal textiles seafood etc facilitating the exportation or employment of north korean labor providing north korea with vessels or facilitating the voyage at sea of north korean vessels insurance flag registration etc by designating entities engaged in such activities the united states is ostensibly aiming to stem north korea s remaining revenue streams in particular the sale of minerals seafood and textiles which together make up over 75 percent of north korea s export revenue the third addition of the warmbier act is a renewed pressure on foreign governments to ensure sanctions implementation within their jurisdictions this pressure comes in two forms first a policy of opposing the provision of development assistance by international financial institutions the international monetary fund asian development bank etc to foreign governments that knowingly failed to adequately enforce sanctions under an applicable united nations security council resolution and second new internal reporting requirements assessing the extent of sanctions compliance by foreign governments the implication of these provisions is that states that drag their heels on sanctions implementation against north korea will jeopardize their access to development assistance and put themselves in the crosshairs for further u s action be it designations démarches or some other deterioration in its politico economic relationship with the united states it s also possible that congress intended these internal reporting requirements to raise awareness in relevant domestic political units of gaps in the implementation of sanctions against north korea thereby placing upward pressure on the executive to more aggressively exercise the powers granted to it by this and previous legislation to strengthen implementation at home and abroad from this perspective section 7129 is especially telling as it requires the treasury to provide additional reporting on north korean sanctions evasion along with legislative and administrative recommendations for improving sanctions enforcement this adds additional political weight to further inaction by the executive on implementing sanctions it s no longer just idle foreign policy it s ignoring recommendations from the treasury challenges in implementation while the warmbier act ostensibly bolsters america s maximum pressure campaign against north korea it also contains two noticeable shortcomings that are likely to undermine its overall effectiveness firstly though the warmbier act comes with a raft of mandatory provisions the extent to which they are applied is likely to be diminished by carefully crafted waivers and weasel words that grant u s authorities the space to withhold punishments where it is expedient to do so for example secondary sanctions measures restricting foreign financial institutions access to u s correspondent and payable through accounts can range from outright prohibition to the imposition of strict conditions with no guidance offered as to what conditions are sufficiently strict in another example mandatory designations for the transfer of coal seafood textiles etc only apply when the entity knowingly transfers significant quantities of the good as per the determination of the president these are vague standards subject to political interpretation and even where they are met section 7143 grants the president the power to suspend any provision of the warmbier act if the suspension is vital to the national security interests of the united states a benchmark that is poorly defined and highly subjective this wiggle room is likely to be exploited by u s authorities in particular the executive as above that wish to avoid more politically or economically challenging applications of those sanctions undermining the pursuit of maximum pressure further such uncertainty in enforcement weakens the normative power of this sanctions instrument that is the less certainty of punishment that entities generally face for violating sanctions the less aggressively they will self regulate to meet their compliance requirements a second challenge to implementing the warmbier act and one that has bedeviled the sanctions regime against north korea since its inception is in building sanctions implementation capacity in foreign implementors while there are some entities for which the subversion of sanctions against north korea is a matter of policy in the majority of cases sanctions evasion occurs because smaller entities banks importers exporters flag registries etc simply lack the capacity to meet the best practice levels demanded by a multifaceted and increasingly complex sanctions regime particularly given the sophistication of north korean sanctions busting tradecraft the warmbier act acknowledges this limitation in two ways firstly waivers for sanctions implementation are offered on the basis of capacity gaps section 7124 for example allows the opposition to development assistance on the basis of non implementation of north korean sanctions to be withheld if that failure is due exclusively to a lack of capacity on the part of the foreign government and secondly the act advocates for increased international funding to build sanctions implementation capacity section 7125 for example compels the american executive director r at the international monetary fund to campaign for increasing the share of the fund s administrative budget allocated to technical assistance for member states in strengthening anti money laundering capabilities while the latter provision is a sensible first step in addressing a root cause of sanctions evasion a greater share of the organization s administrative budget presuming that the united states can secure this is on its own unlikely to meet the complex requirements of ensuring best practice across a wide array of sanctions implementors in diverse national contexts what to do with north korea now at the precipice of a way to reliably hit the united states with nuclear weapons perhaps more than one washington should finally and firmly decide whether it is willing to live with a nuclear armed north korea if the answer is yes the united states ought to shift from a policy of denuclearization to threat reduction to avoid the risk of undue escalation and nuclear war sanctions should be lifted diplomatic efforts redoubled and concessions entertained on contentious issues in north korean relations such as military deployments in south korea the united states should also begin developing policies to manage the strategic costs of a de facto nuclear north korea including damage to the sanctity of the non proliferation regime diminished regional u s alliance credibility the threat of nuclear dominos in northeast asia and the risks of north korean horizontal proliferation if the answer is no then washington ought to get serious and soon about wrenching nuclear weapons from north korea for strategic and domestic political reasons north korea will never voluntarily forfeit its nuclear weapons north korea s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs are now advanced enough that limited strikes on critical nuclear facilities will not be enough to irreversibly damage to its nuclear capabilities and regime change through military intervention is not feasible due to the likelihood of chinese military support for pyongyang and the kim regime s ability to damage regional u s interests through military force to include weapons of mass destruction therefore as unsatisfying as it might be maximum pressure could be the only path to denuclearizing north korea and yet its efficacy is being undermined by a lack of commitment from the executive without a firm commitment to maximize u s pressure on north korea the best that one could hope for is incremental additions to u s sanctions commensurate with whatever upwards pressure congress can muster through legislation such as the warmbier act hoping that each new round of marginal sanctions will be the straw that breaks the camel s back alternatively the united states can commit to its declaratory policy and go after the big chinese banks laundering north korean money aggressively designate foreign facilitators of north korea s remaining revenue streams and provide for a stronger program of capacity building for sanctions implementation in foreign states all powers enjoyed by the president and secretary of the treasury under existing legislation the foreshadowed deterioration in u s north korean relations might be the shot in the arm that the executive needs to get serious about bringing the hammer down on north korea dr christopher j watterson is a research associate at king s college london where he specializes

each year leftist democrats socialists and radicals are asked to hold their noses and vote for the lesser of two evils this is a false choice because we live in a rigged one party state a plutocracy run by the business party a syndicate with democratic and republican wings syndicate is the proper word for our corrupt one party system because there is no real choice only the appearance of choice we are onlookers cheering for the villain or the babyface in a pro wrestling spectacle we call elections orchestrated by a complicit mass media we must open our eyes to this facade for the first revolutionary act is to call things by their true name rosa luxemburg at both the state and national levels the candidates offered up by the syndicate are corporate funded purveyors of empire whose primary loyalty is to the investor class that funds them in fact the only requirement the syndicate makes on their candidates is that they are capable of raising massive amounts of money from corporations or the corporate rich to ensure they have the blessing of the investor class there are no requirements on morality voting record or policy positions within the business party syndicate mark twain was correct when he wrote it could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native criminal class except congress this corruption is as true today as it was 150 years ago and the higher that one is elevated in the party wings of the syndicate the more fundraising dominates their time and focus it is this process that transforms politicians who might initially believe they can honestly represent the public into marketers whose role is to convince the public that there is no alternative to the capitalist system or the policies written by corporate funded think tanks corruption is not an anomaly but an essential element in the functioning of managed democracy sheldon wolin in addition to fundraising rising in the party power structure requires adherence to the status quo ideology of the washington consensus to obtain backing in the syndicate candidates must first profess a belief in american mythology that the u s is the indispensable country a benevolent force where americans are innocent in our hostilities that capitalism is the only method for organizing an economy that free markets and free trade function without government help and benefit all that inequality is a natural state in a meritocracy and that growth is necessary one must also show fealty to the pentagon and arms industry to the financial interests of wall street and to multinational corporate interests martin luther king jr saw it clearly it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism the problem of economic exploitation and the problem of war are all tied together these are the triple evils that are interrelated fealty to the syndicate translates to support for endless wars oil subsidies bank bailouts free trade agreements environmental exploitation and coups against any country that fails to embrace neoliberal ideology this fealty also translates to lower wages increased health care costs poorer schools soaring housing costs growing homelessness and massive student debt it doesn t matter which wing of the syndicate the candidate chooses to join they must embrace the core mythology designed to maximize corporate profits and if voting made any difference they d make it illegal emma goldman the continued lesser of two evils voting by the left has facilitated 50 years of neoliberal policies that have created the highest level of wealth inequality that the u s has ever seen and a series of endless wars instigated and perpetuated by both wings of the syndicate einstein stated insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results so why do leftists continue to behave in this manner have we forgotten that he who chooses for the lesser evil all too readily forgets having chosen evil hannah arendt why do we continue to vote for false choice candidates that move us farther and farther into a hegemonic empire of bases occupying the world to answer this question and envision a path forward we must first understand the history and nature of the corruption and then ask what can be done differently we begin by acknowledging that u s representative government was designed by the founding fathers to ensure that the wealthy slave owning elite controlled the state james madison wrote landholders ought to have a share in the government to support these invaluable interests and to balance and check the other they ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority the senate therefore ought to be this body and to answer these purposes they ought to have permanency and stability representative government was never designed to be democratic it was purposely designed to be anti democratic in order to partner with property owners and assist their crimes of asset theft primarily through slavery and land stolen from indigenous nations early on the mythology of white supremacy was intertwined with our other mythologies of capitalism meritocracy and rugged individualism to hide this immoral theft this piracy together these myths act as a social glue that justifies the inequalities apparent throughout society this mythology still blinds most whites to various forms of institutional racism racialized mass incarceration being the most obvious understanding the foundation of capitalism requires a consideration of the hidden abode of race the ontological distinction between superior and inferior humans codified as race that was necessary for slavery colonialism the theft of lands in the americas and genocide michael c dawson racism and impoverishment are the nature of our capitalist system neoliberal mythology developed over the last 50 years is just the latest form of propaganda used to justify a system that uses racist oppression to control and rob us of our labor our assets and our dignity but this early system of government designed to partner with slavery has evolved into a system designed to partner with corporations representative institutions no longer represent voters instead they have been short circuited steadily corrupted by an institutionalized system of bribery that renders them responsive to powerful interest groups whose constituencies are the major corporations and wealthiest americans the courts in turn when they are not increasingly handmaidens of corporate power are consistently deferential to the claims of national security elections have become heavily subsidized non events that typically attract at best merely half of an electorate whose information about foreign and domestic politics is filtered through corporate dominated media citizens are manipulated into a nervous state by the media s reports of rampant crime and terrorist networks by thinly veiled threats of the attorney general and by their own fears about unemployment what is crucially important here is not only the expansion of governmental power but the inevitable discrediting of constitutional limitations and institutional processes that discourages the citizenry and leaves them politically apathetic sheldon wolin democracy incorporated we now live in a system of inverted totalitarianism this is not classical totalitarianism where a strong leader seizes power paraphrasing wolin today our leaders are products of a system a system gradually created that retains old myths it values corporate power over the public good the economy dominates the political and it uses economic instability to generate passivity in a demobilized society the system is designed to seize the assets of the poor and funnel them to the rich and then criminalize the poor to cover up the theft we citizens are complicit in this process by accepting a passive spectator role we are no longer involved in setting policy or choosing potential leaders and a captured intelligentsia offers a false utopian vision while the ruling elite manage democracy we are apolitical subjects not citizens fixed irrevocably in childhood hoping that the leader messiah will bring us to salvation however there are moments when the public recognizes that they have been deceived that the system is broken and corrupt at these times our political leaders offer a salve of technical fixes using the obtuse language of economics to obscure both the reality of the problems and the cause and when all else fails they blame the bureaucrats of government rather than the beneficiaries of government corruption and largess in this system of managed democracy the two major parties are very protective of their monopoly over us politics should any third party begin to gain a significant following that could compete with either party in the polls they will make common cause in attacking and bringing about the dismantlement of the third party steve martinot internal reform of the business party syndicate or either wing of that syndicate is prevented by the structure that governs promotion within each wing a structure that is based upon fundraising from powerful corporations should any leftist candidate manage to bypass the corporate controlled gates via small donation fundraising they are either destroyed via redistricting or from direct personal attacks by corporate funded think tanks and corporate owned mass media examples of the former are anti war rep dennis kucinich while examples of the latter are too numerous to list recent examples of these attacks include those on rep tulsi gabbard for her anti war position rep alexandria ocasio cortez for her green new deal and rep ilhan omar for criticizing israel when you examine the arc of history since wwii there is a consistency between the two wings of the syndicate on both foreign and domestic policy it is clear that our one party criminal system is designed to fund the military industrial complex to support big oil so as to maintain the u s petrodollar as the global currency and to destroy any liberation movements that threaten corporate profits and u s hegemony manifestations of this syndicate include the endless wars for control of oil coups carried out by the cia to eliminate socialist programs embargoes imposed on any countries that do not submit to neoliberal monetary policies and the creation of a surveillance and police state to crush any dissent at home members of both wings of the syndicate have judiciously carried out these actions tens of millions of people have been sacrificed by the syndicate over the past decades in order to maintain u s hegemony and we a docile public are complicit in these acts we need to understand that this ruthless clinging to power at all costs is no different than what is seen in other criminal syndicates there appear to be no moral limits to the syndicate s piracy including accelerating the global climate crisis to maintain power this latter policy of the syndicate is apparent in both wings with obama s all of the above energy policy and trump s climate change denials u s hegemony and corporate profits depend on controlling the global demand for oil and the syndicate cannot allow any policy that is a threat to this power including the green new deal most environmentalists still do not understand this and assume they can work within the system they have been fooled media manipulation has produced an expectation that the democratic wing of the syndicate will adopt environmental policies to avoid this disaster unfortunately it s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled mark twain manipulation of americans by limiting the dialogue allowed around political problems and by only giving voice to a narrow range of solutions acceptable to the syndicate is a key element in maintaining manufactured democracy this control is accomplished with commercial and social media organized by a handful of corporations that use divide and conquer propaganda techniques honed over the last century to sow fear racism xenophobia and misogyny the planning and propaganda centers for the globalist policies that maintain this control are the decentralized corporate funded think tanks whose mission is to maintain us hegemony protect global capital and defend neoliberal social policies of austerity within this system of propaganda political campaigns work to construct an image least offensive to their wealthy benefactors and to the voters this image is then marketed to us noam chomsky writes it is important to bear in mind that political campaigns are designed by the same people who sell toothpaste and cars voters are bombarded with messages both from the not so independent corporate media and by political campaigns who now tailor their individualized messaging based on your facebook and google profiles in this sea of propaganda the voter is left to choose between coke and pepsi or during the 2016 presidential campaign between caligula and nero and by voting for members of the syndicate we give tacit approval to a corrupt system that robs us of our power our assets our labor and our freedoms what does it mean to choose between candidates that are incapable of addressing the primary existential threats to humanity namely climate change and war what does it mean to choose between candidates who are guaranteed to favor wall street over main street what does it mean to choose between candidates that will continue to pursue policies designed by corporations that remove the last safety nets we have for health education food security housing and retirement by choosing between the syndicate candidates are we collaborating with a system that perpetuates economic and social inequality controlled by an ever growing military and police surveillance state can lesser of two evil voting be justified in such a system does such participation indicate consent in a system of injustice is there a way to break the cycle all attempts to reform the one party system over the past four decades have proved futile due to the structural reasons described above in fact corporate control of the syndicate has strengthened any efforts to work within the corrupted structure and that deviate from the syndicate s washington consensus are crushed attempts thus far to run a non syndicate candidate in a winner take all election system have been futile both due to lesser of two evils voting which causes small party candidates to be ignored or on the rare occasion when an outsider wins because individual representatives within that system have no power what is especially needed now is an effort to build something outside this system something outside of the control of corporate money let s call this something the movement just to give it a name the movement must be broad based and inclusive to face off against the syndicate therefore it must combine all the issues that the left struggle against no one issue can dominate this uniting is possible because all the political struggles have a common enemy namely the syndicate which is too powerful for any subset of organizations to challenge in addition all the various political objectives of the left preventing war and climate change ending oppression and racism promoting democratic participation ending corporate control preventing environmental degradation dismantling capitalism providing affordable health care and education and ending poverty are all intertwined with the power structure of the syndicate and because the syndicate controls the current power structure it will not allow any challenges to its power within that structure the movement must be built outside that system and in such a manner that the syndicate is unable to control or destroy it so what form can the movement take and what role can existing progressive and leftist organizations have with regards to the movement first the left must acknowledge that all political organizations that currently exist will be unsuccessful in achieving their objectives if they require defeating the core objectives of the syndicate for example any organizations attempting to impact policy as regards global climate change will fail because syndicate power relies on maintaining an oil based economy and control of that oil maintains petrodollar hegemony it doesn t matter that this syndicate control will result in the deaths of billions of people because the syndicate s corporate machine structure will eliminate any member whose primary concern is not maintaining syndicate power alternatively any attempts to reduce global poverty and inequality will fail because syndicate profits depend on that exploitation and any attempts to move away from endless war will fail because the syndicate s control and profits depend on the maintaining a growing military industrial complex any targeted efforts at change will never be powerful enough only a combined effort that involves all leftist interests with massive participation can be successful and any organizations who choose to focus on a narrow set of goals rather than topple the syndicate will fail over time and slowly become more concerned with maintaining their operations rather than reaching their goal which would eliminate their reason for existence in fact such behavior can now be seen in many leftist or progressive organizations with many environmental organizations fully captured and beholden to corporate funding so what can organizations do to build the movement first they must be willing to sacrifice their narrow political interests to the larger goals of the movement this should be declared openly and their education programs must address the interconnectedness of all our political problems they must also identify the primary driver of these problems namely the business party syndicate with its democratic and republican wings organizations must focus on community building of democratic structures outside the syndicate s control organizations should spend little time on election related issues except as outreach to educate and draw in others to the movement and should instead focus on building coalitions with other groups organizations must emphasize bottom up democratic operations that build solidarity and interconnections with other organizations the movement will need to develop its own internal super structure that is independent of the old systems of power with safeguards to prevent power consolidation and disruption by the syndicate and the movement must wait till it reaches a critical mass of people capable of challenging the business party syndicate before it wields its political power so what can be done by individuals now while the path to building the movement is unclear a first step is to do anything one can to disempower the syndicate one way is to demonstrate that your loyalty is not to the business party by registering to vote with a non corporate party no party preference fails to do this since this does not demonstrate interest in building an alternative to the syndicate second vote for candidates who are not members of the syndicate and who are not from corporate funded parties third form local groups to discuss the history and structure of the syndicate so we understand what we are up against fourth join leftist organizations and begin a dialogue about the interconnected nature of all our social problems and the need to unite against a common enemy namely the syndicate fifth in building the movement we must focus on the ideology and vision that will unite us and not on candidate or leader personalities sixth building the movement means doing the hard work of community outreach and education and in particular getting outside one s comfort zone this will include defending those who are attacked by the syndicate and providing the needed economic and educational support to those communities who join the movement seventh dialogue is critical so all members of the movement must work to develop critical thinking and listening skills training must include recognition of the various propaganda techniques that the syndicate will attempt to use to divide us we live in capitalism its power seems inescapable so did the divine right of kings any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings ursula le guin therefore start doing the work to build the movement today so we can do away with the corrupt business party syndicate which is now the greatest existential threat humanity has ever experienced don t be fooled into thinking that participation in elections means that we really have a choice or that this is democracy your choices are extremely limited and will not change the system nor will they help avert disaster this can only be done by building the movement and taking back our power from corporations he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it he who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it martin luther king jr dr james mcfadden is a research physicist at the university of california berkeley for the past dozen years he has studied economics political history psychology racism and climate change he now spends most of his time as a political organizer working with the green party and other organizations on issues of democracy and social

of today s financial presentation is available on our investor relations homepage and webcast page at www moog com john john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer thanks ann good morning thanks for joining us this morning we report on the first quarter of fiscal 20 and fine tune our guidance for the full year overall it was a strong start to our new fiscal year in terms of both sales and operating performance this quarter i m adopting a new approach to the headlines first offering some macroeconomic comments followed by some microeconomic thoughts and then focusing on what s going on inside our company first from a macroeconomic perspective there is more clarity around both brexit and the us trade dispute with china than there was a quarter ago while neither situation has significant direct impact on our business the additional clarity should help stabilize the global economy and be positive for both our industrial and commercial aircraft businesses longer term on the defense side the continued unrest in the middle east suggests a reduction in overseas us overseas activities is not imminent which supports our thesis for continued strong defense spending second within our industry sectors there have been developments in both our commercial aircraft and industrial markets the uncertainty around the boeing 737 max return to service has increased while the potential addition of simulator training requirements for max pilots has also emerged on the industrial side the economic climate in europe has continue to weaken particularly in germany and our team there believes we ve not yet seen the bottom in the defense markets excluding developments in the middle east the underlying narrative concerning near peer rivals in china and russia has not changed and spending priorities remain stable third it was a good quarter for our business sales were up 11 operating profit was up 14 and earnings per share were up 18 during the quarter we witnessed the first flight of the embraer e2 175 using all moog flight controls and our medical manufacturing facility in costa rica received a prestigious national awards for operational excellence we completed the acquisition of an industrial manufacturing company in germany which further strengthens our market leadership position in rotating devices we refinanced our debt structure reducing our interest rates and providing additional capital deployment flexibility our balance sheet is now nicely set up for the next several years and provides us with tremendous flexibility in how we allocate capital to create value for our shareholders finally in the quarter we repurchased 670 000 shares under our outstanding authorization and then lastly our colleagues and friends don fishback decided to retire at the end of our first quarter don spent 38 years with our company in various finance functions spending the last nine years of his career as cfo he was a wonderful cfo great business advisor and personal friend i will miss him as well many of our listeners who have known don he continue as a director of moog our new cfo is jennifer walter who s been with moog almost 20 years as controller and more recently as vice president of finance she will do an excellent job taking over from don now let me move to the details starting with the first quarter results sales in the quarter of 755 million were 11 higher than last year driven by strong organic growth particularly in our a d portfolio sales were up in each of our operating groups with space and defense up 19 aircraft up 12 and industrial up 4 over last year taking a look at the p l our gross margin was down from last year on a less favorable mix r d was down on lower aircraft spend while sg a was lower as a percentage of sales interest expense was up slightly on higher debt levels in other income we had a benefit of about 2 million last year as a result of the sale of a small product line excluding this unusual item the other income line is flat with last year the effective tax rate this quarter was 25 2 resulting in net income of 50 million up 17 from last year and earnings per share of 1 44 up 18 on a slightly lower share count fiscal 20 outlook our forecast for operating performance is unchanged from 90 days ago however we re making two minor adjustments to our full year outlook to reflect events in the first quarter which we had not forecasted first we re increasing our sales forecast by 35 million to account for the sales of the gat acquisition in our industrial group given first year acquisition accounting impacts we re modeling this business to be breakeven in fiscal 20 second we re adjusting our eps forecast to include the combined impact of calling our high yield bonds and the first quarter share buyback activity the net impact is a 0 05 reduction in our eps forecast the overall result is full year sales of 3 05 billion and earnings per share of 5 50 plus or minus 0 20 now to the segments i d remind our listeners that we ve provided a two page supplemental data package posted on our webcast site which provides all of the detailed numbers for your model we suggest you follow this in parallel with the text beginning with aircraft q1 sales in the quarter of 340 million were 12 higher than last year on the military side we enjoyed good growth in both the oem and aftermarket portfolio oem sales on foreign platforms were up nicely in the quarter while f 35 sales to lockheed were down slightly after a very strong first quarter last year for the full year we anticipate oem sales on the f 35 will be up 17 over last year in the military aftermarket sales in the quarter were up across much of the portfolio led by strong f 35 growth as the fleet of f 35 airplanes in service continues to grow our aftermarket activity will grow accordingly in fiscal 20 we re forecasting the f 35 aftermarket to be more than twice the level it was just two years ago on the commercial side sales were also up nicely from last year albeit less than on the military side oem sales to both boeing and airbus were up double digits our boeing book of business was up on higher 787 sales the results of timing of orders sales on the 737 platform were down marginally from last year sales to airbus were up on the a350 program with the remainder of the airbus programs down slightly sales into the commercial aftermarkets were more or less in line with last year with slightly higher 787 activity compensating for slightly lower a350 sales aircraft fiscal 20 we re keeping our full year sales forecast unchanged from 90 days ago at 1 33 billion up 2 from fiscal 19 we re planning for 7 growth in the military portfolio led by strong f 35 activity but slightly lower commercial activity on reduced 787 and a350 oem sales given the present uncertainty around the 737 max production rates we re not adjusting our sales forecast for that program as yet until we know more aircraft margins margin in the quarter of 11 4 were a good start to the year this quarter we benefited from the unusually high level of sales on foreign programs as well as relatively low expenses these effects will normalize as we move through subsequent quarters so we re maintaining our full year margin forecast at 10 5 our operations 2 0 initiative continues to make steady progress and as we ve said in the past we should start to see the impact on both cashflow and margins toward the back half of fiscal 20 turning now to space and defense sales in the first quarter of 186 million were 19 higher than last year driven by strong growth across both our space and defense markets sales into space applications were up 25 in the quarter as that market returns to healthy growth in fiscal 20 sales were up in our each of our core markets of launch satellites and special missions the growth was led by our development programs for thrust vector control and launch vehicles as well as work on various nasa programs in the defense market sales continue to be strong across most of the portfolio missile sales are up on continued high levels of production on our legacy platforms and increased development work on hypersonics vehicle sales were up on stronger domestic and european activity while sales of our general components into a wide variety of end applications were up over 20 space and defense fiscal 20 we re leaving our forecast for the year unchanged from 90 days ago full year sales of 770 million will be up 13 from last year a combination of 16 growth in space and 11 growth in defense sales all organic margins space and defense margins in the quarter of 13 6 were strong and a good start to the year compared to last year higher sales a slightly improved gross margin and some favorable timing on certain expense lines resulted in almost 200 basis points of margin expansion over the next three quarters spending in r d and selling will gradually increase so for the full year we re keeping our margin forecast unchanged at 13 now to industrial systems sales in the first quarter of 229 million were up 4 from last year we had strong sales growth into medical applications on higher enteral pump and set activity sales into our other three markets of energy industrial automation and simulation and test were more or less in line with last year energy sales were marginally up on offshore oil production activity while sales into industrial automation applications were slightly lower as anticipated we re seeing weakness in this business in central europe as the german economy continues to struggle finally sales into flight simulation applications were up but sales into the test market were down in both auto and aero applications at the end of november we completed the acquisition of gat a privately owned german company which specializes in fluid rotary unions or fru s these are devices which are used to carry fluids across rotating interfaces and are used in a wide range of industrial applications from machine tools to off shore oil exploration we re already the world s leader in slip ring technology which are devices used to carry electrical power and signals across rotating interfaces slip rings and fluid rotary unions are complementary technologies and are often used in the same applications the acquisition of gat opens new markets to moog and enhances our competitive position at some of our existing slip ring customers gat sales for fiscal 20 should be 35 million industrial systems fiscal 20 we re adjusting our full year sales forecast to account for the acquired sales of gat these additional sales are within the industrial automation markets we re also refining our outlook for both simulation and test and medical given the slowing global economy we believe our test sales will be 10 million lower while the strength in our medical end markets particularly for our enteral products will deliver 10 million of additional sales the net result is full year sales of 950 million industrial margins in the quarter of 11 7 were down from last year but in line with our plans for the year in the first quarter of fiscal 19 we completed the sale the sale of a small product line which contributed just over 100 basis points of operating margin the acquisition of gat will contribute 35 million of additional sales but given the impact of first year accounting adjustments we re modeling no additional operating profit therefore for the full year we re keeping our forecast for operating profit unchanged at 106 million but moderating the margin forecast slightly for the higher sales to 11 1 summary guidance q1 was a strong start to fiscal 20 sales were up 11 against a plan of 5 growth for the full year operating margin is ahead of our full year forecast and earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance our defense business continues to show real strength across the complete portfolio and our space business is back to strong growth after a flat year in 2019 space is benefiting from the additional us defense spending as well as the ramp up of activities at nasa to get back to the moon in the next four years commercial aircraft had nice growth in the quarter at our major oem customers although the aftermarket was off slightly from last year uncertainty around the max return to service increased during the quarter but it s too early for us to model the impact yet on our full year results overall commercial is on track for a year in which we re modeling a slight decrease in total sales from fiscal 19 due to the slowdown in some of our legacy programs finally industrial sales in the quarter of almost 230 million are in line with the run rate for the year excluding the impact of the acquired sales from gat we ve been modeling a flat year for industrial compared to fiscal 19 but should now see about 3 growth from the acquisition we believe the pattern of the first quarter will repeat over the coming quarters with strong medical sales compensating for continuing softness in our industrial automation business taken all together we re pleased with our first quarter start to the year we re keeping our outlook for the full year unchanged with minor adjustments for the acquired sales of gat and the impact of our financing activities our first quarter benefited from some positive timing on various defense contracts as well as a slower ramp up of expense spending than we had anticipated as our hiring catches up with our growth plans expenses should come back into line with our forecast and in addition the favorable timing of orders and shipments we enjoyed in the first quarter will unwind somewhat over the balance of the year opportunities to do better include further growth in our defense business although the availability of talent to meet the needs remains a constraint in addition our operational initiatives at aircraft could show positive results ahead of plan risks include the uncertainty around the max return to service as well as a further deterioration in the industrial climate as always we try to provide a balanced view which weighs both the upside opportunities and the downside risks for the second quarter we expect earnings per share of 1 30 plus or minus 0 10 now let me pass you to jennifer who will provide more color on our cash flow and balance sheet jennifer walter vice president and chief financial officer thank you john good morning everyone it was an excellent quarter for our balance sheet we refinanced the debt portion of our capital structure in the first quarter and we are now very nicely positioned to deploy capital that will create value for our shareholders in the coming years during october we extended the term of our 1 1 billion us revolving credit facility through october 2024 and obtained more favorable terms this facility also has an accordion feature to facilitate up to 400 million of expansion should we be looking for that capacity in the future we also extended our securitization program through october of 2021 this program effectively increases our borrowing capacity and lowers our interest rate on up to 130 million of borrowings then in december we issued 500 million of 4 25 senior notes with an eight year maturity in conjunction with the issuance we called our outstanding 300 million of 5 25 senior notes and incurred a call premium of 4 million we completed this redemption in january we re pleased to have this solid debt structure fully in place we expect our interest expense in 2020 to be 39 million the same amount we had in 2019 as higher outstanding borrowings are offset by lower interest rates as of quarter end we had both sets of senior notes outstanding and just 50 million outstanding on the us revolving credit facility we also had 127 million of cash at quarter end compared to 93 million a quarter ago the increase resulted from the timing associated with our debt refinancing activities free cash flow in the first quarter was 15 million that s a conversion ratio of 30 we had expected a slow start for free cash flow generation in the first half of 2020 we are still forecasting a full year conversation ratio of 80 or 152 million of free cash flow we ll pick up in the back half of the year as we start to see the benefit associated with our efforts to improve our operational processes net working capital excluding cash and debt as a percentage of sales at the end of q1 was 28 8 compared with 27 9 a quarter ago the increase largely reflects the growth in physical inventories we ve experienced capital expenditures in the first quarter were 27 million while depreciation and amortization totaled 22 million we re forecasting a slight ramp up in both capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization as we progress through the year for all of 2020 we re forecasting 120 million of capital expenditures and 91 million of depreciation and amortization capital expenditures in 2020 will be about 4 of sales which is at the high end of our historical spending range we re working on various facility expansion projects and we re investing in machinery and test equipment as part of our operational improvement activities the 15 million of free cash flow for q1 compares with an increase in our net debt of 110 million the 125 million difference includes share repurchases during the first quarter we repurchased 670 000 shares at an average price of 88 for a total of 59 million as is our typical practice we ll report on any future share repurchase activity when we report out on our next earnings call we also paid 54 million for the acquisition of gat and 9 million for the quarterly dividend our leverage ratio which is net debt divided by ebitda increased to 2 3 times from 2 1 times a quarter ago net debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 39 up from 36 last quarter shifting over to taxes our effective tax rate was 25 2 in the first quarter compared to 24 3 in the same period a year ago the lower rate a year ago included the benefit associated with utilizing tax loss carryforwards associated with the gain on a divested business cash contributions to our global retirement plans totaled 10 million in the quarter compared to 9 million in the first quarter of 2019 we plan to make contributions of 42 million in 2020 up from 37 million in 2019 global retirement plan expense in the first quarter was 18 million up from 17 million in the first quarter of 2019 total expense for 2020 is expected to be 74 million compared to 72 million in 2019 we made an accounting change in the first quarter that reduces our pension expense volatility the change relates to how we value certain assets in our us defined benefit plan in 2018 we made significant contributions and fully funded that plan accordingly we rebalanced the investment portfolio such that we had 80 liability hedging securities providing an economic hedge the changes in fair value of these assets will now flow through the income statement annually rather than being smooth over time and this reduces the volatility we re exposed to in our income statement our previous guidance for 2020 already considered this new principle this change does require retroactive application so we ve updated our 2019 numbers it affects non service pension cost so operating profit is not affected first quarter 2019 earnings per share are now 0 03 lower than previously reported for all of 2019 our earnings per share will be 0 15 lower than previously reported in our 10 k we re in really good shape from a capital perspective having completed the refinancing activities in the first quarter regarding capital deployment we will continue to take a disciplined approach toward strategic acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and dividends this morning we announced our quarterly cash dividend of 0 25 per share payable to our shareholders as john described we re off to a strong start for the year and we re looking forward to the rest of 2020 we expect to top the 3 billion mark in sales this year and achieve double digit growth in earnings per share with that we ll turn it back to john for any questions you may have john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer thanks jennifer carrie we re open for questions please questions and answers operator thank you and our first question will be from cai von rumohr with cowen cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst terrific thank you very much and very nice quarter so john max are you still running at 42 per month and given it s likely that you as along with all the others are going to see something of a dip what can you do to kind of mitigate the fact that if the rate goes down do you keep the people or do you let them go try to hire them again and alternatively maybe some comment on the potential benefit to test and to the simulation business john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer so let me answer one piece of that it s really we re not going to be letting anybody go in this context cai as we ve said before the max it s a nice piece of business for us but it s in that 30 million to 40 million a year range and so it s not an enormous part of our business and we have plenty to do for our folks that make that stuff so there is no question that we ll be reducing staff or anything like that we are still producing cai and i would say it s a very fluid situation at the moment which is why we decided not to guide to something in our numbers we ll do that at the end of the next quarter when we know for definite we have received notifications from our customer about potentially moving some stuff out but they ve not necessarily changed orders we also have the issue around that the we can still continue to produce we will probably even if they stop taking deliveries produced at a lower rates to build some safety stock and it s still very fluid as to what the reramp up is and so at this stage i think there s no question it will be a hit to both the sales and it is a profitable program so you can assume on the margin contribution it s perhaps similar to the average of the aircraft business so i ve no doubt that there will be some negative impact for us but exactly what that looks like will depend on exactly what boeing would like to do and then i ll respond to that in terms of how much we continue to produce versus how much we slow down but we have plenty of other things for folks to do so that s not a concern the simulation piece i just don t know cai so they ve announced that they i believe that boeing is now saying that they believe that some additional simulator training would be useful but myself and jennifer were at a defense conference a commercial and defense conference a couple of weeks ago and listening to the pilot unions at the time they didn t know anything about it and they couldn t size it i gather from what i ve heard that there are somewhere in the mid 30s high 30s max simulators on the planet at the moment and so you could imagine that there could be a need for additional simulators our own forecast for flight simulation this year was up just that marginally from last year and our folks believe that actually some of the big flight simulator folks built some white tails last year because we had some accelerated sales toward the back half of 2019 in anticipation of perhaps some additional training and so they may already be a little bit ahead of that curve and that so far we ve not heard anything but i could imagine that that could be a little bit of a pickup the type of stuff we make is not the type of thing you can suddenly double production in a quarter so it would be you d have to ramp it up over a few quarters our total simulation flight simulation business put in context is about a 70 million to 80 million piece of business in total so if there was a nice pick up there you could imagine that might compensate for some of the max but at this stage again we just haven t seen it and i think it s all very fresh cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst thank you and maybe on the big question your aircraft processed overhaul maybe update us in terms of what you ve done what people you still need to hire where you are in process changes and why you said you thought you might do a little bit better at the bottom line than you thought previously john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer well i was very careful at what i said cai i said potential upsides could be if it was faster than we are planning so i didn t say we would be better i d say it s cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst okay john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer i just want to be careful on that i don t want to get ahead of myself as i ve done in the past so when we re looking at the performance on our operational improvement let me break it down into four categories people processes capabilities and then results so on the people side we have continued to add additional talent into the operations and in the last quarter we have brought in two new leaders on two of our major sites again just strengthening the bench there in terms of our operational performance and coming out of the initial supply chain review with our consultants we re looking at how best to organize our supply chain to reflect both the geographical distribution of it and the way we work together to ensure the planning buying is combined and so that s in process so there s kind of organizational adjustments none of this is losing people it s just reorganizing how we work to make sure it s as streamlined as possible so additional skill up skilling additional talent and reviewing how we re organized to get the best out of it on the people side from a processes side i d say there is four major things that i talked about we ve talked about supplier improvement processes last time we talked we said the first initial three months to six months was really about analysis and then piloting and we are definitely moving into the rolling it out across the supplier community but keep in mind as i described in the past this is a because of the fact that you are locked in with suppliers the time to change suppliers the time to adjust things take so long from the time you re rolling out something until you actually see the results it just takes months and quarters so but we are rolling out those processes we feel very good about the processes and we ve slowed the amount of consulting activity on that because we feel like we re moving from the design it and try it to now we just have to roll it out ourselves that s on the supplier side we ve done a lot of work in refining and improving our sales and operations planning process which is very much around making sure we ve got all of the demands matching it to the operational side and that itself has shown up that we had some definite which in the past have contributed to misalignments between what we thought we were going to have to produce and what our capabilities were so we re finding that and planning processes internally we re working to improve and then the last one i would say is just in terms of metrics and reporting and visibility we ve put quite a lot of time and efforts on the it side to get better more real time reporting to understand exactly what s going on and of course that s one of the first steps in understanding how you get better and so we re seeing that we ve got much better dashboards much better real time information in terms of capabilities i d say both from the people and the equipment side jennifer mentioned we are spending more on capital and we ll continue to do that as we upgrade equipment from where we are some older equipment s or add equipments to free up bottlenecks and also on the people side as you go through better planning process you identified the bottleneck and turns out that in some of these because of demographics we ve lost capability to run the equipment as efficiently and effectively and over in the times that we want and so we re adding staff and capabilities but again these are difficult skills of getting a grinder some of these high end machining things it s difficult to find them and then it takes time to bring those people on board but we re systematically doing that and then finally in terms of results cai at the moment we re not seeing it and this is what we predicted in either cash or margins i would say our customers are feeling it though because part of when you run into some of these supply chain issues is an internal planning issues is you just start to struggle with making sure you re keeping up with all your customer demands and we definitely know that our customers are starting to feel better about that so that s we re seeing it there i think in time we ll see it the second thing we should see it on the cash flow as inventory starts to level out and then hopefully as a percentage of sales start to come down and then eventually it will work its way into the p l but as we said that s the back end of this fiscal year just given the length of time it takes to do these things so we re on plan we re working our way through it it s going to be a continuous month after month lot of hard work for people but we re feeling good about we re doing the right things and in time we ll start to see the results operator thank you our next question will be from robert spingarn with credit suisse john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer good morning rob robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst hi good morning hi john jennifer just on the max you ve been very clear actually you have a relative advantage i guess because you re not very exposed and based on what you said earlier it sounds like your profit exposure is maybe 1 million or 2 million if your margin is as you said is that about right john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer i do look be careful rob i didn t say that i said you might want to think of it as the average of our aircraft business but keep in mind its margin of contribution so just keep that in mind robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst fair enough and on about you said 30 million to 40 million in revenue exposure there john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer yeah that s our annual revenue so if it all went away i mean we ve already got one quarter down so its 10 million ish a quarter type of number so it depends on what the rest of the quarters look like robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst so with this being the case is there a chance that if this situation disrupts some other suppliers more exposed weakens them smaller folks could they be attractive m a targets for you john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer that s an interesting thought i think we are always looking for potential acquisitions that are adjacent to what we do sometimes adjacency is one step to the left or one step to the right sometime there could be vertical integration we do some components sensor type of software sales internally and obviously we ve got some significant suppliers that own it on 37 but more on the bigger ones that perhaps they would become available i m not sure that that s going to happen i think it would be an odd situation that i think everybody if you were selling your business would you sell it now and even if you did you just look through the max situation and say hey this is a hiccup and i want to value it on max a run rate of 50 plus a month so i d be surprised and right now one of the things that we know everybody sees is multiples seem to have we re on a whole new level i mean it seems like if you re not in the 13 14 15 range that just you re just not paying off and as i said in the past we find it very hard unless it s incredibly strategic to justify those types of levels so if the right thing came along absolutely we are constantly looking for acquisitions and we d be delighted that something adjacent similar technologies came along so we d be open to that i think we ve got a very strong balance sheet but i m not sure anybody s selling is going to say i m just selling out unless it s a fire sale which robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst well i think somebody who s distressed because they can t manage this the way you can because they re more exposed john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer that could be a that s a good question we ve not really thought about it it s a good question robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst okay all right now just switching over to the defense side of the business there was a point maybe it was a year ago you talked about some pricing pressure you d experienced some dod and some margin impact there is there any update to those trends anything that s happened since then and if there are any pressures how you re managing through that john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer i wouldn t say there s any updates this was a curious thing for me a year ago because as everybody knows the defense department is very focused on better buying power trying to get the best value for their dollar which is of course a completely sensible thing no i don t think there s any update on it i think we are continuing to operate the business as we do at that pressure we have seen and nobody else seems to see us our defense business is doing fine i said at the time defense is still a great business it s not to suggest defense is in a good business but i think across the portfolio whether it s industrial products commercial products or defense products there continues to be additional focus around how all our customers can get the best possible value for their dollar and that s not changed and i think that will continue as the defense spending continues to be strong i think that trend will continue but it s not something i guess i learned my lesson not to say is openly because that caused a lot of concerns at the time so robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst one thing that we have seen from dod is maybe some effort to change the acquisition approach so that they can own more of their ip and perhaps control more of their sustainment have you seen any effort from them or from your customers to change the ip dynamic where you d have less john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer i don t know that we ve explicitly seen anything from our customers but we are very clear rob we re an ip company and so we spend r d as part of some of these defense programs to make sure that the key ip is ours and we ve done it on our nickel and it s ours to keep and so we are very diligent in understanding the ip components of everything that we do and making sure that we are not we are not build to print designers you guys just designed this for us and then we will shop it around that s just not what we have core technologies and we keep them and in anything that we do in the defense world there s an enormous amount of background ip that we ve been developing for decades and so we spend r d and you may notice that in some of these things i would say we ve got a lot of funded developments but we re also spending more of our own r d dollars on the military side and that s the kind of in parallel with funded development work to make sure that the ip the key ip pieces are stuff that we re spending on ourselves and that we re keeping ownership of robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst okay thank you for that last one for jennifer on the working capital and cash flow you mentioned h1 is going to be under a little bit more pressure than h2 are there any negative free cash flow or very low free cash flow quarters we should anticipate really talking about q2 i suspect but do you dip negative at any point jennifer walter vice president and chief financial officer yeah i m hoping that we will be in a good shape for continuing on as we are right now certainly the first half so q2 will be under more pressure than the second half of the year there is we look at it all together inventory our receivables our customer advances as we progress through the year so we don t have a specific number out there for q2 as far as our free cash flow but again we ll have a slower start as we did in q1 for next quarter and as we get toward the back end of the year that s when we still should be able to see some of the benefits associated with our operational improvements robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst well maybe ask it john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer we have noticed here rob that cash tends to be very volatile i mean it depends on you can get significant receipts the last day of the quarter or they can push into the next quarter and so that s why we re always very cautious about giving a specific quarterly number because it can move around quite a lot in the space of a week or even a couple of days just based on people actually paying or not paying it robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst right and i was noticing you had a couple of negative quarters out over the last two three years but they re random and so i just wanted to be prepared for that if that was the case in q2 jennifer walter vice president and chief financial officer yeah when we typically like john said we do have these random quarters and so when we look at our cash we typically look at it over a few quarters in a row so that we eliminate that randomness for when we re actually looking at it from an operational perspective robert spingarn credit suisse securities analyst okay well thank you both john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer thanks rob jennifer walter vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you our next question will be from kristine liwag from baml kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey john john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer good morning kristine kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning your margins in q1 across all three segments were trending higher than your expected full year outlook for fiscal year 20 what are the headwinds that you re expecting that full year margins will be lower than where you are at this quarter john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer okay so let me walk through them so if i take aircraft we did a 11 4 in the first we re guiding to 10 5 for the year kristine i think i mentioned that we had a relatively positive mix we had some good foreign military stuff in the first quarter and we had relatively lower expenses and as we go through the rest of the year that mix will not be as positive because we just shipped a bunch of stuff in the first quarter because of the timing based on what our customer wanted so that we kind of unwind it is forecasted in the year we just happen to get in the first and then the expenses in the first were just lower than what we re anticipating for the year both on the some of the g a stuff and on the r d and we continue to add some staff to try and meet the goals that we have until we should see those expenses creep up as well so that s why first quarter was better in aircraft but we re guiding to slightly lower for the year but look at space and defense it just had a very strong first quarter i mean if you look at their number the 13 6 in the first quarter versus 11 8 last year i mean there was just some nice orders nice business nice mostly profitable mix for the year we re guiding to 13 we did 13 last year so i think again we see expenses picking up a little bit as we move through the year as we try to add engineering talent and some sales and operations folks to meet the ramp in terms of the production so i think that s in the it s been the ballpark and with industrial we re guiding we did 11 7 in the first and we re going to 11 1 now the 11 1 is down from i think what we said last quarter which was 11 4 and the reason for that is we ve added 35 million to the top line for the gat acquisition and we re not adding any operating profit because we ll have first year accounting adjustments and so that of itself takes out about 30 basis points of margin and so if you put that back in because in the first quarter it had negligible sales it only had a couple of million dollars so it wasn t really there you get you re in the 11 7 in the first 11 4 for the year you re kind of there or thereabouts so it s not there s not a big shift in that and the worry there as i mentioned is softening industrial automation in europe and that s typically a higher margin piece of business for us so i think there it s a nice start to the year but there s reasons why the first was a little bit better than we had anticipated some of it was timing of various things some of it was slower build up on expense and some of that i think will normalize as we go through the year so for the moment we feel like we don t want to get ahead of what we said before kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful john and when you think about your eps range for fiscal year 20 what are the one two or maybe three things that has to go your way to get to the upper end of your eps outlook john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer so at the end of my comments i tried to give a couple of possible upsides and downsides i think the upside is defense spending is going is very strong and it continues to be strong and so i could see that that may be stronger than we re anticipating and the operational activities in aircraft maybe we start to see some benefits from that till the back end of the year sooner than we had anticipated so i think those are the big two that i d say maybe simulator training maybe there s some additional orders that come in there we talked about that earlier for flight simulators so that could be positive upsides but i temper that with the fact that the industrial economies in europe are weakening and our folks there are feeling like we re still not seeing the bottom and so there s a worry that that could get worse than we re anticipating and the max we ve not built into our outlook at this stage any potential impact on the max because as i said there s too much movement around at the moment to be able to say this is what we think it looks like and rather than guide to some guide the market to something and then say in 90 days well no that wasn t that we changed it around we re essentially we left the max in at the rate that we were asked through the first quarter which is the 42 a month and so that is clearly optimistic and so there s some amount of downside associated with that we just haven t quantified it yet so you got pluses and minuses kristine kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s really helpful maybe last question for me and it s for jennifer jennifer how are you thinking about the incremental share buybacks and what would you have to see in the market to buyback more shares at this point jennifer walter vice president and chief financial officer so kristine thanks for the question we do look at all of these things and deploying capital on a kind of a full basis so we do consider what s going on in the m a pipeline when we re looking at deploying capital we do look at our share repurchases on an opportunistic basis obviously we ve got the dividend as part of our capital deployment strategy as well we consider where we are from a leverage standpoint so right now we re at the 2 3 times levered position so we will look at all of that together in a comprehensive way when we re making those decisions we don t we haven t historically shared what we are doing until after we would execute at the quarter so if we do any share repurchases we report back on that a quarter from now kristine liwag bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you very much jennifer walter vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator i m showing no further questions at this time john r scannell chairman and chief executive officer thank you carrie thank you all for listening in i hope in 90 days time i hope the max will actually be recertified i mean i think that s in all of our interests hopefully there ll be additional clarity around brexit and we won t have a trade dispute with europe and now we look forward to reporting out in 90 days time thank you all for your time thanks carrie operator

there are africans that call for the return of their colonial masters that can be held responsible since african politicians are worse so irresponsible these politicians are selling out everything from government corporations parastatals natural resources to raiding and laundering foreign reserves it is nothing short of divestment by african politicians indirectly giving major shares back to the same foreign corporations and businesses without responsibility that had handed over during the indigenization period isabel dos santos africa s richest woman whose father was the president of angola got access to lucrative deals involving land oil diamonds and telecoms another african country rich in natural resources looted worse than nigeria s former oil and petroleum minister diezani madueke did isabel dos santos and her husband were allowed to buy valuable angola state assets in a series of deals typical in most african countries the total amount of foreign investments and foreign aid coming into africa are dwarfed by the number of kickbacks obnoxious profits and money laundering leaking out of africa legally and illegally each time some of the money looted by politicians and their crony businessmen are eventually repatriated after taking out legal and administrative expenses the returned money is looted again by successive politicians nevertheless african politicians continue to pursue foreigners to deliver them importing experts financial gurus and foreign portfolio investors by incentivizing them with high interest rate returns that can never be sustained and profitable for local businesses or corporations to borrow one may wonder what types of expertise were needed that could not have been trained in any african country since independence in 60 years however training and producing these materials know how and experts at home would block the major loopholes for foreign contracts used by new administrations and their cronies to enrich one another if the local money kept in reserves were invested at home there would be no need to beg or depend on foreign investments from outside the bank most of their loots overseas pauperizing africa nigerian presidential candidate atiku like isabel actually boasted during the campaign that he would sell most of the parastatals as he did as vice president without any advantage to his country politicians ordered central bank to facilitate the transfer of parastatals for their private companies they borrowed the money from private banks to acquire parastatals and let the banks liquidate central bank then bailed them out actually the so called foreign portfolio investors main job is to watch developing countries foreign reserves grow so that foreign investors can get ready to make a kill this is why they send out newsletters about which country is ripe enough to be labeled the best place to do business emerging markets direct foreign investments the leader in 100 years and more flatteries the local stock market would shoot up based on hot air they would then take their profit out of the country until the cycle is repeated again why do africans echo or rely on the hot air projections of the fox waiting to raid the chicken coop they aid and abet the raiders for crumbs and access indeed once the foreign reserve has grown large enough superpowers or corporations can just sell an old fighter jet to one african country for use against its neighbor it is enough to deplete a good part of their foreign reserves most african french speaking countries cannot even touch their foreign reserve in france without the approval of old colonial master think about it foreigners are helping africans deplete local foreign reserves since they know looters do not invest at home without killer profits foreigners would not be rushing to africa to make money either but if foreign investors are given stipulations on long term goals like infrastructure they would label that country hostile without free market or call upon their government to sanction it the free and fair reciprocal market they do not have in their own countries they rig their own economy for the big boys politicians are after foreign odious loans that are known to be going into private pockets based on some warped logic that the united states the richest country in the world borrows from the chinese japanese and germans this logic is used by lagos to make tinubu richer than the state itself however the usa prints its own 100 00 bills that are worldly popular and abundant outside their country than inside creditworthy is not bankruptcy foreign investors look out for themselves africa must bail itself out like other countries the usa can pay back on demand by printing more 100 bills that would be snatched up by many countries including those burying hard currencies in sewage tanks mortuaries or transfer it to their shell companies in panama like other billionaires hiding their money but how acceptable are naira cedi rand shillings or zimbabwe dollar outside africa it must hastily be noted that heavy government involvement in the economy apart from regulations could be detrimental as in government business is nobody s business it is usually the functions of the private sector businesses and corporations to create jobs the role of governments is to step in where private businesses may be overwhelmed as hospitals schools and infrastructure but must create an enabling environment for all however if china had waited for the private sector to bail the country out of famine and poverty it suffered while africa was flowing with milk and honey china would not be a major competitor on the world stage with the united states china uses its influence as nuclear power and took advantage of western spite against the soviet union to gain access to the rich countries trade club indira gandhi former prime minister of indian had called for the same access fair and free trade not handouts china and india have reduced the world s poverty by pulling many of their poor people into the middle class while africa s poor keep on increasing china has done so by sensible government interventions and severe punishment for corruption on the other hand african countries with a relatively huge income had more money sucked out by foreign pensions and equity investors looking for maximum return in the shortest possible time foreign investors hardly embarked on a long term major project like infrastructure without demanding guarantees or sureties that the same projects would revert back to foreign control if they default always did on the odious loans most loans are bribes for an inflated contract between parties to employ their foreign workers as supervisors and above while africans remain laborers the odious loans are not only inflated but both parties also anticipate defaults because they are not reasonably packaged for payback therefore it is not surprising that the chinese are taking over land and infrastructure in zambia ghana sold its major gold industry to foreign investors and nigeria s ajaokuta steel industry has never been viable nigeria paris loan penalties and fines ballooned most of the major industries that were supposed to be major contributors to the countries foreign reserves have actually become a drain on africa s

the payments at forex com is that they are all free the broker does not charge fees for deposits or withdrawals there are not many banking methods available however traders can fund their accounts using credit or debit cards by mastercard visa or maestro the deposit appears instantly into their balance after the transaction has been confirmed deposits and withdrawals through this service are free of charge and transactions are extremely fast and secure the other way to make a deposit is through a bank transfer although practically anyone has access to this payment method it is not the most convenient way to fund an online trading account or to make any type of online payment deposits via bank transfers usually take around 3 working days to arrive so they are simply not an option for most traders withdrawals can be made using the same methods via either a credit debit card or a bank transfer once again the transaction takes longer if bank transfer is used rather than receiving your profits within 3 to 4 days via a card you would need to wait up to 10 working days for the money to reach your bank account another important thing to note is that the minimum deposit amount is only 50 which is impressive many brokers would not allow traders who have not deposited at least 2 000 in comparison forex com allows live trading accounts to be opened with only 100 deposit
