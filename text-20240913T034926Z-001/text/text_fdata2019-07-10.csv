the key focus the rest of this week will be on federal reserve chairman jerome powell who s set to testify before the us congress on thursday aest and friday traders are keen to hear his thoughts on the strength of the us economy and whether the fed is leaning toward a rate cut he s going to have to send a clear signal this week go no go or still unsure and watching the data said stephen stanley chief economist with amherst pierpont securities if he continues to be ambiguous the markets probably will assume that he approves of market pricing so he might as well take a position the stock market has hit new highs as concerns over the us trade battle with china have eased in recent weeks but at the same time growth slowed in the second quarter and is tracking about a 1 3 annual rate according to the atlanta fed s tracker he will affirm the economy remains solid if not spectacular said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton what matters most is what he sees as headwinds and how he characterises those risks they are driving the desire to do an insurance cut rbc capital market s tom porcelli it is not an exaggeration to say that nearly every day over the last couple of weeks we have written about our stance on the fed so it seems terribly redundant to again express our expectation for tomorrow but here you go just in case we do not believe there is justification to cut rates at this juncture and we would like nothing more than powell to express that view during wednesday s congressional testimony we have written at length about the solid labour backdrop elevated private savings how even at peak nervousness about china mexico trade relations the worst ism could muster was new orders that slowed to 50 etc for the most part we do not find that investors are pushing back significantly on our stance for a stand pat fed but if there is one area we do get pressed on it s about financial conditions advertisement as we wrote again yesterday a cut when conditions are so easy in combination with those aforementioned superlatives strains credibility and logic at present financial conditions per the bloomberg fci is about 1 standard deviation above normal i e in easy terrain but the thinking seems to go that conditions are only easy because the market anticipates a cut let s explore that a bit in the throes of the deterioration in us china trade relations as well as the threat of imposing tariffs on mexico financial conditions fell from 1 sd above normal to a half sd above normal mexico is no longer an issue and post the g20 meeting us china are on much better footing so if the thing that contributed to a softening in financial conditions has now been neutralised how far can conditions fall really against that backdrop our bigger point is this if powell is going to signal his inclination to cut rates then so be it but there is no concrete rationale to do so today s agenda local wbc mi consumer confidence july overseas data china cpi

by the end of this year we look for discussions regarding the risks to the economic expansion crosscurrents and a characterisation of the inflation outlook given the revisions to the downside for

federal reserve chairman jay powell statement to congress come as investors bet that the reserve s monetary policymakers will move as early as late july to cut its main interest rate by at least 25 basis points photograph getty chairman of the us federal reserve jay powell has cemented the case for the us central bank to cut interest rates based on mounting risks to the us economic outlook in dovish testimony to congress that fuelled expectations for a rate cut this month despite a strong jobs report for the month of june and last month s new truce in the trade war between the us and china mr powell said uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months particularly internationally economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies and that weakness could affect the us economy moreover a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved including trade developments the federal debt ceiling and brexit and there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate said mr powell the fed chief s statements to congress were delivered as investors are betting that the reserve s monetary policymakers will move as early as late july to cut its main interest rate by at least 25 basis points from its current level of 2 25 2 5 per cent read more mr powell did not commit to any time frame for possible monetary easing nor did he point to the scale of the interest rate cuts that would be required to protect the us economy from growing risks to the expansion but he repeatedly said the fed was committed to preventing a slowdown in the us economic expansion the s p 500 index jumped as much as 0 8 per cent to 3 002 98 crossing the 3 000 threshold for the first time before easing back to be 0 4 per cent higher by mid morning in new york the nasdaq composite and dow jones industrial average also touched new records us sovereign debt yields and the dollar pulled back immediately on the release of the testimony the fed s move towards looser monetary policy potentially reversing the tightening cycle that mr powell oversaw in 2018 comes as the central bank is under heavy pressure from us president donald trump who has been openly pushing the us central bank to cut rates drawing criticism that he is seeking to undermine the central bank s independence but the fed has insisted that it is fiercely protective of its autonomy mr powell said he had no intention of stepping down from the fed even if mr trump sought to fire him the law gives me a four year term and i fully expect to serve it he said the fed s consideration of interest rate cuts at a time of exceedingly low unemployment is being described by many economists as an insurance policy against a slowdown rather than a reaction to sharply worsening data so it may only result in one or two cuts rather than a more protracted easing cycle one of the risks for the fed in cutting rates now is that it could leave it less room to stimulate the economy once a new recession does come sometime in the future but mr powell said he did not expect a severe downturn in the us economy and insisted that the fed s tools would be adequate to tackle any future crisis facebook crypto currency mr powell also warned on wednesday that facebook s planned cryptocurrency called libra cannot move forward unless the social media group resolves serious concerns about the project libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy money laundering consumer protection and financial stability he said during testimony before the us house of representatives financial services committee these are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed before proceeding copyright the financial times limited 2019

host a president conference at 10 15 am where he is expected to continue with the dovish rhetoric that has become common place with major central banks the boc is not facing the same pressures as the fed to lower interest rates but trade headwinds have not shown signs of dissipating which will give poloz plenty to discuss during his press conference the us dollar is higher across the board on tuesday head of fed chair powell s testimony before congress and the release of the minutes from the june fomc where the central bank held rates unchanged but did signal an impending interest rate cut

source economic crisis a silhouette of the political crisis newsday zimbabwe july 9 2019 guest column learnmore zuze the enduring crisis in zimbabwe presents a conundrum to a lot of people to the generality of zimbabweans whose only desire is the pursuit of a dignified existence the debilitating liquidity crunch foreign currency shortages rising inflation spiralling basic commodity prices erosion of disposable incomes power outages and low productivity are a weight unbearable to carry retrospectively inclusive of the former president robert mugabe era it would be accurate to say that zimbabwe has shifted from one crisis to another for nearly two decades now twenty years of skills flight and economic instability are a long time of suffering it is for this reason that zimbabweans seem to have resigned to fate to the extent even of shunning stayaways that always result in loss of lives and property zimbabweans passionately loathe the situation within their country but clearly do not have the wherewithal to alter it they are simply going on with the tide of a catastrophe they cannot stop some zimbabweans born around 1999 are now moving into adulthood having grown under a cloud of economic uncertainty the zimbabwean political and economic tragedy has become the norm of zimbabwean life while it is easier to understand the zimbabwean crisis in terms of how it presents itself through the economy it is profoundly critical to realise that the zimbabwean tragedy is squarely traceable to the politics of the day this self evident truth was symptomatic of the mugabe zanu pf morgan tsvangirai mdc political feud which culminated in the government of national unity in 2009 in any set up no economic progress can occur in the presence of a political crisis where one entity has political power while the other wields economic influence today zimbabwe finds herself caught up in a situation where the economic crisis is nothing but a silhouette of the terrible political problems bedevilling the nation the current government has gone halfway around the world on an offensive to win international confidence the bretton woods institutions among many other potential helpful monetary institutions have been engaged so that they extinguish a colossal us 18 6 debt to no avail meanwhile a raft of measures including direct threats to businesses operating in the country and austerity measures have been applied in an attempt to contain the revolting economy with little success banning of the use of the united states dollar in local transactions has not stopped the public from using it the liberalisation of fuel imports has not tamed the ever growing fuel queues in the country it appears the more efforts are made to control the damage the more the damage continues this simply points to one thing zimbabwean problems are indicative of something deeply wrong with the politics without pulling punches the real key to unlocking the situation in zimbabwe is to start by fixing the politics of the country as long as nothing happens in the way of both political and economic reforms then the country still has a very long way to go it is a given that one of the worst ever things to happen to the present administration is its failure to win the confidence of zimbabweans in particular and that of the world in general for example it is an open secret that zimbabweans have plenty of foreign currency stashed in different places as they mistrust taking it to banks history has contributed to this general apprehension people remain sceptical of taking their hard earned currency to banks in exchange of the bond notes it is simply a question of lack of confidence in the government by zimbabweans the forex reserves held up by people probably run into millions of us dollars but an apparent lack of confidence in the system is feeding the crisis with regards the extent to which the confidence of the international community has been harmed there really is no secret the united states was honest enough to tell the zimbabwean government last month that it needed to fulfil some tough conditions including political and electoral reforms accountability for past atrocities and compensation for the white farmers who lost their land under mugabe s land reform programme among others the us even went further clearly highlighting that it was urgent that the killer soldiers who fired at protesters in the post election august 1 2018 demonstrations be made to account we may debate theories postulate and pontificate about the economic malaise in zimbabwe but the untainted truth is that massive changes have to occur within the broader politics of this country it must be clearly mastered that a simplistic view in mending the economy is self defeating fixing the zimbabwean crisis is not as easy as picking an alternative currency like the south african rand or botswana pula in the absence of production where almost everything has to be imported coupled with an archaic industrial infrastructure then no economy can be revamped it sounds rather trite yet it is the truth about the zimbabwean crisis only when the essential political problems are adequately addressed can the international confidence return zimbabwe is a country of massive potential but remains trapped in an economic paralysis whose major panacea is simply the return of confidence in the zanu pf government learnmore zuze is a legal officer and writes in his personal capacity

host a president conference at 10 15 am where he is expected to continue with the dovish rhetoric that has become common place with major central banks the boc is not facing the same pressures as the

alexis tsipras ceded the office of prime minister monday to the new democracy leader kyriakos mitsotakis the new york times written by matina stevis gridneff and steven erlanger with a quiet handshake at the door of maximos mansion on a tree lined street in central athens alexis tsipras ceded the office of prime minister monday to the new democracy leader kyriakos mitsotakis it was the kind of uneventful handover of power that heralded greece s return to normality after being ground zero of one of the most tumultuous periods in global economic history advertisement the election victory sunday by a traditional center right party was the end of greece s flirtation with radical left wing populist politics even as the radicals of tsipras syriza party transformed themselves into a mainstream force of the center left the tsipras experiment may hold important lessons for europe and its new ranks of anti establishment populists while many as in italy gleefully thumb their noses at the european union and its rules once in power the risks of following through on their rebelliousness may corral them from the extremes greece represented a special wrenching case but its experience showed that especially for small countries if you are in the eurozone you re not free to run a radical financial policy said charles grant the director of the center for european reform the combination of eu rules and the financial markets forced a kind of orthodoxy on greece and will probably work similarly with italy the other major lesson grant said is that the idea of a small country leaving the euro whatever the good and bad of the euro is bonkers and that the euro itself is not going to fall to pieces advertisement mujtaba rahman managing director for europe of eurasia group underlined the point the syriza experiment is consistent with the experience of other eu member states that also tried to defy the eu and capital markets and failed such as portugal and more recently italy he said when the eu and capital markets align in seeking changes that will make a country s finances more sustainable or improving the environment in which the private sector operates governments no matter how radical have no real choice but to reform rahman said greece s experience is a cautionary tale but portugal s spain s and italy s have all been too while all populists are hardly the same and many of europe s newer ones as in hungary have come to power on anti immigrant policies greece could be an indication that populists in power can end up behaving responsibly said mark leonard the director of the european council on foreign relations populists are not always as scary in office as they may appear he said noting the continuing populist experiment in much larger italy where euroskeptics are in power but remain reluctant to challenge the european union and the budget rules of the euro advertisement tsipras won praise in brussels and washington for his transformation into an establishment politician a shape shift that some regard as betrayal his critics say that transformation came only after he did severe damage to the greek economy if greece has returned to normality the new normal in some ways is a lot like the old with greece reverting to being a peripheral european country that no longer has the potential to destabilize global markets or bring down the euro the last four years have been a waste and totally unnecessary said maria demertzis deputy director of bruegel an economic research institute in brussels who is herself greek tsipras learned fast but not before he had inflicted such a cost on the economy facing a choice between default on its debt in a crisis that began in 2010 and another bailout from creditors that would bring more austerity tsipras called for a referendum in 2015 and asked greeks to reject it advertisement they did only to have tsipras accept even harsher terms to avoid expulsion from the eurozone ushering in even tougher austerity policies and costing the economy billions of euros after he put the financial system on lockdown destroying confidence in banks tsipras ultimately did little despite promises to brussels and the international monetary fund to confront and restructure greece s large civil service and its clientelist economy in many ways demertzis said it was the waste of a crisis that could have been used to modernize the greek state for that reason even though greeks may be poor and exhausted by the long debt crisis there will be no honeymoon for the next prime minister she said while the economy is again showing modest growth expected to be about 2 this year greece s national output shrank by one quarter during the crisis poverty is rife unemployment at around 18 is the highest in the eurozone and many of greece s smartest and best educated are working abroad advertisement mitsotakis who is business friendly intends to try to unblock some of the privatization projects tsipras agreed to but never carried out and he has promised to reduce the primary surplus the budget surplus without counting debt service to 2 5 from the current 3 5 of gdp demanded by greece s creditors in an effort to free up more space for the tax cuts he has promised the middle class he is right that the middle class in greece needs saving demertzis said but it has to be done in agreement with brussels which has so far said that no changes can be made to the bailout deal mitsotakis has said he won t do it right away to gain credibility with the creditors first she said but it s not his decision alone mitsotakis biggest challenge is likely to be trying to change an overregulated and dysfunctional state as he tries to deliver quickly on promises of investments and reforms that will create higher paying jobs panos tsakloglou who teaches economics at athens university and served as chairman of the greek council of economic advisers from 2012 to 2014 says tsipras government could not have pushed through public sector reforms it did not believe in advertisement to do market liberalization you need to believe in market liberalization he said mitsotakis will be better placed to go ahead with some of these reforms he understands what kind of reforms are needed and knows how to do them he said and while mitsotakis may be able to cut taxes as promised if the international creditors decide to give him a little space to build goodwill that is unlikely to be enough to speed up greece s growth or create decently paying jobs demertzis noted that mitsotakis had already moved to reduce the size of government with a smaller cabinet and has said that he will establish his office not in maximos mansion but in the ministry for reform advertisement at the same time said leonard of the european council on foreign relations the european union itself has learned from the greek crisis that you need to have a more balanced economic deal greece he said was an important petri dish for strict german economics which haven t succeeded the actions of the european central bank have been crucial in restoring some stability by allowing a bit more oxygen into the system he said while noting that the most successful countries that had market enforced austerity like spain and portugal were not led by populist governments and now look mainstream it is difficult to generalize too much from the greek example leonard said but it is also striking that a once derided center right party new democracy could return to power with a majority greece appeared to be back to what is a traditional two party system with the transformed syriza taking over the role of the center left opposition from the nearly defunct pasok which has suffered many of the same problems as other traditional socialist parties in europe like germany s social democrats advertisement we re back to the two party system we had before the crisis demertzis said is that good or bad it s hard to say but it s what greece knows and it provides stability
stocks finished higher wednesday as wall street welcomed new signals suggesting the federal reserve is ready to cut interest rates for the first time in a decade technology stocks drove much of the gains nudging the nasdaq composite to an all time high the benchmark standard poor s 500 index briefly traded above 3 000 for the first time before pulling back to just below its record high close the market climbed early on after fed chairman jerome h powell said that many fed officials believe a weakening global economy and rising trade tensions have strengthened the case for a rate cut advertisement powell s remarks delivered as part of his semiannual monetary report to congress allayed investors concerns that an unexpectedly strong u s jobs report that came out friday might give the fed reason to stay put on interest rates investors are increasingly confident that the fed will cut rates by a quarter point at the end of the month which most investors expected said kate warne chief investment strategist at edward jones this removed a little bit of the uncertainty there and that s why we re seeing stocks move higher the s p 500 index rose 13 44 points or 0 5 to 2 993 07 the index which set three record highs last week is now less than 0 1 below its july 3 record high the dow jones industrial average rose 76 71 points or 0 3 to 26 860 20 the nasdaq climbed 60 80 points or 0 7 to 8 202 53 breaking the record it set july 3 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks rose 2 46 points or 0 2 to 1 565 05 the dollar fell and the price of gold rose the u s stock market rallied through much of june after the fed first signaled that it might cut rates if necessary to shore up the u s economy powell s testimony before the house financial services committee on wednesday came at a time when the u s economic landscape is mixed although the job market appears resilient and consumer spending and home sales look solid the economy is probably slowing and the u s trade disputes have added uncertainty to the economic outlook advertisement in his prepared statements powell said that since fed officials met last month uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook meanwhile inflation has fallen further from the fed s target it makes it so odd to think that we actually need to have this kind of stimulus from the fed to continue this expansion said terry dufrene global investment specialist at j p morgan private bank but the fact is you re starting to see some of those signals out there the economy could start slowing and the fed just wants to get ahead of that the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 after the central bank raised it four times last year many investors have put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 a quarter point cut in interest rates which many investors expect isn t likely to have a big effect on consumers credit cards or mortgage rates but it would reassure markets that the fed would be open to further rate cuts if more signs of weakness in the global economy emerge warne said shifting from raising rates to lowering rates is a regime change she said the second thing is we ve already seen long term interest rates come down partly in expectation of the rate cut powell is scheduled to appear before the senate banking committee on thursday investors will have to wait until the end of the month to see what action the fed takes on interest rates at its next meeting of policymakers before then the market will turn its attention to the upcoming company earnings reporting season which begins next week advertisement companies have been lowering expectations for how much profit they made in the april through june quarter wall street now projects that overall s p 500 company earnings for the quarter fell 2 6 from a year earlier according to factset as recently as the end of march earnings were forecast to be down only 0 5 this could be the first time in three years that s p 500 companies report back to back declines in overall earnings technology companies accounted for much of the market s gains

stocks rose as the price of u s crude oil climbed 4 5 chevron shares rose 1 7 bond prices rose sharply that pushed the yield in the 10 year treasury note to 2 06 down from 2 10 shortly before powell s

mac margolis argentina s foreign minister fought back tears president maurico macri called it the most important agreement ever signed in our history latin america s biggest economy would soon be reborn predicted a top aide to brazilian president jair bolsonaro who likewise heralded the great day the june 28 deal between the european union and mercosur was a breakthrough who knew that even as china and the us played chicken with international trade 31 nations with a 10th of world population and a fourth of its wealth would agree to abide by global rules and swap goods freely across the atlantic in reality of course the mercosur eu pact is a decadeslong work in progress in which interests and ideologies will continue to clash on both sides of the equator contrarian parliaments bell jar industries organized labor and environmental backsliding could still delay dilute or neuter the agreement a hint of those difficulties emerged last week when norway and germany warned they might scrap funding for the amazon fund for conservation if brazilian authorities fell back on commitments to halt deforestation in the world s largest rainforest a major caveat in the trade agreement yet even before the first containers roll duty free into the new trade zone latin america comes out the big winner historically free trade has found little traction in the southern flank of the americas its rare champions were seen as turncoats in service to flagless neoliberals and carpetbaggers in the early 2000s the pink tide of left wing latin american governments swamped the admittedly washington led free trade area of the americas this aversion to open borders contaminated even the region s own wannabe common market launched in the early 90s by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay as a south american trade zone mercosur soon devolved into a fair weather arrangement diminished by beggar thy neighbor nationalism safeguards antidumping and countervailing duties the total value of goods traded within mercosur has remained flat for the last 15 years and actually fallen since 2011 according to the inter american development bank you have to look hard to find another trade agreement with as little intra zone growth as mercosur said guillermo tolosa executive director of the uruguayan think tank center for economic and social policy research critics are right to call it less a common market than an exercise in ceremonial regionalism its solipsism did not just stunt commerce it enfeebled industries that ought to have been steeled for global competition by eliminating import tariffs on the vast majority of two way trade 92 percent of mercosur s exports in 10 years and 92 percent of the eurozone s goods within 15 years the new pact puts slackers on notice but also presents latin america with big opportunities there s great potential for brazil and argentina to upgrade productivity by importing technology said monica de bolle senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics this is an avenue for enhancing competiveness brazilian and argentine agribusiness have long shown that given a level playing field they can feed the world they stand to win big once the eu trade deal sweeps away most of the lingering barriers in one of the world s most protected consumer markets under the agreement the eu will eliminate tariffs on 82 percent of mercosur orange juice fruit and coffee and raise quotas of tariff free beef sugar and ethanol over a decade the learning curve for other less competitive mercosur industries such as auto parts machines chemicals and pharmaceuticals will be steeper low skilled workers huge underperforming informal economies and chronic underinvestment in infrastructure keep the bar low for enterprise and competitiveness among mercosur partners brazilian economist armando castelar of the getulio vargas foundation recently concluded that most off books companies probably survive only because they don t pay taxes the most inflexible labor regulations in latin america discourage job creation workplace training and productivity in argentina though recognized for its quality of life indicators uruguay has an economy that is cosseted by perks and subsidies in times of electronic fare cards almost half the bus fleet in montevideo still operates with manual ticket sellers to bankroll such obsolescence uruguay imposes a surtax on diesel fuel and transfers the takings to the bus companies the nation s outdated sugarcane industry is no better we could import ethanol from brazil at half the domestic price said tolosa instead we protect inefficient big producers and charge a higher price at the pump for gasohol this reflects how little mercosur has achieved under the new trade agreement such practices cannot stand much as brazil s accession to the organization for economic cooperation and development requires rising to the competitiveness standards of the most advanced economies joining the eu trade pact means its partners must shed historic indulgences the difference is that failing to comply with trade agreement rules carries potentially stiff penalties and risks sure reprisals mercosur s golden straightjacket may also bring other more short term advantages for its troubled sponsors even as economic fortunes slide and political incendiaries court crisis weary voters by

dollar drops notably in response to fed chair jerome powell s prepared remains for the two day congressional testimony which starts today the greenback is currently the weakest one for today followed by yen and the canadian on the other hand new zealand dollar is the strongest one followed by swiss franc and then sterling quick updates boc left interest rate unchanged at 1 75 as widely expected more here dollar stays weak after powell didn t deliberately dismiss july cut yet he wasn t dovish enough to push dollar lower indeed stocks has reversed much of earlier gains at the time of writing more here traders seems to be assuming that powell s reference that uncertainties continue to weigh on outlook as a nod to july rate cut yet powell will still need to be more explicit in the q a session of the testimony currently markets are still pricing in 100 chance of a fed rate cut this month we d like to point out again that just back in june nine out of seventeen fomc participants expected interest rates to stay at 2 25 2 50 or higher within this year it s rather hard to imagine these nine policymakers would change their mind for a cut after mexican tariffs were averted us and china agreed to halt trade war escalation and a solid june nfp report boc is another major focus in us session it s widely expected to keep policy rate unchanged at 1 75 the case for easing faded

notably in response to fed chair jerome powell s prepared speech for the semi annual congressional testimony most importantly powell said since june meeting based on incoming data and other developments it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook inflation pressures remain muted powell also reiterated fed s stance that in light of increased uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures we would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion however just based on the prepared remarks there is no confirmation on a july rate cut thus selloff in dollar is relatively limited so far powell will need to be really straightforward in the q a of the testimony eu kept 2019 growth forecasts unchanged downgraded 2020 slightly comparing to spring projections

quarters of contraction janine boshoff economist in the macroeconomic modelling and forecasting team said our latest estimate implies that the economy will narrowly avoid a technical recession in the middle quarters of this year that said the latest ons data and recent surveys suggest that the economy has lost considerable momentum since the first quarter this reflects the impact of brexit related

if any one image helped illustrate the unique nature of the humanitarian crisis in venezuela it was a photograph taken in february showing two shipping containers and a fuel tanker blocking a bridge to colombia the purpose of the barricade was to keep out a convoy of us donated aid making its way to venezuela from bogota the attempted aid initiative took place in a particularly tense political context weeks earlier the us had officially recognized opposition leader juan guaidó as venezuela s interim president but the government of nicolás maduro which brought about the country s economic collapse through mismanagement and corruption clung to power for the maduro regime squashing what it saw as a politically motivated relief effort was a way to keep us and opposition influence at bay it was also a move that tracked with maduro s long history of turning down humanitarian help he often notes his is not a nation of beggars and blames economic woes on us sanctions even as there were signs of increasingly alarming conditions inside venezuela as vox s alex ward reported earlier this year inflation in the country now hovers above a million percent and could reach 10 million percent this year according to the international monetary fund food and medicine are too expensive for many to purchase and since 2015 more than 3 million venezuelans have left the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere primarily in colombia it s expected that another 2 million will become refugees in 2019 alone the once rich oil country is facing malnutrition four out of five households live in food insecurity and more than one in 10 venezuelans are undernourished and it s grappling with the comeback of nearly eradicated tropical diseases as well as a reduced life expectancy the immensity of the need in venezuela meant that the government in an about face has started allowing some streams of aid in recent months including shipments of medical supplies and power generators from the red cross but maduro s refusal to formally declare a humanitarian emergency makes it impossible for many other international agencies including unicef and the world food programme to get involved and the humanitarian supplies that do make it to venezuela can t be easily distributed where they need to get to since basic transportation infrastructure in the country has crumbled and soldiers often steal provisions at military checkpoints meanwhile the small local aid groups that do their best to feed the hungry in the absence of significant foreign assistance are accused by officials of anti government activism in that intractable landscape venezuelans in need have increasingly turned to a new tool to receive aid one that facilitates the delivery of both charitable donations and remittances cryptocurrency as venezuela continues sinking into the worst economic crisis in its history it is also emerging as a unique case study for the potential of digital money to make aid possible and decrease suffering in distressed countries cryptocurrency powered aid is making a difference in venezuela imagine you re a venezuelan living in the us you have family members back home in caracas the capital who you know are hanging in there but desperately need some help but there are very few avenues at your disposal you could try shipping packages filled with necessities like shampoo or clothes or canned food but there s no guarantee that those would make it to their intended recipients you could wire your relatives or local nonprofits some money but bank transfers can take a long time and the venezuelan government would slap heavy fines so you grab your smartphone and turn to a last resort bitcoin that allows you to tap into a new and growing ecosystem of aid delivery in venezuela one that s built entirely around direct intermediary free cryptocurrency transactions take local charities like the bitcoin for venezuela initiative or eatbch they receive cryptocurrency donations from around the world incurring almost no cost or fees from intermediaries along the way to purchase food for the needy in venezuela reaching people at soup kitchens and distribution centers across the country those two operations serve thousands of meals a day it s a model that is now being replicated in places like nicaragua or south sudan there s also been experimentation with direct cryptocurrency transfers earlier this year givecrypto a san francisco charity provided temporary assistance to hundreds of vulnerable families in venezuela through weekly crypto deposits worth around 7 every week from february to april families received the deposits through a smartphone app which they were then able to trade for local currency through online transfers as cnbc reported that weekly infusion of digital money equal to the monthly minimum wage in venezuela helped participating families stop having to skip meals another initiative spearheaded by online currency exchange platform airtm will airdrop a one time crypto payment of 10 to 100 000 individuals in venezuela this coming august so far the company has raised about 300 000 from donations toward its 1 million goal cryptocurrency has also paved the way for fast cost effective remittances money transfers from friends and family abroad that elude government restrictions as moises rendon an associate director at the center for strategic international studies told me remittance flows have become the second largest source of income in venezuela after oil production with about 300 million dollars coming in to the country every month from abroad that s made the government eager to take a cut as alex gladstein writes in time new laws force venezuelans to go through local banks for foreign transactions and require banks to disclose information on how individuals get and use their money according to alejandro machado a cryptocurrency researcher at the open money initiative a wire transfer from the united states can now encounter a fee as high as 56 as it passes from dollars to bolivares in a process that can last several weeks most recently venezuelan banks have under pressure from the government even prevented clients using foreign ip addresses from accessing their online accounts cryptocurrency based remittances though can circumvent those controls sending bitcoin to family members back home in venezuela for instance takes moments and only incurs a small fee since that asset is sent directly to the recipient s phone as opposed to being routed through a bank or another financial institution it is safe from government interference and can be easily liquidated through local exchanges looking forward innovation in the crypto space in venezuela will likely only accelerate as hyperinflation remains on track to surpass 10 million percent by the end of the year according to the imf after all the dramatic collapse of the bolivar means that the logistics of making conventional payments are becoming more and more difficult cash is scarce and traditional payment networks are overloaded and it means that saving money is nearly impossible because its value drops so quickly if left unused their own volatility notwithstanding cryptocurrencies could help on both those fronts especially as a growing number of merchants in the country start accepting a number of different digital currencies as payment as a result of all this venezuela already finds itself ranked as the fourth country in the world in bitcoin trade with the average daily volume of the cryptocurrency traded on localbitcoins just one of several online marketplaces where people can exchange bitcoin for local currency reaching 5 2 billion bolivares as joe waltman the executive director of givecrypto told cnbc crypto has the highest likelihood of being helpful to people in places where money is broken and there s probably no better example of broken money right now than venezuela cryptocurrency and the future of humanitarian aid when it comes to the potential of blockchain and digital currencies to help revolutionize humanitarian aid systems excitement abounds with international relief organizations losing up to 3 5 percent of every aid transaction to different costs and fees and with 30 percent of all development funds being lost to corruption according to former un secretary general ban ki moon advocates say that intermediary free cryptocurrency transactions are a less expensive way of doing business in addition as direct cash interventions continue to gain traction in development circles the kind of direct peer to peer giving that blockchain technology makes so easy and which is evident in venezuela can also come off as especially effective with nonprofits leveraging digital currency platforms to help vulnerable people in other countries as well a growing number of donors are sitting up and taking notice but just as venezuela is shining a spotlight on the humanitarian potential of cryptocurrency it is also underlining how far away that technology still is from being able to truly revolutionize current aid systems for one cryptocurrency transactions depend on a functioning electricity grid and stable internet service both of which have been far from guaranteed in blackout ravaged venezuela more operational challenges in that country which are also present in many others in the developing world include limited smartphone penetration and less than widespread computer and financial literacy that means the humanitarian benefits of crypto are difficult to scale up basic services are not working many cities don t have electricity for 10 to 12 hours every day rendon says so yes crypto has potential to help but the situation is so extreme that it s hard to see the crypto benefits scaling to the level that is needed another stumbling block is that when it comes to crypto giving concerns around accountability and transparency have yet to be resolved in part because the parties involved in a transaction can largely remain anonymous anyone who tells you that they can track inside venezuela with 100 percent accuracy and prove that a donation has been spent in two bags of food that s not true said randy brito the founder of the bitcoin for venezuela initiative which uses cryptocurrency donations to buy and distribute food inside the country eatbch runs a very similar operation to the bitcoin for venezuela initiative their accountability system is to upload photos on twitter that show folks eating donated food and a handwritten sign with the code of the transaction that helped pay for it as rendon notes that s good enough for a few thousand dollars but not for like half a million dollars another obstacle that might stand in the way of cryptocurrencies adoption among the donor community is their somewhat dubious reputation and connection to illicit activities like money laundering that narrative is one that recent developments in venezuela helped perpetuate last year the government tried and failed to launch a state sanctioned digital currency the petro in large part to circumvent international sanctions so cryptocurrency will not be the silver bullet that resolves the humanitarian crisis in venezuela the dimension of the hardship faced by the population is too big and the streams of aid crypto makes possible are too new and too difficult to expand that said crypto s ability to help put food on the table for some people and the bigger picture role it plays helping reestablish free market mechanisms in a damagingly repressive economic context shows the technology s philanthropic potential as rendon summed up it s taking control away from the regime and empowering the people if venezuela teaches us anything it s that for those living under authoritarianism or suffering from hyperinflation bitcoin ethereum and other cryptocurrencies can be useful financial tools that s

financial markets are eagerly awaiting the beginning of the fed s easing cycle while the us economy enters the 11th year in the current expansion global economic slowdown worries a neverending trade war and deflationary pressures have the fed poised to deliver an insurance cut this month and possibly more in the following meetings to ensure a soft landing the most anticipated event of the week is fed chair powell s two days of testimony on capitol hill despite a robust labor market the us economy is slowing down as global growth concerns remain elevated as trade tensions show no immediate signs of easing equities could fall under pressure if powell commits to only one rate cut and if he is content on waiting to see if inflation continues to stabilize and if the risks to the economy improve the minutes will also be released in the afternoon and should be rather dovish but will likely take a backseat to powell powell to reiterate fed will act as appropriate signalling the july meeting is live souring global trade and risks to the outlook could raise 2019 fed rate cut expectations from 2 to 3 stocks receiving some support from renewed trade talk momentum the fate of the us stock market will continue to rely on a strong dovish commitment by the fed continued progress with the us china trade war and for the upcoming earnings season to keep on targeting a strong fourth quarter rebound the dollar is potentially poised to finally breakout of its tight range against the euro on expectations the fed will be delivering more rate cuts than the other major central banks going forward trade war trade updates have been quiet since the g20 sideline meetings between president trump and xi markets were relieved that the two leaders resumed negotiations with the us holding off on delivering new tariffs and reducing pressure on huawei while china resumed purchases of agricultural goods and the continuation of existing us tariffs today us and chinese officials continued negotiations over the phone in what is expected to shortly yield an in person meeting both sides are politically motivated to wrap this up china initially thought they would be better waiting out trump but now that it seems he is likely to get re elected china will try to persuade him to agree on more purchases of us goods in exchange for the limited changes on structural reform cad bank of canada is the last central bank that needs to go full dove canada s economy is starting to show signs of weakness but they should be able to wait a couple more months before having to signal the economy is in need for stimulus inflation and gdp remain strong while the consumer and trade have softened currently markets are pricing in a 24 chance of a rate cut at the october 30th meeting earnings season another earnings season is upon us and this should be a very disappointing one with negative growth around 2 3 and possible further cuts to guidance so far we have seen a severe cut to guidance from the world s largest chemical maker basf levi straus reported disappointing earnings that missed the lowest estimate while pepsico continued its string of strong results next week the

brexit oil west texas intermediate crude surged after the weekly api oil inventories posted a third consecutive strong draw crude stockpiles fell 4 97 million barrels last week possibly suggesting

alexis tsipras ceded the office of prime minister monday to the new democracy leader kyriakos mitsotakis the new york times written by matina stevis gridneff and steven erlanger with a quiet handshake at the door of maximos mansion on a tree lined street in central athens alexis tsipras ceded the office of prime minister monday to the new democracy leader kyriakos mitsotakis it was the kind of uneventful handover of power that heralded greece s return to normality after being ground zero of one of the most tumultuous periods in global economic history advertisement the election victory sunday by a traditional center right party was the end of greece s flirtation with radical left wing populist politics even as the radicals of tsipras syriza party transformed themselves into a mainstream force of the center left the tsipras experiment may hold important lessons for europe and its new ranks of anti establishment populists while many as in italy gleefully thumb their noses at the european union and its rules once in power the risks of following through on their rebelliousness may corral them from the extremes greece represented a special wrenching case but its experience showed that especially for small countries if you are in the eurozone you re not free to run a radical financial policy said charles grant the director of the center for european reform the combination of eu rules and the financial markets forced a kind of orthodoxy on greece and will probably work similarly with italy the other major lesson grant said is that the idea of a small country leaving the euro whatever the good and bad of the euro is bonkers and that the euro itself is not going to fall to pieces advertisement mujtaba rahman managing director for europe of eurasia group underlined the point the syriza experiment is consistent with the experience of other eu member states that also tried to defy the eu and capital markets and failed such as portugal and more recently italy he said when the eu and capital markets align in seeking changes that will make a country s finances more sustainable or improving the environment in which the private sector operates governments no matter how radical have no real choice but to reform rahman said greece s experience is a cautionary tale but portugal s spain s and italy s have all been too while all populists are hardly the same and many of europe s newer ones as in hungary have come to power on anti immigrant policies greece could be an indication that populists in power can end up behaving responsibly said mark leonard the director of the european council on foreign relations populists are not always as scary in office as they may appear he said noting the continuing populist experiment in much larger italy where euroskeptics are in power but remain reluctant to challenge the european union and the budget rules of the euro advertisement tsipras won praise in brussels and washington for his transformation into an establishment politician a shape shift that some regard as betrayal his critics say that transformation came only after he did severe damage to the greek economy if greece has returned to normality the new normal in some ways is a lot like the old with greece reverting to being a peripheral european country that no longer has the potential to destabilize global markets or bring down the euro the last four years have been a waste and totally unnecessary said maria demertzis deputy director of bruegel an economic research institute in brussels who is herself greek tsipras learned fast but not before he had inflicted such a cost on the economy facing a choice between default on its debt in a crisis that began in 2010 and another bailout from creditors that would bring more austerity tsipras called for a referendum in 2015 and asked greeks to reject it advertisement they did only to have tsipras accept even harsher terms to avoid expulsion from the eurozone ushering in even tougher austerity policies and costing the economy billions of euros after he put the financial system on lockdown destroying confidence in banks tsipras ultimately did little despite promises to brussels and the international monetary fund to confront and restructure greece s large civil service and its clientelist economy in many ways demertzis said it was the waste of a crisis that could have been used to modernize the greek state for that reason even though greeks may be poor and exhausted by the long debt crisis there will be no honeymoon for the next prime minister she said while the economy is again showing modest growth expected to be about 2 this year greece s national output shrank by one quarter during the crisis poverty is rife unemployment at around 18 is the highest in the eurozone and many of greece s smartest and best educated are working abroad advertisement mitsotakis who is business friendly intends to try to unblock some of the privatization projects tsipras agreed to but never carried out and he has promised to reduce the primary surplus the budget surplus without counting debt service to 2 5 from the current 3 5 of gdp demanded by greece s creditors in an effort to free up more space for the tax cuts he has promised the middle class he is right that the middle class in greece needs saving demertzis said but it has to be done in agreement with brussels which has so far said that no changes can be made to the bailout deal mitsotakis has said he won t do it right away to gain credibility with the creditors first she said but it s not his decision alone mitsotakis biggest challenge is likely to be trying to change an overregulated and dysfunctional state as he tries to deliver quickly on promises of investments and reforms that will create higher paying jobs panos tsakloglou who teaches economics at athens university and served as chairman of the greek council of economic advisers from 2012 to 2014 says tsipras government could not have pushed through public sector reforms it did not believe in advertisement to do market liberalization you need to believe in market liberalization he said mitsotakis will be better placed to go ahead with some of these reforms he understands what kind of reforms are needed and knows how to do them he said and while mitsotakis may be able to cut taxes as promised if the international creditors decide to give him a little space to build goodwill that is unlikely to be enough to speed up greece s growth or create decently paying jobs demertzis noted that mitsotakis had already moved to reduce the size of government with a smaller cabinet and has said that he will establish his office not in maximos mansion but in the ministry for reform advertisement at the same time said leonard of the european council on foreign relations the european union itself has learned from the greek crisis that you need to have a more balanced economic deal greece he said was an important petri dish for strict german economics which haven t succeeded the actions of the european central bank have been crucial in restoring some stability by allowing a bit more oxygen into the system he said while noting that the most successful countries that had market enforced austerity like spain and portugal were not led by populist governments and now look mainstream it is difficult to generalize too much from the greek example leonard said but it is also striking that a once derided center right party new democracy could return to power with a majority greece appeared to be back to what is a traditional two party system with the transformed syriza taking over the role of the center left opposition from the nearly defunct pasok which has suffered many of the same problems as

beijing china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 percent this year a reuters poll showed on july 10 despite a flurry of support measures to spur domestic demand amid a bruising trade war with the united states the median forecast was unchanged from the last poll in april but a stream of downbeat data in recent months and higher u s tariffs have fanned expectations that beijing will need to roll out more stimulus soon to ward off a sharper slowdown that could stoke job losses second quarter growth was seen cooling to 6 2 percent from a year earlier the same as in the previous poll from 6 4 percent in the first quarter china will post its second quarter gross domestic product gdp on july 15 most of the 72 institutions covered in the survey expect growth will remain at 6 2 percent for the rest of this year compared with expectations for a tick up to 6 3 percent in the previous poll zhang yiping senior economist at merchants securities in shenzhen said he expected the u s tariff hike in may on 200 billion of chinese goods to weigh on growth in the second half but zhang said authorities are likely to stick to more moderate policy easing rather than resorting to more aggressive measures we expect policy this year would focus more on building a floor to underpin the economy rather than to boost growth he said so far china s stimulus measures have been more restrained than in past downturns which analysts attribute to fears of adding to a mountain of debt left over from past credit binges investors rest on a chair in front of screens showing stock market movements at a securities company in beijing on may 14 2019 wang zhao afp getty images the full year forecast would be nearing the lower end of the government s 2019 target range of 6 6 5 percent and would mark the weakest pace of growth china has seen in 29 years it would also spell a further deceleration from 6 6 percent in 2018 and 6 8 percent in 2017 growth next year will likely cool further to 6 0 percent the poll showed trade uncertainty beijing has been relying on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the current slowdown including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies but the economy has been slow to respond and investors fear a longer and costlier trade war between the world s two largest economies could trigger a global recession u s president donald trump told counterpart xi jinping late last month that he is putting threatened additional levies on hold as they agreed to get trade negotiations back on track but washington sharply raised tariffs on 200 billion of goods from china in may which remain in force and no timeframe was set for the talks capital economics believes china s fiscal policy will become even more supportive which would be most likely achieved by relaxing constraints on off budget borrowing we now expect our estimates of the augmented fiscal deficit which includes off budget borrowing to widen in the coming quarters and average 8 percent of gdp this year up from 6 4 percent in 2018 the government has announced a rise in its budget deficit to 2 8 percent of gdp this year from 2 6 percent in 2018 vendors sell preserved food at a market in chengdu of sichuan province china on jan 23 2005 china made pork products were detected african swine fever virus in several countries china photos getty images most measures expected analysts in the latest reuters poll expect the people s bank of china pboc will ease policy further this year but they do not expect it to cut its benchmark lending rate as it repeatedly did in past downturns separately some other china watchers have recently raised the possibility of cut in the pboc s benchmark or one of its short term rates if the u s central bank starts easing policy as soon as this month the pboc has slashed banks reserve requirement ratio rrr six times since early 2018 to turn around soft credit growth it has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short term interest rates lower analysts forecast two more rrr cuts of 50 basis points each in this quarter and the last quarter economists expect the central bank to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4 35 percent through at least the end of 2020 the poll also predicted annual consumer inflation will pick up to 2 3 percent in 2019 quickening from 2 1 percent estimate in the april survey but below the government target of around 3 percent data this week showed china s producer prices stalled in june while consumer price growth reached a 15 month high as supply shortages triggered by the african swine fever outbreak and extreme weather continued to push up pork and fruit prices by lusha zhang and kevin yao
it may be the case that more deaths occur in mexico due to sugary drinks than violent crime roughly 15 649 murders were official recorded in 2014 compared to an estimated 24 000 deaths associated with soda consumption in mexico it used to be that a heavy rounded body frame was a sign of wealth now it is a sign of poverty early last year policymakers imposed a 10 percent tax increase on the alleged culprit sugary drinks the average mexican drinks the equivalent of 163 liters of coca cola a year nearly half a liter a day while 70 percent of the population is overweight and 32 8 percent is clinically obese according to the world health organization this is due in large part to its soda consumption according to a new study published by the american heart association in the journal circulation mexico s death rate from diabetes cancer and cardiovascular disease is 405 per million adults the largest of any country advertisement for coca cola the difficulties in mexico have not been confined to the policy realm in the state of guerrero where 43 ayotzinapa students disappeared last year the company has been subject to kidnappings by militant student protestors and extortion by organized crime citing security concerns for its workers 120 of whom were recently laid off the company has decided to shutter a storage facility in the municipality of arcelia the facility was one of the few sources of formal sector jobs in the area coca cola femsa the largest franchise coca cola bottling company in the world similarly opted to pull its distribution center out of iguala in addition 10 percent of the city s 400 businesses registered with mexico s national chamber of trade services and tourism have shut their doors due to safety threats as coca cola comes under pressure on the health and security fronts the role of the company and other multinational corporations operating in mexico must be reevaluated given the latest statistics on the health risks of soda consumption the real benefits of coca cola s presence in the country are being questioned coca cola femsa consolidation coca cola femsa is part of the mexican conglomerate femsa which holds 47 9 percent economic interest and 63 percent voting interest in the bottling company the triple class stock equity structure meanwhile grants coca cola a 28 1 percent economic interest and voting interest of 37 percent in coca cola femsa while public shareholders have a combined 24 percent economic interest and no voting power while femsa has consolidated much of the global coke system particularly in latin america its profits derive mainly from markets in mexico where it serves about 69 3 million inhabitants upwards of 60 percent of the population however the government s recent levy on soda precipitated a 4 6 percent volume contraction in sales in mexico according to femsa s annual report for 2014 meanwhile the company reduced its investment in the country by nearly a third in that same year taxing soda advertisement with the implementation of a 10 percent sin tax on sugary drinks in january 2014 about a 1 peso 7 cent increase per liter coca cola and other soda behemoths have begun to worry about a resulting decline in demand according to a preliminary study by the mexican national institute of public health and the carolina population center at the university of north carolina chapel hill the tax is working researchers analyzing data on household consumption in 53 cities found that soda purchases dropped by 6 percent on average in 2014 relative to pretax trends and by 12 percent in december 2014 analysts adjusted for other factors such as the downward trend in soda consumption wages and unemployment the evaluation further suggests that the tax is regressive and largely targets the lowest income households within this demographic consumption decreased by an average of 9 percent over 12 months and 17 percent in the latter months of 2014 this was a 50 percent greater decline than the national average as a result these families will be less likely to have to deal with costly health expenditures or lost productivity due to diabetes and other ailments meanwhile the soda tax has created a windfall in revenue for the government a sum of 18 billion pesos or 1 5 billion usd which officials say will fund initiatives such as the provision of clean drinking water in schools this is particularly important considering that mexican officials have acknowledged that a large portion of the population about 46 5 percent consumes soft drinks because they have little or no access to potable water in their communities ayotzinapa revisited advertisement though femsa remains a key asset to coca cola s 20 billion usd portfolio of brands its presence in turbulent guerrero has been risky the climate of unrest has coca cola executives mounting a wholesale retreat much of this instability is the fallout from the disappearance of a number of students from the ayotzinapa escuela normal in iguala last year around 9 30 p m on september 26 2014 then mayor josé luis abarca ordered the municipal police to arrest students from the teacher training college who were protesting education reforms the police subsequently seized their buses and shot at them leaving several dead before handing another 43 students over to guerreros unidos an organized criminal syndicate the lack of an active and comprehensive investigation by the government immediately following the incident sparked protests by concerned individuals and civic groups in mexico and throughout much of the world the people of guerrero weary of endemic corruption throughout the various tiers of administration are searching for solutions to the violence gripping the state in may of this year 14 were killed in 72 hours in iguala while 28 people were murdered in acapulco in the week leading up to july 16 as faith in government transparency falters so too does a regard for the private institutions that were once insulated by the rule of law while federal police try to maintain a functioning security apparatus the presence of guerrero s foreign companies has complicated the struggle between local cartels law enforcement and citizen militias in february of this year three student protestors hijacked a coca cola delivery truck and kidnapped two of its employees in the southern city of chilpancingo before being arrested following the arrest a group of students known as the frente unido de normales públicas del estado de guerrero united front of public normal schools of guerrero state and a small teacher s union sympathetic to the ayotzinapa movement attacked coca cola s offices with molotov cocktails they then kidnapped two of its employees in order to broker a negotiated release as a result femsa closed its distribution center in chilpancingo firing 600 employees this and other withdrawals in iguala and arcelia are a sign of the degree of insecurity in guerrero foreign direct investment has been on the ebb with a number of other multinationals outsourcing their operations most notably german automaker volkswagen cement manufacturer canteras de méxico and spanish automaker seat though the belgium based mining company nyrstar nv employed some 380 workers at their reserve and was expanding at a rate of about 200 million usd per quarter the extraction process ultimately became too precarious leading to their pullout coca cola s woes in the state however reflect deep structural problems according to nathaniel flannery of forbes over the twenty years since mexico signed nafta guerrero has seen little meaningful economic development it is the country s second poorest state scoring lowest on the united nation s human development index long term growth rates run below average and eight out of ten residents work in the informal economy rural schools are acutely underfunded with eight out of ten of the state s schools lack access to the internet and a fifth of schools lack electricity assessing the impacts as protestors have disrupted business as usual on the more granular level they inadvertently carried out the state s initiative to curb coke s influence without any mechanism for distribution it has become more difficult for the residents of guerrero to find their soda fix of course there are more serious and immediate threats jeopardizing the state organized crime graft limited press freedom and social unrest however coca cola s pullout raises important questions about corporate social responsibility as well as the way mexican policymakers should treat foreign investment there is no doubt that since the 1970s coca cola has become an iconic u s export with an impressive supply infrastructure it reaches virtually all parts of the globe and aligns itself with dependable markets and lucrative promotional events this however has had an unfortunate impact on public health as an artificial beverage rich in calories and scarce in nutrients coca cola has bent foreign consumer preference toward an unhealthy but readily available option as the largest consumer of coca cola mexico is the most evident victim of this dietary shift though the company provides formal sector employment as was the case in iguala and arcelia it manufactures a processed product that harms the vast majority of the population in the form of poor health obesity kidney failure hypertension lower metabolism levels and teeth and bone damage it may well be then that the costs outweigh the benefits policymakers and their constituents have taken note of the benefits of the soda tax despite arguments to the contrary by beverage lobbyists in fact public health sources such as the british medical association and the nutritional health alliance are now pushing for an increase from 10 to 20 percent that is not to say that poor lifestyle choices are not also to blame however it is certainly problematic when a foreign company targets populations in low and middle income countries who lack in nutritional education and now account for 75 percent of global soda related deaths in mexico where about half of the population lives below the poverty line the wide availability of coke products compounds an already acute dietary problem whereas the country had been subject to malnutrition in decades prior inexpensive yet unhealthy food options have led to the higher prevalence of obesity in the lower income brackets though coca cola s trucks have stopped delivering in certain communities in guerrero residents will likely find a way to buy in bulk through third party sources the love affair with coke remains a fact both in guerrero and in the nation at large in fact coca cola femsa sold 164 million cases of beverages in its mexico market in 2014 61 percent of which were soda sales however if regressive tax policy grassroots campaigns marketing regulations and better labeling begin to change public opinion the principle of good dietary health may well become the practice nationwide by nick gonzalez research associate at the council on hemispheric affairs article first appeared at

financial markets are eagerly awaiting the beginning of the fed s easing cycle while the us economy enters the 11th year in the current expansion global economic slowdown worries a neverending trade war and deflationary pressures have the fed poised to deliver an insurance cut this month and possibly more in the following meetings to ensure a soft landing the most anticipated event of the week is fed chair powell s two days of testimony on capitol hill despite a robust labor market the us economy is slowing down as global growth concerns remain elevated as trade tensions show no immediate signs of easing equities could fall under pressure if powell commits to only one rate cut and if he is content on waiting to see if inflation continues to stabilize and if the risks to the economy

negotiations over the phone in what is expected to shortly yield an in person meeting both sides are politically motivated to wrap this up china initially thought they would be better waiting out trump but now that it seems he is likely to get re elected china will try to persuade him to agree on more purchases of us goods in exchange for the limited changes on structural reform cad bank of

economy is in need for stimulus inflation and gdp remain strong while the consumer and trade have softened currently markets are pricing in a 24 chance of a rate cut at the october 30th meeting

by reuters by lusha zhang and kevin yao beijing reuters china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 this year a reuters poll showed on wednesday despite a flurry of support measures to spur domestic demand amid a bruising trade war with the united states the median forecast was unchanged from the last poll in april but a stream of downbeat data in recent months and higher u s tariffs have fanned expectations that beijing will need to roll out more stimulus soon to ward off a sharper slowdown that could stoke job losses second quarter growth was seen cooling to 6 2 from a year earlier the same as in the previous poll from 6 4 in the first quarter china will post its second quarter gross domestic product gdp on july 15 most of the 72 institutions covered in the survey expect growth will remain at 6 2 for the rest of this year compared with expectations for a tick up to 6 3 in the previous poll zhang yiping senior economist at merchants securities in shenzhen said he expected the u s tariff hike in may on 200 billion 160 billion of chinese goods to weigh on growth in the second half but zhang said authorities are likely to stick to more moderate policy easing rather than resorting to more aggressive measures we expect policy this year would focus more on building a floor to underpin the economy rather than to boost growth he said so far china s stimulus measures have been more restrained than in past downturns which analysts attribute to fears of adding to a mountain of debt left over from past credit binges but the central bank governor reportedly said last month that there is tremendous room to adjust policy if the trade war worsens the full year forecast would be nearing the lower end of the government s 2019 target range of 6 6 5 and would mark the weakest pace of growth china has seen in 29 years it would also spell a further deceleration from 6 6 in 2018 and 6 8 in 2017 growth next year will likely cool further to 6 0 the poll showed trade uncertainty beijing has been relying on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the current slowdown including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies but the economy has been slow to respond and investors fear a longer and costlier trade war between the world s two largest economies could trigger a global recession advertisement u s president donald trump told counterpart xi jinping late last month that he is putting threatened additional levies on hold as they agreed to get trade negotiations back on track but washington sharply raised tariffs on 200 billion of goods from china in may which remain in force and no timeframe was set for the talks trade frictions would remain in the long run despite the truce reached last month we expect the standoff to morph into more forms such as a tech war to put further strain on china s economy zhang added capital economics believes china s fiscal policy will become even more supportive which would be most likely achieved by relaxing constraints on off budget borrowing we now expect our estimates of the augmented fiscal deficit which includes off budget borrowing to widen in the coming quarters and average 8 of gdp this year up from 6 4 in 2018 advertisement the government has announced a rise in its budget deficit to 2 8 of gdp this year from 2 6 in 2018 more measures expected analysts in the latest reuters poll expect the people s bank of china pboc will ease policy further this year but they do not expect it to cut its benchmark lending rate as it repeatedly did in past downturns advertisement separately some other china watchers have recently raised the possibility of cut in the pboc s benchmark or one of its short term rates if the u s central bank starts easing policy as soon as this month the pboc has slashed banks reserve requirement ratio rrr six times since early 2018 to turn around soft credit growth it has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short term interest rates lower analysts forecast two more rrr cuts of 50 basis points each in this quarter and the last quarter economists expect the central bank to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4 35 percent through at least the end of 2020 the poll also predicted annual consumer inflation will pick up to 2 3 in 2019 quickening from 2 1 estimate in the april survey but below the government target of around 3 advertisement data this week showed china s producer prices stalled in june while consumer price growth reached a 15 month high as supply shortages triggered by the african swine fever outbreak and extreme weather continued to push up pork and fruit prices this story has been refiled to correct a word in second subhead making it more measures expected polling by khushboo mittal and anisha sheth reporting by lusha zhang and kevin yao editing by kim coghill

washington pakistan s economy is at a critical juncture where it needs an ambitious and bold set of reforms the imf has said days after the global lender agreed to give a usd 6 billion bailout package to the cash strapped country pakistan which currently has a currency reserve of less than usd 8 billion enough to cover only 1 7 months of imports approached the washington based international monetary fund imf in august 2018 for a bailout package after the imran khan government took over the imf last week formally approved the usd 6 billion loan to pakistan which is facing significant economic challenges on the back of large fiscal and financial needs and weak and unbalanced growth pakistan is facing significant economic challenges on the back of large fiscal and financial needs and weak and unbalanced growth david lipton first deputy managing director and acting chair of the imf executive board said last week the imf approved the 13th bailout package for pakistan since the late 1980s the latest bailout package is worth usd 6 billion of which usd 1 billion is to be disbursed immediately and the rest in the next three years a decisive fiscal consolidation is key to reducing the large public debt and building resilience and the adoption of the fiscal year 2020 budget is an important initial step lipton said achieving the fiscal objectives will require a multi year revenue mobilisation strategy to broaden the tax base and raise tax revenue in a well balanced and equitable manner he said it will also require a strong commitment by the provinces to support the consolidation effort and effective public financial management to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending he said observing that protecting the most vulnerable from the impact of adjustment policies will be an important priority lipton said that this will be achieved by a significant increase in resources allocated to key social assistance programmes supporting measures for the economic empowerment of women and investment in areas where poverty is high a flexible market determined exchange rate and an adequately tight monetary policy will be key to correcting imbalances rebuilding reserves and keeping inflation low he said adding that an ambitious agenda to strengthen institutions and remove impediments to growth will allow pakistan to reach its full economic potential in an accompanying report the imf said that pakistan s economy is at a critical juncture the legacy of misaligned economic policies including large fiscal deficits loose monetary policy and defence of an overvalued exchange rate fuelled consumption and short term growth in recent years but steadily eroded macroeconomic buffers increased external and public debt and depleted international reserves structural weaknesses remained largely unaddressed including a chronically weak tax administration a difficult business environment inefficient and loss making state owned enterprises amid a large informal economy without urgent policy action economic and financial stability could be at risk and growth prospects will be insufficient to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population the imf said the fund supported programme is expected to coalesce broader support from multilateral and bilateral creditors in excess of usd 38 billion which is crucial for pakistan to meet its large financing needs in the coming years it added pakistan has so far received billions in financial aid packages from friendly countries like china saudi arabia and the uae during the current fiscal year get all latest business news market news income tax news share market sensex today live updates on times now more less

the bank of canada has begun to count the potential costs of escalating trade wars on the nation s economy in a series of analyses released wednesday as part of a rate decision in which tensions featured prominently here are how their scenarios play out immediate the trade war is already creating an 18 billion crater in the canadian economy according to the central bank the fallout from higher tariffs between the u s and china prompted the bank of canada to increase its estimate for how much the enduring clash over cross border commerce is weighing on domestic and global exports as well as business investment relative to april these negative effects plus china s import restrictions on canadian canola and meat more than offset the positive impact from the withdrawal of american tariffs on steel and aluminum and optimism surrounding the passage of the renegotiated north american free trade agreement this uncertainty means canadian exports will be 1 5 per cent lower by the end of 2021 than would otherwise be the case and capital spending will be curbed by 3 per cent over the same time frame the bank said bank of canada maintains key rate at 1 75 the bank of canada has kept its key interest rate on hold citing strong domestic performance in the face of a global slowdown frances donald chief economist at manulife asset management and luke kawa of bloomberg news provide breaking analysis medium term the quarterly monetary policy report also mapped out estimates for how much better or worse the picture could get as the situation evolves trade conflict remains the top risk to the central bank s outlook although it s a two sided concern the potential effects are asymmetric and canada is twice as exposed to the swings as the world at large if all protectionist measures were rolled back and the uncertainty surrounding the multilateral trading order disappeared global activity would be roughly 1 per cent higher by the end of 2021 relative to current forecasts and the canadian economy would be about 2 per cent larger yet in an all out trade war in which every country in the world were to impose 25 per cent levies on imported goods the canadian economy would be 6 per cent smaller relative to the base case with the global economy taking a 3 per cent hit the simulation suggests commodity prices would fall by 30 per cent while the canadian dollar depreciates by 25 per cent protectionism is difficult for monetary policy to respond to policy makers said as the negative supply shock entails higher prices but lower activity longer term a staff analytical note released alongside the mpr on wednesday shows how the u s is more insulated from the harshest trade war scenarios than its neighbours if every country in the world were to impose 25 per cent levies on imported goods the u s economy would take a long run hit of 1 1 per cent compared to 3 1 per cent for canada and 2 8 per cent for mexico weigh in what does the bank of canada s tone mean for you results total results 0 these results are consistent with what the literature has found as gains from trade for this relatively closed nation bank of canada economist karyne charbonneau said in the analysis it contrasts with the magnitude for small open economies such as canada and mexico the conclusion also bears some resemblance to sentiments espoused by president donald trump who has pointed to american deficits as a sign that the nation s trading partners have a greater reliance on the u s than vice versa short run impacts could be very different charbonneau warns as supply chain reorientation would likely displace workers in affected sectors the analysis also omits certain channels such as changes to productivity that could influence the outcome perversely a separate simulation shows canada and mexico could stand to benefit from a u s led trade war against the world that it excludes its continental counterparts these bystanders would see their exports become relatively more attractive as they substitute for american goods on the world markets charbonneau writes which both enjoying modest increases in estimated long run activity

argentina s foreign minister fought back tears president maurico macri called it the most important agreement ever signed in our history latin america s biggest economy would soon be reborn predicted a top aide to brazilian president jair bolsonaro who likewise heralded the great day the june 28 deal between the european union and mercosur was a breakthrough who knew that even as china and the united states played chicken with international trade 31 nations with a tenth of world population and a fourth of its wealth would agree to abide by global rules and swap goods freely across the atlantic in reality of course the mercosur eu pact is a decades long work in progress in which interests and ideologies will continue to clash on both sides of the equator contrarian parliaments bell jar industries organised labour and environmental backsliding could still delay dilute or neuter the agreement a hint of those difficulties emerged last week when norway and germany warned they might scrap funding for the amazon fund for conservation if brazilian authorities fell back on commitments to halt deforestation in the world s largest rainforest a major caveat in the trade agreement yet even before the first containers roll duty free into the new trade zone latin america comes out the big winner little traction historically free trade has found little traction in the southern flank of the americas its rare champions were seen as turncoats in service to flagless neoliberals and carpetbaggers in the early 2000s the pink tide of left wing latin american governments swamped the admittedly washington led free trade area of the americas this aversion to open borders contaminated even the region s own wannabe common market launched in the early 90s by argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay as a south american trade zone mercosur soon devolved into a fair weather arrangement diminished by beggar thy neighbour nationalism safeguards anti dumping and countervailing duties the total value of goods trade within mercosur has remained flat for the last 15 years and actually fallen since 2011 according to the inter american development bank you have to look hard to find another trade agreement with as little intra zone growth as mercosur said guillermo tolosa executive director of the uruguayan think tank center for economic and social policy research critics are right to call it less a common market than an exercise in ceremonial regionalism its solipsism did not just stunt commerce it enfeebled industries that ought to have been steeled for global competition slackers on notice by eliminating import tariffs on the vast majority of two way trade 92 percent of mercosur s exports in 10 years and 92 percent of eurozone s goods within 15 years the new pact puts slackers on notice but also presents latin america with big opportunities there s great potential for brazil and argentina to upgrade productivity by importing technology said monica de bolle senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics this is an avenue for enhancing competitiveness brazilian and argentine agribusiness have long shown that given a level playing field they can feed the world they stand to win big once the eu trade deal sweeps away most of the lingering barriers in one of the world s most protected consumer markets under the agreement the eu will eliminate tariffs on 82 percent of mercosur orange juice fruit and coffee and raise quotas of tariff free beef sugar and ethanol over a decade the learning curve for other less competitive mercosur industries such as auto parts machines chemicals and pharmaceuticals will be steeper low skilled workers huge underperforming informal economies and chronic underinvestment in infrastructure keep the bar low for enterprise and competitiveness among mercosur partners brazilian economist armando castelar of the getúlio vargas foundation recently concluded that most off books companies probably survive only because they don t pay taxes the most inflexible labour regulations in latin america discourage job creation workplace training and productivity in argentina though recognised for its quality of life indicators uruguay has an economy that is cosseted by perks and subsidies in times of electronic fare cards almost half the bus fleet in montevideo still operates with manual ticket sellers to bankroll such obsolescence uruguay imposes a surtax on diesel fuel and transfers the takings to the bus companies the nation s outdated sugarcane industry is no better we could import ethanol from brazil at half the domestic price said tolosa instead we protect inefficient big producers and charge a higher price at the pump for gasohol this reflects how little mercosur has achieved shed historic indulgences under the new trade agreement such practices cannot stand much as brazil s accession to the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd requires rising to the competitiveness standards of the most advanced economies joining the eu trade pact means its partners must shed historic indulgences the difference is that failing to comply with trade agreement rules

by lusha zhang and kevin yao beijing july 10 reuters china s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low of 6 2 this year a reuters poll showed on wednesday despite a flurry of support measures to spur domestic demand amid a bruising trade war with the united states the median forecast was unchanged from the last poll in april but a stream of downbeat data in recent months and higher u s tariffs have fanned expectations that beijing will need to roll out more stimulus soon to ward off a sharper slowdown that could stoke job losses second quarter growth was seen cooling to 6 2 from a year earlier the same as in the previous poll from 6 4 in the first quarter china will post its second quarter gross domestic product gdp on july 15 most of the 72 institutions covered in the survey expect growth will remain at 6 2 for the rest of this year compared with expectations for a tick up to 6 3 in the previous poll zhang yiping senior economist at merchants securities in shenzhen said he expected the u s tariff hike in may on 200 billion of chinese goods to weigh on growth in the second half but zhang said authorities are likely to stick to more moderate policy easing rather than resorting to more aggressive measures we expect policy this year would focus more on building a floor to underpin the economy rather than to boost growth he said so far china s stimulus measures have been more restrained than in past downturns which analysts attribute to fears of adding to a mountain of debt left over from past credit binges but the central bank governor reportedly said last month that there is tremendous room to adjust policy if the trade war worsens the full year forecast would be nearing the lower end of the government s 2019 target range of 6 6 5 and would mark the weakest pace of growth china has seen in 29 years it would also spell a further deceleration from 6 6 in 2018 and 6 8 in 2017 growth next year will likely cool further to 6 0 the poll showed trade uncertainty beijing has been relying on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the current slowdown including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies but the economy has been slow to respond and investors fear a longer and costlier trade war between the world s two largest economies could trigger a global recession u s president donald trump told counterpart xi jinping late last month that he is putting threatened additional levies on hold as they agreed to get trade negotiations back on track but washington sharply raised tariffs on 200 billion of goods from china in may which remain in force and no timeframe was set for the talks trade frictions would remain in the long run despite the truce reached last month we expect the standoff to morph into more forms such as a tech war to put further strain on china s economy zhang added capital economics believes china s fiscal policy will become even more supportive which would be most likely achieved by relaxing constraints on off budget borrowing we now expect our estimates of the augmented fiscal deficit which includes off budget borrowing to widen in the coming quarters and average 8 of gdp this year up from 6 4 in 2018 the government has announced a rise in its budget deficit to 2 8 of gdp this year from 2 6 in 2018 more measures expected analysts in the latest reuters poll expect the people s bank of china pboc will ease policy further this year but they do not expect it to cut its benchmark lending rate as it repeatedly did in past downturns separately some other china watchers have recently raised the possibility of cut in the pboc s benchmark or one of its short term rates if the u s central bank starts easing policy as soon as this month the pboc has slashed banks reserve requirement ratio rrr six times since early 2018 to turn around soft credit growth it has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short term interest rates lower analysts forecast two more rrr cuts of 50 basis points each in this quarter and the last quarter economists expect the central bank to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4 35 percent through at least the end of 2020 the poll also predicted annual consumer inflation will pick up to 2 3 in 2019 quickening from 2 1 estimate in the april survey but below the government target of around 3 data this week showed china s producer prices stalled in june while consumer price growth reached a 15 month high as supply shortages triggered by the african swine fever outbreak and extreme weather continued to push up pork and fruit prices for other stories from the economic outlook polls polling by khushboo mittal and anisha sheth reporting by lusha zhang and kevin yao editing by kim coghill

good day and thanks for joining us for today s conference call today we reported net sales of 114 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 up nearly 7 compared to the third quarter of last year net income for the third quarter was 18 1 million compared to 16 1 million last year reflecting an increase of 12 year over year diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were 1 30 compared to 1 15 for the same period last year and i m happy to share with you that both sales and earnings results for the third quarter reflect new records for the company now let s start with the discussion about our strategic initiatives and the brands that support them we aspire to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2025 and to do so while following our 55 30 25 business model we d like to remind investors that these long term targets are guide posts not guidance they are probably wrong and roughly right however our tribe is working tirelessly on programs and initiatives that will help us successfully reach our 2025 aspirations as a reminder we refer to the brands that are going to get us there as our 2025 brands they are wd 40 multi use product wd 40 specialist 3 in one wd 40 bike gt85 1001 spot shot solvol lava and no vac our 2025 brands are our core strategic focus and the primary growth engine for our company our strategic initiative number one is to grow wd 40 multi use product our goal under this initiative is to make the blue and yellow can with a little red top available to more people in more places who will find more uses more often we aspire to grow the wd 40 multi use product to approximately 530 million in revenue by the end of 2025 in the third quarter sales of wd 40 multi use product were 88 4 million up 7 compared to last year the growth was driven by solid sales in both emea and asia pacific as well as a reasonable growth in our largest market the united states in our developed markets we continue to drive revenue growth through the innovation of our flagship product which includes premiumization as part of our premiumization strategy we continue to successfully convert wd 40 multi product end users to a more innovative smart straw and ez reach delivery systems in our developing and emerging markets we continue to build brand awareness and drive geographic expansion and higher availability around the globe year to date net sales of products included under this initiative were up 4 compared to last year strategic initiative number two is grow the wd 40 specialist product line in the third quarter sales of wd 40 specialist were 9 1 million up 8 compared to the third quarter of last year this continues to move the company toward its goal for the initiative growing the product line to approximately 100 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025 we re optimistic about the long term opportunities for wd 40 specialist however there may be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution and the various other factors that come along with building out a new product line year to date net sales of products included under this initiative were up 10 compared to last year strategic initiative number 3 is to broaden product and revenue base strategic initiative number 3 includes maintenance products like 3 in one wd 40 bike and gt85 but also includes such brands as spot shot and lava in the americas 1001 in emea and no vac and solvol in asia pacific we believe we are on track to reach a combined revenue for these products of approximately 70 million by 2025 global sales of products included under this initiative were 14 2 million in the third quarter compared to 13 7 million in the third quarter of last year reflecting an increase of 4 period over period year to date net sales of products under this initiative were up 3 compared to last year nearly all of the growth is attributed to the strong sales of 1001 carpet fresh in the uk due to the favorable impacts of some digital marketing windfalls associated with the brand strategic initiative number 4 is to attract develop and retain outstanding tribe members our goal under this initiative is to attract develop and retain talented tribe members and to grow tribe member engagement to greater than 95 the number one responsibility of our tribal leaders is to share knowledge and inspire ongoing learning with that end in mind we recently refreshed our internal learning program and renamed it learning laboratory which is our global ecosystem for tribal learning and development through the lab we create and deliver learning and encompass skills sales skills technical product knowledge leadership and general competencies we strongly believe in strengthening our tribe from within because building a strong bench of great talent and future leaders is critical to our continued success we are fortunate to have a tremendous depth of talent throughout all ranks of the company and a strong succession plan in place to further ensure the continuation of culture and the success of our company we announced last month that steve brass has been appointed to the role of president and chief operating officer of the company and patricia olsem has been promoted to the role of division president americas in conjunction with steve s appointment i will no longer serve as president but i ll continue to serve as the chief executive officer of the company in addition to these management changes we shared with investors that linda lang will retire as a director and as chair of the company s board at the next annual general meeting in december 2019 and at that time the board intends to appoint me as board chair i m very excited about taking on this latest responsibility and for the opportunity to mentor the future leaders of this great organization strategic initiative number 5 operational excellence inaudible this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at wd 40 company make it better than it is today we are continuously focused on optimizing resources systems and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance regulatory compliance intellectual property protection recently we held two global summits one in san diego and one in our brand new technology center in pine brook new jersey in san diego members of our global quality tribe gathered together to gain an alignment on topics related to quality insurance innovation and regulatory compliance in pine brook our scientists human resource and supply chain tribe members gathered together with some of our key suppliers to collaborate and gain alignment on some of our global opportunities and challenges that our tribe is facing these summits are a living breathing example of our tribe consistently striving to make it better than it is today that completes the update on the strategic initiatives so let s move on to the details of our third quarter results starting with sales as i mentioned earlier consolidated net sales were 114 million in the third quarter up 7 year over year which reflects a new record for the company translation of foreign currency subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the u s dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales in the third quarter on a constant currency basis net sales would have been 117 5 million in the third quarter up 10 compared to the last year and resulting in a diluted earnings per share of 1 35 before i discuss what s happening in the individual segments i d like to take a moment to remind investors that though we do not consider our business to be a seasonal one it s common for our sales results to fluctuate from one period to another due to various factors including the level of promotional activities specific programs being run at customer locations the timing of customer orders or the impact of new product launches this is all a normal part of our business and we are accustomed to these types of fluctuations and manage them as part of our normal business activities just when something out of the ordinary happens that we will discuss the event in much greater detail here with investors so now let s start with the americas net sales in the americas which includes the united states latin america and canada remain constant at 53 million in the third quarter compared to last year year to date net sales in the americas were also relatively flat compared to last year sales of maintenance products increased 1 with 369 000 in the americas entirely due to the higher sales of maintenance products in the united states the increase in sales in the united states was nearly all offset by lower sales of maintenance products in canada and latin america maintenance products sales in the united states increased 6 in the third quarter primarily due to increased sales of the wd 40 specialist sales of wd 40 specialist were up 30 in the u s due to new distribution and successful promotional activities sales of wd 40 multi use product in the u s were up 3 compared to last year due to the successful promotional programs being run this increase in sales in the u s was quite an achievement considering that the third quarter of last year many of our customers were buying products in advance of our planned price increases the increase in maintenance product sales in the u s were significantly offset by decreases in sales in both canada and latin america year over year sales in canada were down 18 and sales in latin america down 16 this is because we were up against tough comparable periods both in canada and latin america as customers in the prior year bought high volumes of product in advance of our planned price increases as a reminder our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the americas decreased 8 in the third quarter compared to the prior year largely due to the lower sales of 2000 flushes and spot shot which declined 6 and 10 respectively we continue to consider homecare and cleaning products except for those listed as 2025 brands as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows but i generally expect it to become a smaller part of the business over time in total the america segment made up 47 of our global business and over the long term we anticipate sales within this segment will grow between 2 and 5 annually now on to emea net sales in emea which includes europe the middle east africa and india increased to 44 5 million in the third quarter up 13 from last year year to date net sales in emea were up 9 compared to last year emea s reported results in the third quarter were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales in emea would have increased to 47 3 million in the third quarter up 20 from last year translation related impacts were immaterial in the quarter as you know we sell into emea through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors our emea direct markets accounted for 68 of the region sales during the third quarter of this year in u s dollars sales in our direct markets were 30 1 million up nearly 16 compared to last year primarily due to strong sales of wd 40 multi use product this increase in sales was primarily due to higher levels of promotional activities and increased distribution of our wd 40 ez reach flexible straw product in addition sales in the uk direct markets increased significantly due to higher sales of 1001 carpet fresh as the result of favorable impacts from digital marketing windfalls associated with the brand net sales in our emea distributor markets which accounted for 32 of the region sales increased by 7 during the quarter to 14 4 million this increase was primarily due to the increased sales of wd 40 multi use product in eastern europe primarily russia due to the timing of customer orders and more stable economic conditions in the region the emea segment made up 39 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 8 and 10 annually now to asia consolidated net sales in asia pacific which includes australia china and other countries in the asian region increased to 16 5 million in the third quarter up 14 from last year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in asia pacific would have increased to 17 1 million in the third quarter up 18 from last year in australia net sales were 4 2 million in the third quarter down 11 compared to last year primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had a negative impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in australia were down 3 compared to the same quarter of last year primarily due to a lower level of promotional activities in our asia distributor markets net sales were 8 3 million for the quarter up 50 compared to last year this increase in sales was driven by success from promotional programs as well as the timing of customers orders it s worth noting that in the comparable period last year sales in asia distributor markets were negatively impacted due to the transitioning of distributor partners in some of the region that transition has been completed for quite some time but due to the disruption last year the comparable period looks particularly strong year over year our asia distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell in u s dollars in that region in china net sales in u s dollars decreased to 3 9 million in the third quarter down 6 compared to last year primarily due to unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales would have remained constant year to date net sales in china increased 11 8 million up 6 compared to last year we remain optimistic about the long term opportunities in china although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities the asia pacific region made up 14 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 10 and 12 annually that wraps up my part of the report for today now over to jay who ll continue with the review of the financials jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks garry let s first start with the discussion about our 55 30 25 business model the long term targets that we use to guide our business as you may recall the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55 of net sales the 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization our goal is to drive our cost of doing business toward 30 of net sales over time and finally the 25 represents our target for ebitda well first the 55 are our gross margin in the third quarter our gross margin was 54 5 compared to 54 8 last year this represents a decrease of 30 basis points year over year sales of exchanges and other miscellaneous costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 160 basis points this period this is driven by a combination of unfavorable mix changes and increases in miscellaneous costs primarily in our americas and emea segments also negatively impacting gross margin by 50 basis points this quarter were changes in major input costs approximately 20 basis points came from increased cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals while the remaining 30 basis points came from higher cost associated with aerosol cans when we last updated investors we shared that we anticipated gross margin would begin to show a slight positive trend driven by the lower petroleum based input costs while we ve seen this in the americas the cost increases we experienced in emea and asia pacific more than offset these savings even though the cost of crude oil was lower the cost in emea and asia pacific for some of the petroleum based specialty chemicals we procure have increased as a result the average cost of raw materials has flowed through our cost of goods in the third quarter was higher this year and this has put pressure on our gross margin these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were mostly offset by the effect of sales price increases which we ve implemented in all three trading blocks over the last 12 months and positively impacted gross margin by 120 basis points in the third quarter also positively impacting margin in the third quarter by 30 basis points were lower manufacturing warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily in asia pacific we ve made some changes to our supply chain for our asia pacific distributor markets in late fiscal year 2018 and we re now beginning to see some of the benefits from these changes gross margin also positively impacted by lower advertising promotional and other discounts which we give to our customers and positively impacted gross margin results by 20 basis points and finally changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our emea segment positively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points as a reminder our long term gross margin target of 55 is not contingent upon commodity prices staying at any particular price point cannot control global market dynamics but we can continue to be deliberate and focused in managing our business so that we can maintain gross margin at or above our target of 55 over the long term now i ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business in the third quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 33 up 10 basis points from the third quarter last year for the third quarter 75 of our cost of doing business came from three areas people costs or the investments we make in our tribe the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales or a p investment was 5 5 in the third quarter and then finally freight the cost to get our products to our customers while our objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30 of net sales we ll continue to make necessary investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence and this brings us to ebitda the last of our 55 30 25 measures ebitda was 22 of net sales for the third quarter and down from the 23 last year and that completes the discussion on our 55 30 25 business model now let s discuss some items that fall below the line the provision for income taxes was 19 8 in the third quarter of this year compared to 24 3 last year the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the continued impact from the u s tax act and its effect on the company s fiscal year tax rate we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19 to 20 for the full fiscal year 2019 a little bit lower than we had previously anticipated and net income for the third quarter was 18 1 million versus 16 1 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 12 this resulted in diluted earnings per share of 1 30 for the third quarter compared to 1 15 for the same period last year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13 8 million shares from 13 9 million shares a year ago now a word about capital allocation our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long term growth while providing strong returns to our shareholders we continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases on june 18th 2019 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 61 per share payable july 31st to shareholders of record at the close of business on july 19th based on today s closing price of 161 35 the annualized dividend yield is 1 5 during the third quarter we repurchased approximately 62 000 shares of our stock at a total cost of 10 3 million under our current 75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the board in june 2018 at the end of our third fiscal quarter we had 52 6 million remaining under the plan as a reminder we target our maintenance capex of between 1 and 2 of net sales each year however this fiscal year we re making some additional investments that are expected to bring our total capital expenditures to around 22 million this investment is to support the renovation of our new facility in milton keynes and to procure some new production machinery as we ve previously disclosed so with that let s turn to fiscal year 2019 guidance as i mentioned we expect the provision for income tax to be a little bit lower than we previously anticipated due to the continued favorable impact from the u s tax cuts and jobs act as a result of a lower tax rate we are strengthening our net income and eps guidance for the full year we continue to expect net sales growth to be between 4 and 7 with net sales between 425 million and 437 million gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 55 advertising and promotion investment is projected to be between 5 5 and 6 of net sales the provision for income tax is expected to be between 19 and 20 with net income projected to be between 63 3 million and 64 4 million diluted earnings per share is expected to be between 4 58 and 4 65 based on an estimated 13 8 million weighted average shares outstanding i d like to remind investors that we continue to believe that net sales may come in at the lower end of the range that we ve shared with you today due to the impacts of fluctuating currency exchange rates in addition this guide does not include any expectations regarding future acquisitions or divestitures and that completes the financial overview and i ll turn it now back to garry garry o ridge chief executive officer hey thanks jay in summary what did you hear from us on the call today you heard that both our sales and earnings for the third quarter reflect new records for the company you heard that global sales of wd 40 multi use product were up 7 in the third quarter you heard that global sales of wd 40 specialist grew 8 in the third quarter you heard that we continue to increase penetration of smart straw and distribution of the wd 40 ez reach flexible you heard that linda lang has announced her retirement from our board of directors and that i expect to be stepping into her board chair position beginning in december you heard that we ve promoted steve brass to the role of president and chief operating officer and patricia olsem to the role of division president americas you heard that our net sales guidance remains unchanged but we have strengthened our guidance for net income and eps in closing i d like to share with you a quote today from anne mulcahy one of the things we often miss in succession planning is that it should be gradual and thoughtful with lots of sharing of information and knowledge and perspective so it s almost a nonevent when it happens thank you for joining us today and we d be pleased to open the conference call to your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from linda bolton weiser with d a davidson your line is open cindy ding d a davidson analyst hi this is cindy ding on for linda thanks for taking our questions so first did you see any shelf space changes at any retailer garry o ridge chief executive officer shelf space changes well no cindy ding d a davidson analyst okay garry o ridge chief executive officer no there was no change in our shelf distribution cindy ding d a davidson analyst okay thank you and then now that the gross margin is at around the 55 targeted level do you see potentials to get to a higher level going forward garry o ridge chief executive officer yeah as we ve always said we believe we do have upside on our gross margin and it will continue to be impacted as we roll out our premiumization strategy with things like smart straw the next generation of smart straw ez reach and as our specialist product range grows as a percentage of our overall revenue cindy ding d a davidson analyst great and as a follow up to that question are there any updates you can provide on the new smart straw system and when should we expect to learn about pricing and margin details garry o ridge chief executive officer the commercialization plan is currently being reviewed we expect that we would start seeing some of the next generation of smart straw into the market as we predicted sometime around the middle of next year and we ll keep you updated as we get closer cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you is the next calendar year garry o ridge chief executive officer yes cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you and then what are some initiatives to get the cost of doing business to 30 of sales garry o ridge chief executive officer the biggest driver for cost of business was increase of revenue we ve often said that it s really about getting leverage out of the infrastructure we have so as our revenue grows then you will see that that will have an impact on the cost of doing business ratio cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you that s all of our questions garry o ridge chief executive officer thank you very much operator your next question is from daniel rizzo with jefferies your line is open daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hi just to follow up on i think what you was talking about last call you mentioned that rotation at the warehouse was a headwind in the u s i think it was just some product rotation and i think that was being referred to in terms of shelf space is that still an issue now or that kind of ended garry o ridge chief executive officer in most cases we are through the impacts that we had around pricing but we continue to have opportunities to increase distribution across the club channel and through that first round we haven t lost any further distribution so again we would expect we ll rotate in as we were rotated out sometime in the future daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay and then i think you mentioned that that sales were strong in asia china was flat and australia was down a little bit i was just wondering what region you were seeing kind of the strength then i mean what specific country or area garry o ridge chief executive officer the biggest gain in the asia pacific region was through our distributor markets those are countries like malaysia singapore indonesia taiwan korea japan there s a few others but all of our distributor markets and this time last year we had a we had a period of time where we were changing our distributors in malaysia singapore and indonesia so that had a negative impact that s why there was such a large increase in the in the distributor markets australia primarily is due to currency we would expect that to australia to end up in growth in the year end we have no and as far as china is concerned we re very comfortable that we continue to grow at a reasonable rate in china as we build out the business to our long term plans daniel rizzo jefferies analyst is china more of a direct market at this point jay rembolt chief financial officer china is a direct market has been for 12 years daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay all right thank you for clarification and then finally just you mentioned tough comps in canada and i think latin america because of pre buying last year led to a big spike in the second quarter i m sorry in the third fiscal quarter i was wondering why that wasn t the case in the u s or was it and you just kind of overcame that jay rembolt chief financial officer correct it was and we overcame it in the u s i think i mentioned in the call that the results were particularly pleasing in the u s because we did have some buy up against price rise last year but our programs this year enabled us to come back and beat that in this fiscal year daniel rizzo jefferies analyst thank you very much jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks daniel operator your next question is from rosemarie morbelli with g research your line is open rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good afternoon everyone and congratulations to all the promotions and for the succession plan garry o ridge chief executive officer thank you rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so i was wondering if you could give us a better feel for pricing versus volume and what do you expect going forward for the balance of the year garry o ridge chief executive officer most of the gains that you ll see in the balance of the year are volume pricing has already been factored into our trading so jay i think that would be about correct jay rembolt chief financial officer for the remainder of the year yes yeah we don t see any additional pricing increases rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and do you see your raw material costs continuing to come down any change on the cans for example in addition to the petroleum garry o ridge chief executive officer actually cans have gone up there s probably some residual impact of tariffs even though we buy our cans in the u s in places very close to where we sell our product there has been some increase in can costs and it s somewhat coincident with the timing of tariffs rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and what do you hear in terms of tariff anecdotally by your customers in the different regions is the outlook kind of improving or is it the positiveness that one may have had a year ago is really has moved all the way into the negative territory jay rembolt chief financial officer i wouldn t say things have moved into the negative i think there is a continuing uncertainty out there you ve got a number of things that are impacting us at the moment the uncertainties around brexit the uncertainties around trade talks so we can as most companies and most people deal with risks they have a real problem dealing with uncertainty so that seems to be some of the area but i wouldn t say it s gone to negative i d say it s moderate rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and then lastly if i may you are looking at revenues being closer to the lower end of your expectations and the eps now lower and is your previous high end so is the benefit solely from the lower tax rate or are there other factors in between that are going to allow you to have a higher margin for intended ph purposes in order to get to those numbers garry o ridge chief executive officer it all comes from the change in tax for the most part rosemarie morbelli g research analyst nothing else no other benefits anywhere else garry o ridge chief executive officer there could be but it s too soon to tell rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay thank you jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our allotted time for questions we thank you for your participation on today s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line duration 38 minutes call participants wendy kelley director of investor relations and corporate communications garry o ridge chief executive officer jay rembolt chief financial officer cindy ding d a davidson analyst daniel rizzo jefferies analyst rosemarie morbelli g research analyst more wdfc

bitcoin is back on the radar in zimbabwe as the country s economy continues to struggle the cryptocurrency is trading briskly here after president emmerson mnangagwa s government banned the use of foreign currencies for settlement of local transactions advertisement it comes as zimbabwe re introduced the zimbabwe dollar unit it abandoned in 2009 and banned settlement of local transactions using the united states dollar british pound south african rand and other foreign currencies the government has been trying to curb re dollarization of the economy and apparently to tame growing pressure from workers unions demanding salary payments in foreign currency while the monetary policy measures introduced june 24 have taken effect across larger formal businesses they have also breathed fresh impetus to local trade in bitcoin leading to a rise in local prices for the digital currency the reserve bank of zimbabwe banned local banks from processing transactions involving bitcoin more than a year ago however crypto experts in zimbabwe say peer to peer trade in bitcoin is surging with mobile money platform ecocash being the dominant payment platform for bitcoin traders from inside the country tech savvy zimbabweans have long used bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to plug foreign currency and liquidity gaps that have plagued the country for the last decade so much so that the southern african country has been one of africa s most active markets for crypto transactions right now investors and speculators alike will be turning to bitcoin as a more stable storage of value than the new zimbabwe dollar which is still overwhelmed by uncertainty the price of bitcoin in local currency has surged according to the cryptocurrency s pricing list for zimbabwe on localbitcoins com advertisement over the past week traders have also been using paypal western union and moneybookers as settlement platforms using hard us dollar currency for bitcoin trades from outside the country at prices between 12 400 to around 12 700 this is mainly because zimbabweans can no longer use foreign fiat currencies to settle local transactions local mobile money service ecocash is being used for zimbabwe dollar bitcoin transactions bitcoin traders in zimbabwe are also accepting hard cash deposit among the options for payment with local crypto experts saying bitcoin trades are currently on a peer to peer level as there are no local exchanges facilitating cryptocurrency trades and transactions the central bank has clarified that free funds which include remittances and individual foreign currency accounts will still be accessible in hard currency while companies will not be allowed to withdraw hard foreign currency they have to exchange funds in their foreign currency accounts at the prevailing bank exchange rate and use the money in local currency what we are seeing is that there is a lot of demand for bitcoin tawanda kembo ceo and founder of the golix crypto exchange which was affected by the central bank s directive to ban exchanges from crypto trading and there is little supply compared to demand so all the activity in bitcoin which we are seeing is happening on dark markets instead of exchanges he added advertisement this means traders and facilitators in bitcoin trade are still processing a lot of transactions over the counter and on a peer to peer basis i don t know of any crypto exchanges that have any significant volume in bitcoin trades says kembo sign up to the quartz africa weekly brief here for news and analysis on african business tech and innovation in your inbox

o ridge chief executive officer thanks wendy good day and thanks for joining us for today s conference call today we reported net sales of 114 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 up nearly 7 compared to the third quarter of last year net income for the third quarter was 18 1 million compared to 16 1 million last year reflecting an increase of 12 year over year diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were 1 30 compared to 1 15 for the same period last year and i m happy to share with you that both sales and earnings results for the third quarter reflect new records for the company now let s start with the discussion about our strategic initiatives and the brands that support them we aspire to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2025 and to do so while following our 55 30 25 business model we d like to remind investors that these long term targets are guide posts not guidance they are probably wrong and roughly right however our tribe is working tirelessly on programs and initiatives that will help us successfully reach our 2025 aspirations as a reminder we refer to the brands that are going to get us there as our 2025 brands they are wd 40 multi use product wd 40 specialist 3 in one wd 40 bike gt85 1001 spot shot solvol lava and no vac our 2025 brands are our core strategic focus and the primary growth engine for our company our strategic initiative number one is to grow wd 40 multi use product our goal under this initiative is to make the blue and yellow can with a little red top available to more people in more places who will find more uses more often we aspire to grow the wd 40 multi use product to approximately 530 million in revenue by the end of 2025 in the third quarter sales of wd 40 multi use product were 88 4 million up 7 compared to last year the growth was driven by solid sales in both emea and asia pacific as well as a reasonable growth in our largest market the united states in our developed markets we continue to drive revenue growth through the innovation of our flagship product which includes premiumization as part of our premiumization strategy we continue to successfully convert wd 40 multi product end users to a more innovative smart straw and ez reach delivery systems in our developing and emerging markets we continue to build brand awareness and drive geographic expansion and higher availability around the globe year to date net sales of products included under this initiative were up 4 compared to last year strategic initiative number two is grow the wd 40 specialist product line in the third quarter sales of wd 40 specialist were 9 1 million up 8 compared to the third quarter of last year this continues to move the company toward its goal for the initiative growing the product line to approximately 100 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025 we re optimistic about the long term opportunities for wd 40 specialist however there may be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution and the various other factors that come along with building out a new product line year to date net sales of products included under this initiative were up 10 compared to last year strategic initiative number 3 is to broaden product and revenue base strategic initiative number 3 includes maintenance products like 3 in one wd 40 bike and gt85 but also includes such brands as spot shot and lava in the americas 1001 in emea and no vac and solvol in asia pacific we believe we are on track to reach a combined revenue for these products of approximately 70 million by 2025 global sales of products included under this initiative were 14 2 million in the third quarter compared to 13 7 million in the third quarter of last year reflecting an increase of 4 period over period year to date net sales of products under this initiative were up 3 compared to last year nearly all of the growth is attributed to the strong sales of 1001 carpet fresh in the uk due to the favorable impacts of some digital marketing windfalls associated with the brand strategic initiative number 4 is to attract develop and retain outstanding tribe members our goal under this initiative is to attract develop and retain talented tribe members and to grow tribe member engagement to greater than 95 the number one responsibility of our tribal leaders is to share knowledge and inspire ongoing learning with that end in mind we recently refreshed our internal learning program and renamed it learning laboratory which is our global ecosystem for tribal learning and development through the lab we create and deliver learning and encompass skills sales skills technical product knowledge leadership and general competencies we strongly believe in strengthening our tribe from within because building a strong bench of great talent and future leaders is critical to our continued success we are fortunate to have a tremendous depth of talent throughout all ranks of the company and a strong succession plan in place to further ensure the continuation of culture and the success of our company we announced last month that steve brass has been appointed to the role of president and chief operating officer of the company and patricia olsem has been promoted to the role of division president americas in conjunction with steve s appointment i will no longer serve as president but i ll continue to serve as the chief executive officer of the company in addition to these management changes we shared with investors that linda lang will retire as a director and as chair of the company s board at the next annual general meeting in december 2019 and at that time the board intends to appoint me as board chair i m very excited about taking on this latest responsibility and for the opportunity to mentor the future leaders of this great organization strategic initiative number 5 operational excellence inaudible this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at wd 40 company make it better than it is today we are continuously focused on optimizing resources systems and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance regulatory compliance intellectual property protection recently we held two global summits one in san diego and one in our brand new technology center in pine brook new jersey in san diego members of our global quality tribe gathered together to gain an alignment on topics related to quality insurance innovation and regulatory compliance in pine brook our scientists human resource and supply chain tribe members gathered together with some of our key suppliers to collaborate and gain alignment on some of our global opportunities and challenges that our tribe is facing these summits are a living breathing example of our tribe consistently striving to make it better than it is today that completes the update on the strategic initiatives so let s move on to the details of our third quarter results starting with sales as i mentioned earlier consolidated net sales were 114 million in the third quarter up 7 year over year which reflects a new record for the company translation of foreign currency subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the u s dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales in the third quarter on a constant currency basis net sales would have been 117 5 million in the third quarter up 10 compared to the last year and resulting in a diluted earnings per share of 1 35 before i discuss what s happening in the individual segments i d like to take a moment to remind investors that though we do not consider our business to be a seasonal one it s common for our sales results to fluctuate from one period to another due to various factors including the level of promotional activities specific programs being run at customer locations the timing of customer orders or the impact of new product launches this is all a normal part of our business and we are accustomed to these types of fluctuations and manage them as part of our normal business activities just when something out of the ordinary happens that we will discuss the event in much greater detail here with investors so now let s start with the americas net sales in the americas which includes the united states latin america and canada remain constant at 53 million in the third quarter compared to last year year to date net sales in the americas were also relatively flat compared to last year sales of maintenance products increased 1 with 369 000 in the americas entirely due to the higher sales of maintenance products in the united states the increase in sales in the united states was nearly all offset by lower sales of maintenance products in canada and latin america maintenance products sales in the united states increased 6 in the third quarter primarily due to increased sales of the wd 40 specialist sales of wd 40 specialist were up 30 in the u s due to new distribution and successful promotional activities sales of wd 40 multi use product in the u s were up 3 compared to last year due to the successful promotional programs being run this increase in sales in the u s was quite an achievement considering that the third quarter of last year many of our customers were buying products in advance of our planned price increases the increase in maintenance product sales in the u s were significantly offset by decreases in sales in both canada and latin america year over year sales in canada were down 18 and sales in latin america down 16 this is because we were up against tough comparable periods both in canada and latin america as customers in the prior year bought high volumes of product in advance of our planned price increases as a reminder our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the americas decreased 8 in the third quarter compared to the prior year largely due to the lower sales of 2000 flushes and spot shot which declined 6 and 10 respectively we continue to consider homecare and cleaning products except for those listed as 2025 brands as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows but i generally expect it to become a smaller part of the business over time in total the america segment made up 47 of our global business and over the long term we anticipate sales within this segment will grow between 2 and 5 annually now on to emea net sales in emea which includes europe the middle east africa and india increased to 44 5 million in the third quarter up 13 from last year year to date net sales in emea were up 9 compared to last year emea s reported results in the third quarter were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales in emea would have increased to 47 3 million in the third quarter up 20 from last year translation related impacts were immaterial in the quarter as you know we sell into emea through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors our emea direct markets accounted for 68 of the region sales during the third quarter of this year in u s dollars sales in our direct markets were 30 1 million up nearly 16 compared to last year primarily due to strong sales of wd 40 multi use product this increase in sales was primarily due to higher levels of promotional activities and increased distribution of our wd 40 ez reach flexible straw product in addition sales in the uk direct markets increased significantly due to higher sales of 1001 carpet fresh as the result of favorable impacts from digital marketing windfalls associated with the brand net sales in our emea distributor markets which accounted for 32 of the region sales increased by 7 during the quarter to 14 4 million this increase was primarily due to the increased sales of wd 40 multi use product in eastern europe primarily russia due to the timing of customer orders and more stable economic conditions in the region the emea segment made up 39 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 8 and 10 annually now to asia consolidated net sales in asia pacific which includes australia china and other countries in the asian region increased to 16 5 million in the third quarter up 14 from last year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in asia pacific would have increased to 17 1 million in the third quarter up 18 from last year in australia net sales were 4 2 million in the third quarter down 11 compared to last year primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had a negative impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in australia were down 3 compared to the same quarter of last year primarily due to a lower level of promotional activities in our asia distributor markets net sales were 8 3 million for the quarter up 50 compared to last year this increase in sales was driven by success from promotional programs as well as the timing of customers orders it s worth noting that in the comparable period last year sales in asia distributor markets were negatively impacted due to the transitioning of distributor partners in some of the region that transition has been completed for quite some time but due to the disruption last year the comparable period looks particularly strong year over year our asia distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell in u s dollars in that region in china net sales in u s dollars decreased to 3 9 million in the third quarter down 6 compared to last year primarily due to unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales would have remained constant year to date net sales in china increased 11 8 million up 6 compared to last year we remain optimistic about the long term opportunities in china although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities the asia pacific region made up 14 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 10 and 12 annually that wraps up my part of the report for today now over to jay who ll continue with the review of the financials jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks garry let s first start with the discussion about our 55 30 25 business model the long term targets that we use to guide our business as you may recall the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55 of net sales the 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization our goal is to drive our cost of doing business toward 30 of net sales over time and finally the 25 represents our target for ebitda well first the 55 are our gross margin in the third quarter our gross margin was 54 5 compared to 54 8 last year this represents a decrease of 30 basis points year over year sales of exchanges and other miscellaneous costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 160 basis points this period this is driven by a combination of unfavorable mix changes and increases in miscellaneous costs primarily in our americas and emea segments also negatively impacting gross margin by 50 basis points this quarter were changes in major input costs approximately 20 basis points came from increased cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals while the remaining 30 basis points came from higher cost associated with aerosol cans when we last updated investors we shared that we anticipated gross margin would begin to show a slight positive trend driven by the lower petroleum based input costs while we ve seen this in the americas the cost increases we experienced in emea and asia pacific more than offset these savings even though the cost of crude oil was lower the cost in emea and asia pacific for some of the petroleum based specialty chemicals we procure have increased as a result the average cost of raw materials has flowed through our cost of goods in the third quarter was higher this year and this has put pressure on our gross margin these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were mostly offset by the effect of sales price increases which we ve implemented in all three trading blocks over the last 12 months and positively impacted gross margin by 120 basis points in the third quarter also positively impacting margin in the third quarter by 30 basis points were lower manufacturing warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily in asia pacific we ve made some changes to our supply chain for our asia pacific distributor markets in late fiscal year 2018 and we re now beginning to see some of the benefits from these changes gross margin also positively impacted by lower advertising promotional and other discounts which we give to our customers and positively impacted gross margin results by 20 basis points and finally changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our emea segment positively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points as a reminder our long term gross margin target of 55 is not contingent upon commodity prices staying at any particular price point cannot control global market dynamics but we can continue to be deliberate and focused in managing our business so that we can maintain gross margin at or above our target of 55 over the long term now i ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business in the third quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 33 up 10 basis points from the third quarter last year for the third quarter 75 of our cost of doing business came from three areas people costs or the investments we make in our tribe the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales or a p investment was 5 5 in the third quarter and then finally freight the cost to get our products to our customers while our objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30 of net sales we ll continue to make necessary investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence and this brings us to ebitda the last of our 55 30 25 measures ebitda was 22 of net sales for the third quarter and down from the 23 last year and that completes the discussion on our 55 30 25 business model now let s discuss some items that fall below the line the provision for income taxes was 19 8 in the third quarter of this year compared to 24 3 last year the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the continued impact from the u s tax act and its effect on the company s fiscal year tax rate we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19 to 20 for the full fiscal year 2019 a little bit lower than we had previously anticipated and net income for the third quarter was 18 1 million versus 16 1 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 12 this resulted in diluted earnings per share of 1 30 for the third quarter compared to 1 15 for the same period last year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13 8 million shares from 13 9 million shares a year ago now a word about capital allocation our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long term growth while providing strong returns to our shareholders we continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases on june 18th 2019 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 61 per share payable july 31st to shareholders of record at the close of business on july 19th based on today s closing price of 161 35 the annualized dividend yield is 1 5 during the third quarter we repurchased approximately 62 000 shares of our stock at a total cost of 10 3 million under our current 75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the board in june 2018 at the end of our third fiscal quarter we had 52 6 million remaining under the plan as a reminder we target our maintenance capex of between 1 and 2 of net sales each year however this fiscal year we re making some additional investments that are expected to bring our total capital expenditures to around 22 million this investment is to support the renovation of our new facility in milton keynes and to procure some new production machinery as we ve previously disclosed so with that let s turn to fiscal year 2019 guidance as i mentioned we expect the provision for income tax to be a little bit lower than we previously anticipated due to the continued favorable impact from the u s tax cuts and jobs act as a result of a lower tax rate we are strengthening our net income and eps guidance for the full year we continue to expect net sales growth to be between 4 and 7 with net sales between 425 million and 437 million gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 55 advertising and promotion investment is projected to be between 5 5 and 6 of net sales the provision for income tax is expected to be between 19 and 20 with net income projected to be between 63 3 million and 64 4 million diluted earnings per share is expected to be between 4 58 and 4 65 based on an estimated 13 8 million weighted average shares outstanding i d like to remind investors that we continue to believe that net sales may come in at the lower end of the range that we ve shared with you today due to the impacts of fluctuating currency exchange rates in addition this guide does not include any expectations regarding future acquisitions or divestitures and that completes the financial overview and i ll turn it now back to garry garry o ridge chief executive officer hey thanks jay in summary what did you hear from us on the call today you heard that both our sales and earnings for the third quarter reflect new records for the company you heard that global sales of wd 40 multi use product were up 7 in the third quarter you heard that global sales of wd 40 specialist grew 8 in the third quarter you heard that we continue to increase penetration of smart straw and distribution of the wd 40 ez reach flexible you heard that linda lang has announced her retirement from our board of directors and that i expect to be stepping into her board chair position beginning in december you heard that we ve promoted steve brass to the role of president and chief operating officer and patricia olsem to the role of division president americas you heard that our net sales guidance remains unchanged but we have strengthened our guidance for net income and eps in closing i d like to share with you a quote today from anne mulcahy one of the things we often miss in succession planning is that it should be gradual and thoughtful with lots of sharing of information and knowledge and perspective so it s almost a nonevent when it happens thank you for joining us today and we d be pleased to open the conference call to your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from linda bolton weiser with d a davidson your line is open cindy ding d a davidson analyst hi this is cindy ding on for linda thanks for taking our questions so first did you see any shelf space changes at any retailer garry o ridge chief executive officer shelf space changes well no cindy ding d a davidson analyst okay garry o ridge chief executive officer no there was no change in our shelf distribution cindy ding d a davidson analyst okay thank you and then now that the gross margin is at around the 55 targeted level do you see potentials to get to a higher level going forward garry o ridge chief executive officer yeah as we ve always said we believe we do have upside on our gross margin and it will continue to be impacted as we roll out our premiumization strategy with things like smart straw the next generation of smart straw ez reach and as our specialist product range grows as a percentage of our overall revenue cindy ding d a davidson analyst great and as a follow up to that question are there any updates you can provide on the new smart straw system and when should we expect to learn about pricing and margin details garry o ridge chief executive officer the commercialization plan is currently being reviewed we expect that we would start seeing some of the next generation of smart straw into the market as we predicted sometime around the middle of next year and we ll keep you updated as we get closer cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you is the next calendar year garry o ridge chief executive officer yes cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you and then what are some initiatives to get the cost of doing business to 30 of sales garry o ridge chief executive officer the biggest driver for cost of business was increase of revenue we ve often said that it s really about getting leverage out of the infrastructure we have so as our revenue grows then you will see that that will have an impact on the cost of doing business ratio cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you that s all of our questions garry o ridge chief executive officer thank you very much operator your next question is from daniel rizzo with jefferies your line is open daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hi just to follow up on i think what you was talking about last call you mentioned that rotation at the warehouse was a headwind in the u s i think it was just some product rotation and i think that was being referred to in terms of shelf space is that still an issue now or that kind of ended garry o ridge chief executive officer in most cases we are through the impacts that we had around pricing but we continue to have opportunities to increase distribution across the club channel and through that first round we haven t lost any further distribution so again we would expect we ll rotate in as we were rotated out sometime in the future daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay and then i think you mentioned that that sales were strong in asia china was flat and australia was down a little bit i was just wondering what region you were seeing kind of the strength then i mean what specific country or area garry o ridge chief executive officer the biggest gain in the asia pacific region was through our distributor markets those are countries like malaysia singapore indonesia taiwan korea japan there s a few others but all of our distributor markets and this time last year we had a we had a period of time where we were changing our distributors in malaysia singapore and indonesia so that had a negative impact that s why there was such a large increase in the in the distributor markets australia primarily is due to currency we would expect that to australia to end up in growth in the year end we have no and as far as china is concerned we re very comfortable that we continue to grow at a reasonable rate in china as we build out the business to our long term plans daniel rizzo jefferies analyst is china more of a direct market at this point jay rembolt chief financial officer china is a direct market has been for 12 years daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay all right thank you for clarification and then finally just you mentioned tough comps in canada and i think latin america because of pre buying last year led to a big spike in the second quarter i m sorry in the third fiscal quarter i was wondering why that wasn t the case in the u s or was it and you just kind of overcame that jay rembolt chief financial officer correct it was and we overcame it in the u s i think i mentioned in the call that the results were particularly pleasing in the u s because we did have some buy up against price rise last year but our programs this year enabled us to come back and beat that in this fiscal year daniel rizzo jefferies analyst thank you very much jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks daniel operator your next question is from rosemarie morbelli with g research your line is open rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good afternoon everyone and congratulations to all the promotions and for the succession plan garry o ridge chief executive officer thank you rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so i was wondering if you could give us a better feel for pricing versus volume and what do you expect going forward for the balance of the year garry o ridge chief executive officer most of the gains that you ll see in the balance of the year are volume pricing has already been factored into our trading so jay i think that would be about correct jay rembolt chief financial officer for the remainder of the year yes yeah we don t see any additional pricing increases rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and do you see your raw material costs continuing to come down any change on the cans for example in addition to the petroleum garry o ridge chief executive officer actually cans have gone up there s probably some residual impact of tariffs even though we buy our cans in the u s in places very close to where we sell our product there has been some increase in can costs and it s somewhat coincident with the timing of tariffs rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and what do you hear in terms of tariff anecdotally by your customers in the different regions is the outlook kind of improving or is it the positiveness that one may have had a year ago is really has moved all the way into the negative territory jay rembolt chief financial officer i wouldn t say things have moved into the negative i think there is a continuing uncertainty out there you ve got a number of things that are impacting us at the moment the uncertainties around brexit the uncertainties around trade talks so we can as most companies and most people deal with risks they have a real problem dealing with uncertainty so that seems to be some of the area but i wouldn t say it s gone to negative i d say it s moderate rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and then lastly if i may you are looking at revenues being closer to the lower end of your expectations and the eps now lower and is your previous high end so is the benefit solely from the lower tax rate or are there other factors in between that are going to allow you to have a higher margin for intended ph purposes in order to get to those numbers garry o ridge chief executive officer it all comes from the change in tax for the most part rosemarie morbelli g research analyst nothing else no other benefits anywhere else garry o ridge chief executive officer there could be but it s too soon to tell rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay thank you jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our allotted time for questions we thank you for your participation on today s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line duration 38 minutes call participants wendy kelley director of investor relations and corporate communications garry o ridge chief executive officer jay rembolt chief financial officer cindy ding d a davidson analyst daniel rizzo jefferies analyst rosemarie morbelli g research analyst more wdfc

concerns about trade policy and a weak global economy continue to weigh on the us economic outlook and the federal reserve stands ready to act as appropriate to sustain a decade long expansion fed chairman jerome powell said on july 10 in remarks that could bolster expectations of an interest rate cut later this month in prepared remarks to a congressional committee powell contrasted the fed s baseline outlook of continued us growth against a considerable set of risks including persistently weak inflation slower growth in other major economies and a downturn in business investment driven by uncertainty over just how long the trump administration s trade war with china and other countries will last and how intense it will become story continues below advertisement remove ad fed officials at their june policy meeting signaled those concerns might warrant lower rates and since then based on incoming data and other developments it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the us outlook powell said apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty and our contacts in business and agriculture reported heightened concerns over trade developments powell said noting that business investment an important component of economic growth seems to have slowed notably in recent months overall growth has also moderated the fed chief said while there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate and not prove as transitory as fed officials have often insisted story continues below advertisement remove ad us stock index futures gained turning positive for the day after powell s remarks were released while the us dollar fell against a basket of other currencies government bond yields dipped with two year treasuries falling below 1 87 from around 1 93 earlier wednesday morning powell will present his remarks and take questions from members of the us house of representatives financial services committee beginning at 10 a m edt 1400 gmt and will testify again on thursday before the senate banking committee his appearances come at a particularly sensitive time for both the fed and powell personally with president donald trump lashing out at his handpicked fed chief for not cutting interest rates that in trump s view are needlessly slowing the economy story continues below advertisement remove ad at the same time in the view of fed officials trump s own policies including higher tariffs and a somewhat unpredictable approach have increased economic risks and led them to consider the very rate reductions trump has demanded the fed has kept its current benchmark overnight interest rate in a range of between 2 25 and 2 50 since december since a series of trump trade tweets in late may both investors and the fed have begun shifting their stance with markets now expecting a cut of at least a quarter of a percentage point when fed policymakers meet at the end of the month the us economy did not change much in the days that followed trump s may 30 comments on twitter threatening to impose tariffs on mexico unless the country met his demands for tougher controls on immigrants crossing its northern border but trump s statements spooked financial markets so decisively and the threats to the global economy became so palpable that a rate cut of at least 25 basis points now appears a near certainty with a 50 basis point cut also considered possible as extra protection the fed has never disappointed a market with such strong expectations of action joseph lavorgna chief economist for the americas at natixis wrote in a recent analysis with investors in contracts linked to the fed s targeted overnight lending rate putting the probability of a rate reduction at close to 100 percent it would be unprecedented for the fed to not cut lavorgna wrote following the hearing on wednesday the fed is due to release the minutes from its last policy meeting which should show the extent to which the thinking at the central bank shifted in the days following trump s mexico tariff threat and how the discussion was shaped by other concerns including weak inflation though us economic growth remains largely on track and the jobs report for june showed continued strong hiring the events of may changed us trade policy from something of a sideshow in the fed s view to a central concern earlier rounds of us tariffs on trading partners including china had been dismissed as of little macroeconomic importance with the fed in early may still anticipating its policy rate would remain unchanged for the rest of the year by contrast the higher tariffs announced against china in early may a rising sense the world s two largest economies might not be able to make a deal and the tariff threat against mexico all added to the growing feeling that protectionism and higher tariffs were here to stay at some cost to investment and growth tariff threats the case for lowering borrowing costs isn t fully decided reducing rates at this point would be similar to the fed s efforts in the mid 1990s to nurse along a lengthy recovery rather than respond to a looming downturn and there s no immediate need to move philadelphia fed president patrick harker said on tuesday but trump s tweets about mexico had a particularly unsettling impact touching off enough volatility and doubt about the future that it pushed the fed towards the very rate cuts trump has demanded for other reasons as trump tied the threatened tariffs which would have hit one of the world s most integrated supply chains to non economic demands about immigration investors over two days knocked about a quarter of a percentage point from the federal funds rate expected at the end of 2019 that added a full additional rate cut to the one investors already had expected and added market pressure to the fed s growing list of concerns at the fed s last policy meeting in mid june eight of the 17 policymakers saw the need for at least one rate cut by year s end and powell told reporters afterwards that many others were leaning in that direction the minutes due out at 2 p m 1800 gmt may show how strong that sentiment has become in the fed s monetary policy report issued last week ahead of powell s testimony the trade war received its own analysis a sign of the attention it is getting within the central bank fed staff concluded the rise in world tariffs had a likely material impact on the slowdown in global trade last year and that uncertainty surrounding trade policy could be leading firms to delay investment decisions and reduce capital expenditures though the threatened tariffs on mexico never materialized and china and the united states have agreed to resume talks to reach a trade deal that did little to alleviate the uncertainty that fed officials believe is contributing to cooling

tangier overlooks a sea of opportunities with the launch of the mediterranean s largest port just 14 km away from the eu says eli hadzhieva founder and director of dialogue for europe there is more to tangier than its sheltering sky and its artsy cafes which were the favourite hangouts of literary giants and celebrities such as paul powles jack kerouac and alan ginsberg when the north african city had an international status from 1924 to 1956 tangier evolved from being a melting pot of arabs berbers jews spaniards italians belgians dutch french english americans to an international trade and logistics hub at present day high speed trains connect the city to rabat and casablanca and other cities along a 1300km railway network whereas modern highways as part of a 1800km highway system link it to the rest of the country related content part of these big infrastructure projects and strategic investments have been supported by the european investment bank which shows the eagerness of the eu to enhance competitiveness and connectivity in morocco so was the extension of the tanger med port which hosts a state of art facility special economic zone only 35 km from the city of tangier offering fiscal administrative and customs advantages i e temporary admission of raw material and less paper work for investors following the inauguration of a second port facility tanger med 2 on june 28th this year the container capacity of the port is expected to increase to 9 million twenty foot equivalent unit teu making it the biggest port in africa and on the mediterranean sea as envisioned by the moroccan king mohammed vi the port is strategically situated on the strait of gibraltar where the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean meet and european and african continents

only spain s algeciras is 14 km away from tanger med but the port finds itself in the centre of global maritime routes permitting for close to zero deviation for ships at a crossing point for 20

setting it up certainly for a july rate cut jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset capital management in chicago told the reuters news agency to me it all depends on where you look in the

number one responsibility of our tribal leaders is to share knowledge and inspire ongoing learning with that end in mind we recently refreshed our internal learning program and renamed it learning laboratory which is our global ecosystem for tribal learning and development through the lab we create and deliver learning and encompass skills sales skills technical product knowledge leadership and general competencies we strongly believe in strengthening our tribe from within because building a strong bench of great talent and future leaders is critical to our continued success we are fortunate to have a tremendous depth of talent throughout all ranks of the company and a strong succession plan in place to further ensure the continuation of culture and the success of our company we announced last month that steve brass has been appointed to the role of president and chief operating officer of the company and patricia olsem has been promoted to the role of division president americas in conjunction with steve s appointment i will no longer serve as president but i ll continue to serve as the chief executive officer of the company in addition to these management changes we shared with investors that linda lang will retire as a director and as chair of the company s board at the next annual general meeting in december 2019 and at that time the board intends to appoint me as board chair i m very excited about taking on this latest responsibility and for the opportunity to mentor the future leaders of this great organization strategic initiative number 5 operational excellence inaudible this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at wd 40 company make it better than it is today we are continuously focused on optimizing resources systems and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance regulatory compliance intellectual property protection recently we held two global summits one in san diego and one in our brand new technology center in pine brook new jersey in san diego members of our global quality tribe gathered together to gain an alignment on topics related to quality insurance innovation and regulatory compliance in pine brook our scientists human resource and supply chain tribe members gathered together with some of our key suppliers to collaborate and gain alignment on some of our global opportunities and challenges that our tribe is facing these summits are a living breathing example of our tribe consistently striving to make it better than it is today that completes the update on the strategic initiatives so let s move on to the details of our third quarter results starting with sales as i mentioned earlier consolidated net sales were 114 million in the third quarter up 7 year over year which reflects a new record for the company translation of foreign currency subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the u s dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales in the third quarter on a constant currency basis net sales would have been 117 5 million in the third quarter up 10 compared to the last year and resulting in a diluted earnings per share of 1 35 before i discuss what s happening in the individual segments i d like to take a moment to remind investors that though we do not consider our business to be a seasonal one it s common for our sales results to fluctuate from one period to another due to various factors including the level of promotional activities specific programs being run at customer locations the timing of customer orders or the impact of new product launches this is all a normal part of our business and we are accustomed to these types of fluctuations and manage them as part of our normal business activities just when something out of the ordinary happens that we will discuss the event in much greater detail here with investors so now let s start with the americas net sales in the americas which includes the united states latin america and canada remain constant at 53 million in the third quarter compared to last year year to date net sales in the americas were also relatively flat compared to last year sales of maintenance products increased 1 with 369 000 in the americas entirely due to the higher sales of maintenance products in the united states the increase in sales in the united states was nearly all offset by lower sales of maintenance products in canada and latin america maintenance products sales in the united states increased 6 in the third quarter primarily due to increased sales of the wd 40 specialist sales of wd 40 specialist were up 30 in the u s due to new distribution and successful promotional activities sales of wd 40 multi use product in the u s were up 3 compared to last year due to the successful promotional programs being run this increase in sales in the u s was quite an achievement considering that the third quarter of last year many of our customers were buying products in advance of our planned price increases the increase in maintenance product sales in the u s were significantly offset by decreases in sales in both canada and latin america year over year sales in canada were down 18 and sales in latin america down 16 this is because we were up against tough comparable periods both in canada and latin america as customers in the prior year bought high volumes of product in advance of our planned price increases as a reminder our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the americas decreased 8 in the third quarter compared to the prior year largely due to the lower sales of 2000 flushes and spot shot which declined 6 and 10 respectively we continue to consider homecare and cleaning products except for those listed as 2025 brands as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows but i generally expect it to become a smaller part of the business over time in total the america segment made up 47 of our global business and over the long term we anticipate sales within this segment will grow between 2 and 5 annually now on to emea net sales in emea which includes europe the middle east africa and india increased to 44 5 million in the third quarter up 13 from last year year to date net sales in emea were up 9 compared to last year emea s reported results in the third quarter were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales in emea would have increased to 47 3 million in the third quarter up 20 from last year translation related impacts were immaterial in the quarter as you know we sell into emea through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors our emea direct markets accounted for 68 of the region sales during the third quarter of this year in u s dollars sales in our direct markets were 30 1 million up nearly 16 compared to last year primarily due to strong sales of wd 40 multi use product this increase in sales was primarily due to higher levels of promotional activities and increased distribution of our wd 40 ez reach flexible straw product in addition sales in the uk direct markets increased significantly due to higher sales of 1001 carpet fresh as the result of favorable impacts from digital marketing windfalls associated with the brand net sales in our emea distributor markets which accounted for 32 of the region sales increased by 7 during the quarter to 14 4 million this increase was primarily due to the increased sales of wd 40 multi use product in eastern europe primarily russia due to the timing of customer orders and more stable economic conditions in the region the emea segment made up 39 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 8 and 10 annually now to asia consolidated net sales in asia pacific which includes australia china and other countries in the asian region increased to 16 5 million in the third quarter up 14 from last year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in asia pacific would have increased to 17 1 million in the third quarter up 18 from last year in australia net sales were 4 2 million in the third quarter down 11 compared to last year primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had a negative impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in australia were down 3 compared to the same quarter of last year primarily due to a lower level of promotional activities in our asia distributor markets net sales were 8 3 million for the quarter up 50 compared to last year this increase in sales was driven by success from promotional programs as well as the timing of customers orders it s worth noting that in the comparable period last year sales in asia distributor markets were negatively impacted due to the transitioning of distributor partners in some of the region that transition has been completed for quite some time but due to the disruption last year the comparable period looks particularly strong year over year our asia distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell in u s dollars in that region in china net sales in u s dollars decreased to 3 9 million in the third quarter down 6 compared to last year primarily due to unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales would have remained constant year to date net sales in china increased 11 8 million up 6 compared to last year we remain optimistic about the long term opportunities in china although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities the asia pacific region made up 14 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 10 and 12 annually that wraps up my part of the report for today now over to jay who ll continue with the review of the financials jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks garry let s first start with the discussion about our 55 30 25 business model the long term targets that we use to guide our business as you may recall the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55 of net sales the 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization our goal is to drive our cost of doing business toward 30 of net sales over time and finally the 25 represents our target for ebitda well first the 55 are our gross margin in the third quarter our gross margin was 54 5 compared to 54 8 last year this represents a decrease of 30 basis points year over year sales of exchanges and other miscellaneous costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 160 basis points this period this is driven by a combination of unfavorable mix changes and increases in miscellaneous costs primarily in our americas and emea segments also negatively impacting gross margin by 50 basis points this quarter were changes in major input costs approximately 20 basis points came from increased cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals while the remaining 30 basis points came from higher cost associated with aerosol cans when we last updated investors we shared that we anticipated gross margin would begin to show a slight positive trend driven by the lower petroleum based input costs while we ve seen this in the americas the cost increases we experienced in emea and asia pacific more than offset these savings even though the cost of crude oil was lower the cost in emea and asia pacific for some of the petroleum based specialty chemicals we procure have increased as a result the average cost of raw materials has flowed through our cost of goods in the third quarter was higher this year and this has put pressure on our gross margin these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were mostly offset by the effect of sales price increases which we ve implemented in all three trading blocks over the last 12 months and positively impacted gross margin by 120 basis points in the third quarter also positively impacting margin in the third quarter by 30 basis points were lower manufacturing warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily in asia pacific we ve made some changes to our supply chain for our asia pacific distributor markets in late fiscal year 2018 and we re now beginning to see some of the benefits from these changes gross margin also positively impacted by lower advertising promotional and other discounts which we give to our customers and positively impacted gross margin results by 20 basis points and finally changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our emea segment positively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points as a reminder our long term gross margin target of 55 is not contingent upon commodity prices staying at any particular price point cannot control global market dynamics but we can continue to be deliberate and focused in managing our business so that we can maintain gross margin at or above our target of 55 over the long term now i ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business in the third quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 33 up 10 basis points from the third quarter last year for the third quarter 75 of our cost of doing business came from three areas people costs or the investments we make in our tribe the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales or a p investment was 5 5 in the third quarter and then finally freight the cost to get our products to our customers while our objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30 of net sales we ll continue to make necessary investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence and this brings us to ebitda the last of our 55 30 25 measures ebitda was 22 of net sales for the third quarter and down from the 23 last year and that completes the discussion on our 55 30 25 business model now let s discuss some items that fall below the line the provision for income taxes was 19 8 in the third quarter of this year compared to 24 3 last year the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the continued impact from the u s tax act and its effect on the company s fiscal year tax rate we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19 to 20 for the full fiscal year 2019 a little bit lower than we had previously anticipated and net income for the third quarter was 18 1 million versus 16 1 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 12 this resulted in diluted earnings per share of 1 30 for the third quarter compared to 1 15 for the same period last year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13 8 million shares from 13 9 million shares a year ago now a word about capital allocation our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long term growth while providing strong returns to our shareholders we continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases on june 18th 2019 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 61 per share payable july 31st to shareholders of record at the close of business on july 19th based on today s closing price of 161 35 the annualized dividend yield is 1 5 during the third quarter we repurchased approximately 62 000 shares of our stock at a total cost of 10 3 million under our current 75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the board in june 2018 at the end of our third fiscal quarter we had 52 6 million remaining under the plan as a reminder we target our maintenance capex of between 1 and 2 of net sales each year however this fiscal year we re making some additional investments that are expected to bring our total capital expenditures to around 22 million this investment is to support the renovation of our new facility in milton keynes and to procure some new production machinery as we ve previously disclosed so with that let s turn to fiscal year 2019 guidance as i mentioned we expect the provision for income tax to be a little bit lower than we previously anticipated due to the continued favorable impact from the u s tax cuts and jobs act as a result of a lower tax rate we are strengthening our net income and eps guidance for the full year we continue to expect net sales growth to be between 4 and 7 with net sales between 425 million and 437 million gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 55 advertising and promotion investment is projected to be between 5 5 and 6 of net sales the provision for income tax is expected to be between 19 and 20 with net income projected to be between 63 3 million and 64 4 million diluted earnings per share is expected to be between 4 58 and 4 65 based on an estimated 13 8 million weighted average shares outstanding i d like to remind investors that we continue to believe that net sales may come in at the lower end of the range that we ve shared with you today due to the impacts of fluctuating currency exchange rates in addition this guide does not include any expectations regarding future acquisitions or divestitures and that completes the financial overview and i ll turn it now back to garry garry o ridge chief executive officer hey thanks jay in summary what did you hear from us on the call today you heard that both our sales and earnings for the third quarter reflect new records for the company you heard that global sales of wd 40 multi use product were up 7 in the third quarter you heard that global sales of wd 40 specialist grew 8 in the third quarter you heard that we continue to increase penetration of smart straw and distribution of the wd 40 ez reach flexible you heard that linda lang has announced her retirement from our board of directors and that i expect to be stepping into her board chair position beginning in december you heard that we ve promoted steve brass to the role of president and chief operating officer and patricia olsem to the role of division president americas you heard that our net sales guidance remains unchanged but we have strengthened our guidance for net income and eps in closing i d like to share with you a quote today from anne mulcahy one of the things we often miss in succession planning is that it should be gradual and thoughtful with lots of sharing of information and knowledge and perspective so it s almost a nonevent when it happens thank you for joining us today and we d be pleased to open the conference call to your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from linda bolton weiser with d a davidson your line is open cindy ding d a davidson analyst hi this is cindy ding on for linda thanks for taking our questions so first did you see any shelf space changes at any retailer garry o ridge chief executive officer shelf space changes well no cindy ding d a davidson analyst okay garry o ridge chief executive officer no there was no change in our shelf distribution cindy ding d a davidson analyst okay thank you and then now that the gross margin is at around the 55 targeted level do you see potentials to get to a higher level going forward garry o ridge chief executive officer yeah as we ve always said we believe we do have upside on our gross margin and it will continue to be impacted as we roll out our premiumization strategy with things like smart straw the next generation of smart straw ez reach and as our specialist product range grows as a percentage of our overall revenue cindy ding d a davidson analyst great and as a follow up to that question are there any updates you can provide on the new smart straw system and when should we expect to learn about pricing and margin details garry o ridge chief executive officer the commercialization plan is currently being reviewed we expect that we would start seeing some of the next generation of smart straw into the market as we predicted sometime around the middle of next year and we ll keep you updated as we get closer cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you is the next calendar year garry o ridge chief executive officer yes cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you and then what are some initiatives to get the cost of doing business to 30 of sales garry o ridge chief executive officer the biggest driver for cost of business was increase of revenue we ve often said that it s really about getting leverage out of the infrastructure we have so as our revenue grows then you will see that that will have an impact on the cost of doing business ratio cindy ding d a davidson analyst thank you that s all of our questions garry o ridge chief executive officer thank you very much operator your next question is from daniel rizzo with jefferies your line is open daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hi just to follow up on i think what you was talking about last call you mentioned that rotation at the warehouse was a headwind in the u s i think it was just some product rotation and i think that was being referred to in terms of shelf space is that still an issue now or that kind of ended garry o ridge chief executive officer in most cases we are through the impacts that we had around pricing but we continue to have opportunities to increase distribution across the club channel and through that first round we haven t lost any further distribution so again we would expect we ll rotate in as we were rotated out sometime in the future daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay and then i think you mentioned that that sales were strong in asia china was flat and australia was down a little bit i was just wondering what region you were seeing kind of the strength then i mean what specific country or area garry o ridge chief executive officer the biggest gain in the asia pacific region was through our distributor markets those are countries like malaysia singapore indonesia taiwan korea japan there s a few others but all of our distributor markets and this time last year we had a we had a period of time where we were changing our distributors in malaysia singapore and indonesia so that had a negative impact that s why there was such a large increase in the in the distributor markets australia primarily is due to currency we would expect that to australia to end up in growth in the year end we have no and as far as china is concerned we re very comfortable that we continue to grow at a reasonable rate in china as we build out the business to our long term plans daniel rizzo jefferies analyst is china more of a direct market at this point jay rembolt chief financial officer china is a direct market has been for 12 years daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay all right thank you for clarification and then finally just you mentioned tough comps in canada and i think latin america because of pre buying last year led to a big spike in the second quarter i m sorry in the third fiscal quarter i was wondering why that wasn t the case in the u s or was it and you just kind of overcame that jay rembolt chief financial officer correct it was and we overcame it in the u s i think i mentioned in the call that the results were particularly pleasing in the u s because we did have some buy up against price rise last year but our programs this year enabled us to come back and beat that in this fiscal year daniel rizzo jefferies analyst thank you very much jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks daniel operator your next question is from rosemarie morbelli with g research your line is open rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you good afternoon everyone and congratulations to all the promotions and for the succession plan garry o ridge chief executive officer thank you rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so i was wondering if you could give us a better feel for pricing versus volume and what do you expect going forward for the balance of the year garry o ridge chief executive officer most of the gains that you ll see in the balance of the year are volume pricing has already been factored into our trading so jay i think that would be about correct jay rembolt chief financial officer for the remainder of the year yes yeah we don t see any additional pricing increases rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and do you see your raw material costs continuing to come down any change on the cans for example in addition to the petroleum garry o ridge chief executive officer actually cans have gone up there s probably some residual impact of tariffs even though we buy our cans in the u s in places very close to where we sell our product there has been some increase in can costs and it s somewhat coincident with the timing of tariffs rosemarie morbelli g research analyst and what do you hear in terms of tariff anecdotally by your customers in the different regions is the outlook kind of improving or is it the positiveness that one may have had a year ago is really has moved all the way into the negative territory jay rembolt chief financial officer i wouldn t say things have moved into the negative i think there is a continuing uncertainty out there you ve got a number of things that are impacting us at the moment the uncertainties around brexit the uncertainties around trade talks so we can as most companies and most people deal with risks they have a real problem dealing with uncertainty so that seems to be some of the area but i wouldn t say it s gone to negative i d say it s moderate rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and then lastly if i may you are looking at revenues being closer to the lower end of your expectations and the eps now lower and is your previous high end so is the benefit solely from the lower tax rate or are there other factors in between that are going to allow you to have a higher margin for intended ph purposes in order to get to those numbers garry o ridge chief executive officer it all comes from the change in tax for the most part rosemarie morbelli g research analyst nothing else no other benefits anywhere else garry o ridge chief executive officer there could be but it s too soon to tell rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay thank you jay rembolt chief financial officer thanks operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our allotted time for questions we thank you for your participation on today s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line duration 38 minutes call participants wendy kelley director of investor relations and corporate communications garry o ridge chief executive officer jay rembolt chief financial officer cindy ding d a davidson analyst daniel rizzo jefferies analyst rosemarie morbelli g research analyst more wdfc

from the withdrawal of american tariffs on steel and aluminum and optimism surrounding the passage of the renegotiated north american free trade agreement this uncertainty means canadian exports will

opportunities for wd 40 specialist however there may be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution and the various other factors that come along with building out a new product line year to date net sales of products included under this initiative were up 10 compared to last year strategic initiative number three is to broaden product and revenue base strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products like 3 in one wd 40 bike and gt 85 but also includes such brands as spot shot and lava in the americas 1001 in emea and no vac and solvol in asia pacific we believe we are on track to reach a combined revenue for these products of approximately 70 million by 2025 global sales of products included under this initiative were 14 2 million in the third quarter compared to 13 7 million in the third quarter of last year reflecting an increase of 4 period over period year to date net sales of products under this initiative were up 3 compared to last year nearly all of the growth is attributable to the strong sales of 1001 carpet fresh in the uk due to the favorable impacts of some digital marketing windfalls associated with the brand strategic initiative number four is to attract develop and retain outstanding tribe members our goal under this initiative is to attract develop and retain talented tribe members and to grow tribe member engagement to greater than 95 the number one responsibility of our tribal leaders is to share knowledge and inspire ongoing learning with that aim in mind we recently refreshed our internal learning program and renamed it learning laboratory which is our global ecosystem for tribal learning and development through the lab we create and deliver learning and encompass skills sales skills technical product knowledge leadership and general competencies we strongly believe in strengthening our tribe from within because building a strong bench of great talent and future leaders is critical to our continued success we are fortunate to have a tremendous depth of talent throughout all ranks of the company and a strong succession plan in place to further ensure the continuation of culture and the success of our company we announced last month that steve brass has been appointed to the role of president and chief operating officer of the company and patricia olsem has been promoted to the role of division president of americas in conjunction with steveâ s appointment i will no longer serve as president but will continue to serve as the chief executive officer of the company in addition to these management changes we shared with investors that linda lang will retire as a director and as chair of the companyâ s board at our next annual general meeting in december 2019 and at that time the board intends to appoint me as board chair iâ m very excited about taking on this latest responsibility and for the opportunity to mentor the future leaders of this great organization strategic initiative number five operational excellence evolving this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at wd 40 company make it better than it is today we are continuously focused on optimizing resources systems and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance regulatory compliance intellectual property protection recently we held two global summits one in our san diego and one in our brand new technology center in pine brook new jersey in san diego members of our global quality tribe gathered together to gain alignment on topics related to quality insurance innovation and regulatory compliance in pine brook our scientists human resources and supply chain tribe members gathered together with some of our key suppliers to collaborate and gain alignment on some of our global opportunities and challenges our tribe is facing these summits are a living breathing example of a tribe consistently striving to make it better than it is today that completes the update on the strategic initiatives so letâ s move on to the details of our third quarter results starting with sales as i mentioned earlier consolidated net sales were 114 million in the third quarter up 7 year over year which reflects a new record for the company translation of foreign currency subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the u s dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales in the third quarter on a constant currency basis net sales would have been 117 5 million in the third quarter up 10 compared to the last year and resulting in a diluted earnings per share of 1 35 before i discuss whatâ s happening in the individual segments iâ d like to take a moment to remind investors that though we do not consider our business to be a seasonal one itâ s common for our sales results to fluctuate from one period to another due to various factors including the level of promotional activities specific programs being run at customer locations the timing of customer orders or the impact of new product launches this is all a normal part of our business and we are accustomed to these types of fluctuations and manage them as part of our normal business activities it is when something out of the ordinary happens that we will discuss the event in much greater detail here with investors so now letâ s start with the americas net sales in the americas which includes united states latin america and canada remained constant at 53 million in the third quarter compared to last year year to date net sales in the americas were also relatively flat compared to last year sales of maintenance products increased 1 or 369 000 in the americas entirely due to the higher sales of maintenance products in the united states the increase in sales in the united states was nearly all offset by lower sales in maintenance products in canada and latin america maintenance product sales in the united states increased 6 in the third quarter primarily due to increased sales of wd 40 specialist sales of wd 40 specialist were up 30 in the u s due to new distribution and successful promotional activities sales of wd 40 multi use product in the u s were up 3 compared to last year due to the successful promotional programs being run this increase in sales in the u s was quite an achievement considering that in the third quarter last year many of our customers were buying products in advance of our planned price increases the increase in maintenance product sales in the u s was significantly offset by decreases in sales in both canada and latin america year over year sales in canada were down 18 and sales in latin america down 16 this is because weâ re up against tough comparable period both in canada and latin america as customers in the prior year bought high volumes of product in advance of our planned price increases as a reminder our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the americas decreased 8 in the third quarter compared to the prior year largely due to lower sales of 2000 flushes and spot shot which declined 6 and 10 respectively we continue to consider homecare and cleaning products except for those listed as 2025 brands as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions in cash flows that are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business over time in total the americas segment made up 47 of our global business and over the long term we anticipate sales within this segment will grow between 2 and 5 annually now onto emea net sales in emea which includes europe the middle east africa and india increased to 44 5 million in the third quarter up 13 from last year year to date net sales in emea were up 9 compared to last year emeaâ s reported results in the third quarter were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales in emea would have increased to 47 3 million in the third quarter up 20 from last year translation related impacts were immaterial in the quarter as you know we sell into emea through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors our emea direct markets accounted for 68 of the region sales during the third quarter of this year in u s dollar sales in our direct markets were 30 1 million up nearly 16 compared to last year primarily due to strong sales of wd 40 multi use product this increase in sales was primarily due to higher levels of promotional activities and increased distribution of our wd 40 ez reach flexible straw product in addition sales in the uk direct markets increased significantly due to higher sales of 1001 carpet fresh as a result of favorable impacts from digital marketing windfalls associated with the brand net sales in our emea distributor markets which accounted for 32 of the region sales increased by 7 during the quarter to 14 4 million this increase was primarily due to the increased sales of wd 40 multi use product in eastern europe primarily russia due to the timing of customer orders and more stable economic conditions in the region the emea segment made up 39 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 8 and 10 annually now to asia consolidated net sales in asia pacific which includes australia china and other countries in the asian region increased to 16 5 million in the third quarter up 14 from last year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in asia pacific would have increased to 17 1 million in the third quarter up 18 from last year in australia net sales were 4 2 million in the third quarter down 11 compared to last year primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had a negative impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in australia were down 3 compared to the same quarter of last year primarily due to lower level of promotional activities in our asia distributor markets net sales were 8 3 million for the quarter up 50 compared to last year this increase in sales was driven by successful promotional programs as well as the timing of customer orders itâ s worth noting that in the comparable period last year sales in asia distributor markets were negatively impacted due to the transitioning of distributor partners in some of the region that transition has been completed for quite some time but due to the disruption last year the comparable period looks particularly strong year over year our asia distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell in u s dollars in that region in china net sales in u s dollars decreased to 3 9 million in the third quarter down 6 compared to last year primarily due to unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales would have remained constant year to date net sales in china increased to 11 8 million up 6 compared to last year we remain optimistic about the long term opportunities in china although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution shifting of economic patterns and varying industrial activities the asia pacific region made up 14 of our global sales over the long term we expect sales within this segment will grow between 10 and 12 annually that wraps up my part of the report for today now over to jay who will continue with the review of the financials jay rembolt thanks garry letâ s first start with the discussion about our 55 30 25 business model the long term targets that we use to guide our business as you may recall the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55 of net sales the 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization our goal is to drive our cost of doing business toward 30 of net sales over time and finally the 25 represents our target for ebitda first the 55 or our gross margin in the third quarter our gross margin was 54 5 compared to 54 8 last year this represents a decrease of 30 basis points year over year the sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 160 basis points this period this is driven by a combination of unfavorable mix changes and increases in miscellaneous costs primarily in our americas and emea segments also negatively impacting gross margin by 50 basis points this quarter were changes in major input costs approximately 20 basis points came from increased cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals while remaining 30 basis points came from higher costs associated with aerosol cans when we last updated investors we shared that we anticipated gross margin would begin to show a slight positive trend driven by the lower petroleum based input costs while weâ ve seen this in the americas cost increases we experienced in emea and asia pacific more than offset these savings even though the cost of crude oil was lower the costs in emea and asia pacific for some of the petroleum based specialty chemicals we procure have increased as a result the average cost of raw materials that flow through our cost of goods in the third quarter was higher this year and this has put pressure on our gross margin these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were mostly offset by the effect of sales price increases which weâ ve implemented in all three trading blocks over the last 12 months and positively impacted gross margin by 120 basis points in the third quarter also positively impacting margin in the third quarter by 30 basis points were lower manufacturing warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily in asia pacific we made some changes to our supply chain for our asia pacific distributor markets in late fiscal year 2018 and we are now beginning to see some of the benefits from these changes gross margin also positively impacted by lower advertising promotional and other discounts which we give to our customers and positively impacted gross margin results by 20 basis points and finally changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our emea segment positively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points as a reminder our long term gross margin target of 55 is not contingent upon commodity prices staying at any particular price point we cannot control global market dynamics but we can continue to be deliberate and focused in managing our business so that we can maintain gross margin at or above our target of 55 over the long term now iâ ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business in the third quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 33 up10 basis points from the third quarter last year for the third quarter 75 of our cost of doing business came from three areas people costs or the investments we make in our tribe the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales our a p investment was 5 5 in the third quarter and then finally freight the cost to get our products to our customers our objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30 of net sales weâ ll continue to make necessary investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence and this brings us to ebitda the last of our 55 30 25 measures ebitda was 22 of net sales for the third quarter and down from the 23 last year and that completes the discussion on our 55 30 25 business model now letâ s discuss some items that fall below the line the provision for income taxes was 19 8 in the third quarter of this year compared to 24 3 last year the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the continued impact from the u s tax act and its effect on the companyâ s fiscal year tax rate we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19 to 20 for the full fiscal year 2019 a little bit lower than we had previously anticipated and net income for the third quarter was 18 1 million versus 16 1 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 12 this resulted in diluted earnings per share of 1 30 for the third quarter compared to 1 15 for the same period last year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13 8 million shares from 13 9 million shares a year ago now a word about capital allocation our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long term growth while providing strong returns to our shareholders we continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases on june 18 2019 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 61 per share payable july 31st to shareholders of record at the close of business on july 19th based on todayâ s closing price of 161 35 the annualized dividend yield is 1 5 during the third quarter we repurchased approximately 62 000 shares of our stock at a total cost of 10 3 million under our current 75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the board in june 2018 at the end of our third fiscal quarter we had 52 6 million remaining under the plan as a reminder we target our maintenance capex of between 1 and 2 of net sales each year however this fiscal year weâ re making some additional investments that are expected to bring our total capital expenditures to around 22 million this investment is to support the renovation of our new facility in milton keynes and to procure some new production machinery as we previously disclosed so with that letâ s turn to fiscal year 2019 guidance as i mentioned we expect the provision for income tax to be a little bit lower than we previously anticipated due to the continued favorable impacts from the u s tax cuts and jobs act as a result of lower tax rate we are strengthening our net income and eps guidance for the full year we continue to expect net sales growth to be between 4 and 7 with net sales between 425 million and 437 million gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 55 advertising and promotion investment is projected to be between 5 5 and 6 of net sales the provision for income tax is expected to be between 19 and 20 with net income projected to be between 63 3 million and 64 4 million diluted earnings per share is expected to be between 4 58 and 4 65 based on an estimated 13 8 million weighted average shares outstanding iâ d like to remind investors that we continue to believe that sales may be may come in at the lower end of the range that weâ ve shared with you today due to the impacts of fluctuating currency exchange rates in addition this guidance does not include any expectations regarding future acquisitions or divestitures and that completes the financial overview and iâ ll turn it now back to garry garry ridge hey thanks jay in summary what did you hear from us on the call today you heard that both our sales and earnings for the third quarter reflect new records for the company you heard that global sales of wd 40 multi use product were up 7 in the third quarter you heard that global sales of wd 40 specialist grew 8 in the third quarter you heard that we continue to increase penetration of smart straw and distribution of the wd 40 ez reach flexible you heard that linda lang has announced her retirement from our board of directors and that i expect to be stepping into her board chair position beginning in december you heard that weâ ve promoted steve brass to the role of president and chief operating officer and patricia olsem to the role of division president americas you heard that our net sales guidance remains unchanged but we have strengthened our guidance for net income and eps in closing iâ d like to share with you a quote today from anne mulcahy one of the things we often miss in succession planning is that it should be gradual and thoughtful with lots of sharing of information and knowledge and perspective so itâ s almost a non event when it happens thank you for joining us today and weâ d be pleased to open the conference call to your questions question and answer session your first question comes from linda bolton weiser with d a davidson your line is open cindy ding hi this is cindy ding on for linda thanks for taking our questions so first did you see any shelf space changes at any retailer garry ridge shelf space changes well no cindy ding okay garry ridge no there was no change in our shelf distribution cindy ding okay thank you and then now that the gross margin is at around the 55 targeted level do you see potential to get to a higher level going forward garry ridge yes as weâ ve always shared we believe we do have upside on our gross margin and it will continue to be impacted as we roll out our premiumization strategy with things like smart straw the next generation of smart straw ez reach and as our specialist product range grows as a percentage of our overall revenue cindy ding as a follow up to that question are there any updates you can provide on the new smart straw system and when should we expect to learn about pricing and margin details garry ridge the commercialization plan is currently being reviewed weâ d expect that we would start seeing some of the next generation of smart straw end of the market as we predicted sometime around the middle of next year and weâ ll keep you updated as we get closer cindy ding thank you is it the next calendar year garry ridge yes cindy ding thank you and then what are some initiatives to get the cost of doing business to 30 of sales garry ridge the biggest driver for the cost of business is increase of revenue weâ ve often said that itâ s really about getting leverage out of the infrastructure we have so as our revenue grows then you will see that that will have an impact on the cost of doing business ratio operator your next question is from daniel rizzo with jefferies your line is open daniel rizzo hi just to follow up on i think what she was talking about last call you mentioned that rotation at the warehouse was a headwind in the u s i think which is just some product rotation and i think thatâ s what is being referred to in terms of shelf space is that still an issue now or is that kind of ended garry ridge in most cases we are through the impacts that we had around pricing but we continue to have opportunities to increase distribution across the club channel and weâ re through that first round we havenâ t lost any further distribution so again we would expect weâ ll rotate in as we were rotated out sometime in the future daniel rizzo and then i think you mentioned that sales were strong in asia but china was flat and australia was down a little bit i was just wondering what region you were seeing kind of the strength then i mean whether it was a specific country or area garry ridge the biggest gain in the asia pacific region was through our distributor markets those are countries like malaysia singapore indonesia taiwan korea japan thereâ s a few others but all of our distributor markets and this time last year we had a period of time where we were changing our distributors in malaysia singapore and indonesia so that had a negative impact thatâ s why there was such a large increase in the distributor markets australia primarily is due to currency weâ d expect that to australia to end up in growth in the year end and we have no and as far as china is concerned weâ re very comfortable that we continue to grow at a reasonable rate in china as we build out the business to our long term plans daniel rizzo is china more of a direct market at this point garry ridge china is a direct market has been for 12 years daniel rizzo okay all right thank you for that clarification and then finally you mentioned tough comps in canada and i think latin america because of your prebuying last year led to a big spike in the second quarter iâ m sorry in the third fiscal quarter i was wondering why that wasnâ t the case in u s or was it and you just kind of overcame that garry ridge correct it was and we overcame it in the u s i think i mentioned in the call that the results were particularly pleasing in the u s because we did have some buy up against price rise last year but our programs this year enabled us to combat and beat that in this fiscal year operator your next question is from rosemarie morbelli with g research your line is open rosemarie morbelli thank you good afternoon everyone and congratulations to all the promotions and for the succession plan garry ridge thank you rosemarie morbelli so i was wondering if you could give us a better feel for pricing versus volume and what do you expect going forward for the balance of the year garry ridge most of the gains that youâ ll see in the balance of the year our volume pricing has already been factored into our trading so jay i think that would be about correct jay rembolt for the remainder of the year yes yes we donâ t see any additional pricing increases rosemarie morbelli and do you see your raw material costs continuing to come down any change on the cans for example in addition to the petroleum jay rembolt actually cans have gone up thereâ s probably some residual impact of tariffs even though we buy our cans in the u s and in places very close to where we sell our product there is there has been some increase in can costs and itâ s somewhat coincident with the timing of tariffs rosemarie morbelli and what do you hear in terms of tariff anecdotally by your customers in the different regions is the outlook kind of improving or is it or the positiveness that one may have had a year ago it really has moved all the way into the negative territory garry ridge i wouldnâ t say things have moved into the negative i think thereâ s a continuing uncertainty out there youâ ve got a number of things that are impacting us at the moment the uncertainties around brexit the uncertainties around trade talks so we can as most companies and most people deal with risks they have a real problem dealing with uncertainty so that seems to be some of it but i wouldnâ t say itâ s gone to negative i would say itâ s moderate rosemarie morbelli okay and then lastly if i may you are looking at revenues being closer to the lower end of your expectations and the eps now lower end of your previous high end so is the benefit solely from the lower tax rate or are there other factors in between that are going to allow you to have a higher margin in order to get to those members jay rembolt yes they all come from the change in tax for the most part rosemarie morbelli nothing else no other benefits anywhere else jay rembolt there could be but itâ s too soon to tell operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our allotted time for questions we thank you for your participation on todayâ s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line

j bradford delong why did the policy response to the great recession only partly reflect the lessons learned from the great depression until recently the smart money was on the answers given by the financial times commentator martin wolf and my berkeley colleague barry eichengreen each has argued that while enough was remembered to prevent the 1929 size shock of 2008 from producing another great depression many lessons were plowed under by a rightward ideological shift in the years following the crisis since then the fact that the worst was avoided has served as an alibi for a suboptimal status quo now nobel laureate economist paul krugman has offered an alternative explanation plutocracy at the start of the 2010s the top 0 01 percent 30 000 people around the world half of them in the united states cared little about high unemployment which didn t seem to affect them but were greatly alarmed by government debt they began demanding austerity and as krugman contends the political and media establishment internalized the preferences of the extremely wealthy would the us economy of the 2010s have been materially different if the share of total income accruing to the top 0 01 percent had not quadrupled in recent decades from 1 3 percent to 5 percent krugman certainly thinks so while vigilance can mitigate the extent to which the wealthy get to define the policy agenda he writes in the end big money will find a way unless there s less big money to begin with hence curbing plutocracy should be america s top priority in fact big money does not always find a way nor does its influence necessarily increase as the top 0 01 percent captures a larger share of total income whether the average plutocrat has 1 000 or 50 000 times more than the average worker makes little difference in this respect more to the point big money wasn t the primary determinant of whether policymakers heeded or forgot the lessons of the great depression for example one lesson from that earlier episode is that high unemployment is extremely unhealthy for an economy and society a depression is not as the early 20th century economist joseph schumpeter once claimed a good cold douche for the economy but this lesson was forgotten only by a lunatic fringe some of whom suggested that the great recession was needed to shift workers out of bloated sectors such as home construction as for lessons that were forgotten one is that persistent ultra low interest rates means the economy is still short of safe liquid stores of value and thus in need of further monetary expansion during and after the great recession denying this plain truth and calling for an end to stimulus became a litmus test for any republican holding or seeking office worse these politicians were joined by an astonishingly large number of conservative economists who conveniently seemed to forget that the short term safe interest rate is a good thermometer for the economy to be sure big finance did play a role here by insisting that the fed was trying to push value away from fundamentals even though economic fundamentals are generally whatever the fed says they are but an even more obvious culprit was hyper partisanship another lesson is that printing or borrowing money to buy stuff is an effective means for governments to address worryingly high unemployment after 2009 the obama administration effectively rejected this lesson in favor of the logic of austerity even though the unemployment rate was still 9 9 percent a related lesson is that high levels of government debt need not lead to price instability or an inflationary spiral as john maynard keynes argued in january 1937 the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity at the treasury unfortunately in the early 2010s those of us who recalled this lesson were consigned to the margins of debate yet here big money influence was a secondary problem compared with the democratic party s broader surrender to neoliberalism which started under president bill clinton but reached its apotheosis in the obama era after all the plutocracy itself profits when money is cheap and lending is dear the larger issue then is an absence of alternative voices if the 2010s had been anything like the 1930s the national association of manufacturers and the conference board would have been aggressively calling for more investment in america and these arguments would have commanded the attention of the press labor unions would have had a prominent voice as advocates for a high pressure economy both would have had very powerful voices inside the political process through their support of candidates did the top 0 01 percent put something in the water to make the media freeze out such voices after 2008 did the ultra wealthy create our modern campaign finance system in which elite social networks and door to door canvassing are less important than a candidate s fundraising totals the problem is not so much that the plutocracy has grown stronger as that countervailing powers have disappeared after all there are wealthy donors and philanthropists on the left as well as the right and some billionaires have even started to demand that they be taxed more of course the political implications of plutocracy are dangerous and destructive in the us olin money has captured the judiciary koch money has misinformed the public about global warming and murdoch money routinely terrifies retirees about immigrants but just because the public sphere is tainted and skewed by plutocratic influence does not mean that more rational policymaking is doomed once we are aware of the problem we can begin to work around it krugman admits as much when he warns centrist politicians and the media not to pull another 2011 treating the policy preferences of the 0 1 percent as the right thing as opposed to well what a certain small class of people want for journalists academics elected officials and concerned citizens generally the first task is to ask oneself everyday whose voices are getting more attention than they deserve and who isn t being heard at all ultimately it is the public that will decide the fate of the public sphere j bradford delong a former deputy assistant us treasury secretary is professor of economics at the university of california at berkeley and a research associate at the national bureau of economic research ed
earlier this year the institute on taxation and economic policy a liberal think tank reported that amazon one of the most valuable corporations in the world paid no federal taxes on a supposed 11 2 billion in profits in 2018 many americans felt outraged and shortly thereafter senator elizabeth warren introduced a plan to force companies like amazon to pay their fair share of taxes but in this case the outrage was somewhat misplaced we should not be astonished that amazon pays no taxes for the simple reason that it doesn t actually turn a profit while the company used accounting techniques to show a positive cash flow on paper its zero dollar tax bill more accurately reflects the nature of the business today many firms not just amazon have adopted a growth strategy based on rapid expansion and negative cash flow they are propped up by investors and by low interest rates that provide cheap and easy access to capital they can t be unprofitable forever the thinking goes and they must have an exit strategy even if they don t share it publicly until then they continue to hemorrhage cash in their quest for an ever greater market share the orthodox narrative on wall street is that these firms are reinvesting what would otherwise be profits instead of sharing them with investors and shareholders this narrative suggests that we are witnessing one of the greatest wealth transfers in the history of capitalism by investing all their profits back into the firm these companies are essentially transferring wealth from their investors to us the consumers however it s unclear how or even whether that s actually happening selling below cost is a classic way for aspiring monopolists to seize market share from smaller competitors who can t afford to consistently lose money this technique known as predatory pricing is bad for consumers and the economy as a whole because it drives companies out of the market not because they re less competitive or efficient but because they don t have enough funds to survive without turning a profit that s why predatory pricing is illegal under federal antitrust law today the u s economy is rife with spectacularly valuable corporations that fail to turn a profit relying on the continuing faith of investors it s not just amazon uber netflix and wework are some of the many other examples to the average person these companies appear to be using super low prices to gain market share but if predatory pricing is illegal how can this be happening the answer is that what the average person thinks about amazon s business strategy doesn t matter because the supreme court has all but defined predatory pricing out of existence taking cues from the conservative law and economics movement the court has held that the strategy is irrational as a matter of economic theory because for it to pay off the monopolist will have to recoup today s losses by raising prices dramatically in the future but that won t work the logic goes because when they do competitors will swoop in and offer the same service or product at lower prices frustrating the entire scheme under that thinking the court has set up rules making it nearly impossible to prove that predatory pricing is happening but the court and most antitrust scholars have been making a systematic mistake the prevailing doctrine assumes that there is only one way for a company to recoup its losses once it has cornered the market raising prices it ignores the other half of the profit equation costs this is a serious error because giants like amazon have tremendous power to lower costs by squeezing other parties like employees and suppliers when you take both costs and prices into account predatory pricing begins to look much more rational and therefore more common than the courts have imagined to the average person companies like amazon uber netflix and wework appear to be using super low prices to gain market share but if predatory pricing is illegal how can this be happening in early june the federal trade commission department of justice and house antitrust subcommittee all announced that they would be opening investigations into tech companies so far they haven t said anything about whether they will look into predatory pricing it would be a mistake not to amazon and the other unicorns on wall street claim to be heavily investing in innovation now to reap the benefits in the future but there is reason to believe that in addition to making these legitimate investments they are spending heavily to subsidize selling below cost in other words they may be getting away with predatory pricing in broad daylight if federal regulators don t start asking the right questions however we may not know until it s much too late predatory pricing is not a new phenomenon it was one of the allegations brought against john d rockefeller s standard oil in 1911 when the supreme court decided to break up the company in subsequent decisions the court came to hold that the practice was illegal under federal antitrust laws the rationale was simple it s good when a company gets so efficient that it can charge less than its rivals but if a company reduces prices below its own costs then that doesn t reflect efficiency and must instead be aimed at cornering the market that s harmful to consumers in the long run because eventually the company will start charging higher prices than it would if it hadn t crushed the competition through the late 1970s cases involving predatory pricing were common but critics pointed out that the courts lacked a consistent framework for deciding whether it was happening in a given situation in 1975 a groundbreaking harvard law review article established a straightforward test to prove that a company s pricing scheme is predatory a plaintiff must show both that the prices are below the cost of producing a single product or service and that using that strategy to eliminate competitors is economically rational the scheme counts as rational if the firm will be able to recoup its losses in the future through higher profits earned in the absence of competition the whole point of having a monopoly but just a few years later this formula was subtly revised in his 1978 magnum opus the antitrust paradox which provided the blueprint for a conservative counterrevolution in the field robert bork narrowed the definition of recoupment from turning a profit to specifically charging higher prices and any company whose strategy depended on raising prices in the future he reasoned would run into the problem of new competitors emerging to undercut them predatory pricing he concluded was almost always irrational and courts should be highly suspicious of parties bringing forward such claims that position like most of bork s views on antitrust made its way into the official doctrine of the supreme court which assumed that investors and shareholders would refuse to allow companies to lose money on a scheme that was unlikely to work and so according to the judiciary and mainstream antitrust lawyers we have little to fear from the practices of companies that sell products and services for ridiculously low prices year after year without making a profit but the rise of platforms that are both insanely valuable and persistently unprofitable has made the court s assumptions look increasingly shaky as amazon netflix and uber have shown investors and shareholders can be more than willing to tolerate losses if they expect the firm to eventually translate these losses into a money making scheme the question is how as i argued in a paper recently published in the oxford journal of antitrust enforcement scholars on both sides of the antitrust debate have been overlooking the other side of the predatory pricing equation lowering costs without passing those savings along to the consumer take amazon while the company publicly claims to be profitable it has reported a cash outflow in statements filed with the securities and exchange commission as recently as the end of 2017 that means that once various debt obligations were taken into account amazon was losing money for example for the 2017 calendar year it reported a net cash outflow of 1 5 billion this raises the question if amazon is indeed losing money because it is pricing below cost what s its strategy for recouping those losses down the line in my paper i argued that amazon which dominates nearly 50 percent of all e commerce might eventually recoup its losses by growing so efficient that tomorrow s costs drop far below today s prices then in the absence of competition it would face little pressure to pass the savings onto customers however in the weeks that followed the publication of the paper a more ominous hypothesis occurred to me it begins with the fact that amazon s e commerce business is really composed of two main parts in the first amazon operates as a retailer buying products in bulk from vendors and then selling directly to consumers under this model amazon bears all of the costs associated with storage fulfillment and shipping this operation is similar to a traditional brick and mortar shop the second branch is the amazon marketplace a virtual mall in which sellers pay amazon for the right to display and sell their goods on its platform the crucial difference is that in the marketplace sellers shoulder the costs associated with storage and fulfillment in recent years the share of the marketplace has grown dramatically in 2001 6 percent of merchandise sales on amazon came through the marketplace today the figure is around 58 percent here we see the potential for amazon to recoup its losses in a way that robert bork never imagined instead of raising consumer prices amazon can sell the same products for the same price but push more and more vendors to become third party sellers on the marketplace offloading the costs of fulfillment and allowing amazon to charge those same entities higher fees this recoupment process appears to be under way bloomberg recently reported that amazon was preparing for a supplier purge ceasing to buy from thousands of wholesale vendors and pushing them instead to become sellers on the marketplace at the same time there is anecdotal evidence that amazon is making terms less generous to sellers so that amazon keeps a bigger cut of the money coming in in early may i was contacted by the ceo of a company that has generated over 65 million in revenue on the marketplace over the last five years he spoke on the condition of anonymity since he relies on amazon for his livelihood but agreed to let me look at his company s books his story matched accounts i ve heard from other sellers until recently the ceo explained amazon treated his company well because sellers like him solved a key problem big brands were refusing to sell directly to amazon meaning their products were unavailable on the site sellers on the marketplace filled this crucial void they would buy products from the big brands and then sell them on amazon thereby circumventing the embargo amazon treated sellers like royalty in exchange for instance the ceo explained the company charged unusually low fees for storing his company s products and if amazon made a mistake in the fulfillment process or lost products shipped by sellers it would quickly reimburse them no questions asked and most importantly it offered its own fulfillment services known as fulfilled by amazon or fba at extremely low prices far lower than what it would have cost the ceo to fulfill orders on his own those were the good days he said when his business grew from just under 1 5 million to more than 6 million in annual revenue the supreme court assumed that investors and shareholders would refuse to allow companies to lose money year after year but the rise of platforms that are both insanely valuable and persistently unprofitable has made the court s assumptions look increasingly shaky but now he fears that his company s days are numbered due to ever shrinking profit margins what happened first fba became much more expensive if back in 2014 fulfillment fees stood at 17 percent of the seller s total costs they are currently hovering at about 27 percent second amazon now charges much more for inventory storage over the past four years the monthly rate per cubic foot that the ceo pays has increased by over 40 percent add to this the fact that more recently the ceo said he has had to pay amazon for advertising for his products to have a chance of appearing at the top of search results in the past a successful product could top the list without a boost from ad money amazon touts that it continuously invests in research and development and improving vertical integration such as buying its own fleet of planes ever striving toward greater cost efficiencies it s hard for the ceo to square that with the fact that fulfillment services fees have grown by about 60 percent as a proportion of his costs over the past five years why not leave amazon fulfillment then it s too risky the ceo explained even if he could raise enough capital to set up an efficient fulfillment infrastructure his company would risk bankruptcy in the event that amazon suspended its account for any missed or delayed deliveries and leaving amazon entirely would be suicide for most sellers all in all it appears that if amazon was indeed engaging in predatory pricing it has now moved on to the recoupment phase by shifting the costs of fulfillment onto third parties and by squeezing higher commissions and fees from those sellers by amazon s own account those represent one of the company s fastest growing sources of revenue in 2018 amazon s cut of the revenue from third party sellers totaled 42 7 billion which translated to nearly one out of every five dollars the company made the threat of predatory pricing goes far beyond amazon uber for instance has been up front in public announcements including the paperwork for its ipo about the fact that it is running its uber pool service at a loss in order to gain market share and it has even discussed the need to recoup its losses by lowering the cut of fares that drivers receive it s far from clear that uber s strategy will work as its lackluster ipo suggests the ride share industry may be impossible to monopolize since the barriers to entry for new rivals are relatively low but uber is just one high profile example wework another cash burning mammoth gearing up for an ipo is another it could be leasing and buying office space around the world in order to attract customers only to recoup its losses by squeezing landlords once it snatches up a large enough market share of the world s prime real estate ultimately however we generally lack concrete evidence that these companies have been charging below cost the key way to determine whether predatory pricing is taking place because that information is not part of mandatory corporate disclosures similarly we can t know for sure that the squeeze amazon sellers are feeling these days is part of a recoupment plan but the available indicators should be triggering alarm bells in washington as part of their upcoming investigations of the tech industry the federal trade commission department of justice and house antitrust subcommittee should make companies turn over the information that would show whether they re violating the prohibition on predatory pricing for a more forward looking solution regulators should create new rules requiring companies that consistently lose money to submit a confidential report showing whether they re pricing below cost the good news is that at least one powerful member of the judiciary which wields disproportionate power over how antitrust law is applied seems somewhat attuned to the dangers of corporations that use their position as a dominant buyer to impose unfair terms on sellers a phenomenon known as monopsony power instead of raising consumer prices amazon can push more and more vendors to become third party sellers on the marketplace offloading the costs of fulfillment and allowing amazon to charge those same entities higher fees this process appears to be under way as the judge put it in a 2017 decision of the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit he exercise of monopsony power to temporarily reduce consumer prices does not qualify as an efficiency that can justify an otherwise anti competitive although both monopsony and bargaining power result in lower input prices ordinary bargaining power usually results in lower prices for consumers whereas monopsony power usually does not at least over the long term that was brett kavanaugh now a member of the supreme court and perhaps surprisingly a potential swing justice when it comes to antitrust law in may kavanaugh joined the court s four liberals to allow an antitrust case to proceed against apple based on the terms it imposes on third party developers in the app store a retailer who is both a monopolist and a monopsonist may be liable to different classes of plaintiffs both to downstream consumers and to upstream suppliers when the retailer s unlawful conduct affects both the downstream and upstream markets he wrote in the majority opinion there s no doubt that negative cash flow juggernauts like amazon have used technological innovations to provide consumers with excellent services at a fantastic bargain the question is whether they are also using illegal tactics to push competitors including tomorrow s would be innovators out of the market if they are and they aren t stopped soon we will likely come to find that the bargain wasn t worth it

expectations of lower interest rates the s p 500 index briefly traded over 3 000 for the first time testifying to the house financial services committee powell was asked as he has been before what he would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence that he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion that he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms that he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude that a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a likely rate cut late this month as an insurance policy against an economic downturn i think it will be the start of a series of rate cuts added sung won sohn economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles powell wants to provide fuel for the economy down the road expectations of a pending rate cut drew additional support wednesday when the fed released the minutes of its june 18 19 meeting the central bank held rates unchanged then but the minutes showed that some officials felt looser credit could soon be needed to address economic weakness investors have collectively put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 after it raised rates four times last year action that incited the initial attacks on the powell fed from trump in the prepared remarks he delivered wednesday before taking questions from the house members powell made no mention of the president s criticism he did thank congress for the independence it has given the fed to operate free of political intrusion but later in the question and answer period several democratic committee members offered support for powell s leadership and a rejection of trump s criticism rep maxine waters who leads the committee declared that this president has made it clear that he has no understanding or respect for the independence of the federal reserve waters and other democrats urged powell to stand up to trump s attacks have no fear rep david scott d ga told the chairman we in congress both democrats and republicans have got your back powell s remarks wednesday began two days of his testimony on capitol hill on thursday he will address the senate banking committee at the moment the u s economic landscape is a mixed one the job market appears resilient but economic growth is slowing many forecasters predict that growth has slowed to an annual rate of around 2 in the just completed april june quarter in his testimony powell said the economy has fared reasonably well over the first half of the year but he noted that crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook he said that growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably possibly because of concerns over slowing global growth and the trade battle between the trump administration and china the fed chairman told the house committee that he thinks average worker pay isn t rising fast enough to accelerate low inflation even with the unemployment rate near a five decade low an absence of inflation pressure makes it easier for the fed to cut short term rates referring to rates powell repeated a pledge the fed made in its june policy statement that officials would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion but notably he added that many fed official saw that the case for a looser monetary policy had strengthened the fed hasn t cut rates since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis trump and chinese president xi jinping declared a truce last month in what had threatened to become an escalating u s china trade war and agreed to resume talks toward a deal that would meet the administration s demands to better protect u s technology that step eased fears that trump would extend punitive tariffs to an additional 300 billion in chinese goods in the process inviting retaliation from beijing on american exports and likely weakening both nations economies and last week the government reported that after a tepid job gain in may u s employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june an indication of the economy s durability copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

since elections last may in malaysia brought to power the country s opposition for the first time in history the ruling pakatan harapan ph government led by mahathir mohamad has come under scrutiny for the slow pace of reforms among the major areas in question is the economy which continues to be watched closely in the context of broader trends and developments including malaysia s alignments with foreign powers and the country s expected hosting of the asia pacific economic cooperation summit apec in 2020 the diplomat s senior editor prashanth parameswaran recently spoke to shankaran nambiar a senior research fellow at the malaysian institute of economic research about the state of malaysia s economy its future trajectory and its wider implications for malaysia s domestic and foreign policy under the ph government the ph government is operating under a seemingly challenging context domestically and internationally with developments such as the weight of public expectations as well the u s china trade war there will also be continued interest in the malaysian economy through to next year including as the country prepares to host the asia pacific economic cooperation summit apec in 2020 how would you characterize the current context in which the ph government is operating it s certainly a challenging environment both domestically and internationally the ph government is saddled with immense debts inherited from the previous regime that it is obliged to fulfill but then the reality on the ground runs against easily achievable solutions against this context ph is trying to distinguish itself from the previous government but without a framework or ideology that is sufficiently different the possibility of china s growth softening does not help neither does the likelihood of a prolonged u s china trade war or slowing global growth the public both households and businesses had expected a new economic model with malaysia s new government coming in the initial excitement seems to have died down giving way to harsh realities one manufacturer s association claimed its members felt that the introduction of the sst raised their cost of doing business the public may not be lowering their expectations out of a sense of sympathy for the tough tasks that ph has to face since coming to power the ph government has faced a series of domestic policy challenges with respect to the economy including managing a huge debt burden and finding sources of growth while it is still early days we have seen some indications of the government s approach be it the retraction of the goods and services tax gst or the issuance of budget 2019 what is your assessment of how the government has fared so far it appears as if the government is trying to find its own voice a timbre that is quite unique and people friendly it is not clear if the government has been successful in doing so or if the voice it has found for itself has been convincing indeed the government retracted the gst but that has not been without any cost the retraction of the gst was prompted by an election promise to repeal the tax but removing the tax and replacing it with the sst has created a tax revenue shortfall that throws the government back on further reliance on revenue from oil something that tosses the government into the throes of oil price volatility and uncertainty the government has taken comfort in using a definition of debt that is at variance with international practice ie what the imf for instance uses it has also highlighted the loss of government money following the irresponsible expenditure undertaken by the previous government eg projects that were supposed to have been done but weren t that is fine as a political statement it is fine as a declaration of the excesses committed by the previous government but this does not show the road forward it does not inspire confidence in the path ahead something that is so very much required as we face the prospect of choppy times we ve also seen the ph government move to address malaysia s economic challenges and also capitalize on opportunities through its foreign policy whether it be on palm oil and europe or infrastructure projects with china and the belt and road initiative how would you assess some of these key foreign economic policy moves are there particular elements of continuity and change on foreign economic policy that are visible relative to the previous government under najib razak on palm oil malaysia has put up a bold objection to the eu it has sought to up the ante with a tit for tat move that reads as follows if you won t buy palm oil from us we won t buy fighter jets from you and indeed malaysia can use the palm oil offset strategy there would be takers including china and russia but that is not going to change the eu s position on palm oil in fact the eu has had roughly the same set of complaints against palm oil for decades aside from making a strong point it is not clear if the stand will help change the eu position on palm oil on projects with china and the bri we have seen a complete turnaround from the present government the prime minister has been on record criticizing china for its neocolonialist ways he now has revised his position on the infrastructure projects albeit with some modifications sure the cost of some of these projects has gone down but the specifications have been changed as well it is not as if china has simply given malaysia a discount on these projects when confronted with the reality on the ground the present government has found that it has few options but to acquiesce to china because after all malaysia faces a tough domestic economy high debts and china offers the promise of investment besides already being malaysia s top trade partner the ph government is also operating amid a broader regional picture where various regional trade agreements are at play including the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep and the new comprehensive partnership for a trans pacific partnership cptpp what do you see as the future prospects for these agreements and how do they play into how malaysia is managing economic challenges and opportunities in his earlier incarnation as prime minister mahathir did recognize the value of regional agreements but with a political slant that sought to reduce the west s dominance whilst including china and of course giving strength to asean this perspective had some elements of the nonalignment thinking that was characteristic of his era it probably made sense to form a regional grouping that would not be subject to u s dominance or rather a grouping that could form a counterbalance to the u s power today there is still sense in trying to assert a stronger more independent asean the only difference though is that 30 years ago one did not have to worry too much about china s reach whereas today to maintain a nonaligned position might mean leaning towards the united states a declining power given the fact that the increasingly likely situation is for southeast asian states to lean towards beijing mahathir probably wants to retain some aspects of his earlier thinking he would want to place asean in the center of his regional trade agreements it is unlikely that he would want to play a leadership position in asean but he would want to support rcep and he would want to see china play a bigger role in the region he has talked about a rcep with china in it but without india australia and new zealand in the arrangement for the moment it is not clear how long this moment will last although the thought of such a moment is in itself fascinating as for the cptpp malaysia must be in something of a bind it has signed the agreement but has yet to ratify it not ratifying will be an embarrassment but there are two reasons to balk at a agreement first it is reminiscent of the najib era second it is seen as being u s inspired and worse yet without the presence of the united states if the clock could be turned back mahathir would probably not have gone into negotiations on the tpp in the first place at any rate mahathir will want to turn his attention to three issues the consequences of the cptpp on the cost of healthcare the isds and government procurement these are issues on which he has held strong views if he decides to turn his back on the cptpp malaysia s tilt to china will be more pronounced from an economic point of view that may serve malaysia well there are a number of indicators that will be important for hints as to how the malaysian economy will fare including interest rates and the weight of public expectations what are some of the other key domestic and international indicators that you will be looking to several institutions have put malaysia s growth forecast for the year at about 4 7 percent less optimistic economists have placed the figure at 4 5 percent or slightly lower the prime minister himself has been optimistic and has offered a growth rate of 5 percent for 2019 the external environment does not warrant a great deal of optimism the country has not solved its public debt equation the household debt situation at 83 percent of gdp in 2018 remains high within the regional context and the gdp growth figure is likely to soften the ringgit has been dropping against the u s dollar in recent quarters the sentiments of consumers and businesses have been weak at best perhaps declining households perceive the cost of living to remain high the government has promised to construct a cost of living index what is at stake is public perception of the high cost of living which a new index will not help mitigate some of the things that will give some indication of the future include how the 2020 budget will turn out the 12th malaysia plan and the fourth industrial master plan these plan documents may give more reason for optimism and the path forward particularly crucial are indications of future sources of government revenue and new growth areas the finance minister has admitted that he is not a magician which he surely is not and would need three years to put the economy back on track this is not comforting since this year and the next are likely to be testing years the economy definitely needs a huge shot of confidence to keep the animal spirits up the government seems to be ignoring this side of things in its preoccupation to shore up its political appeal
there s a lot not to like about what passes for trump s economic policy but the financial times martin wolf s critique of it in donald trump s boom will prove to be hot air leaves a lot to be desired the fact that boom appears in the headline is a big tell it s a reasonable surmise that trump will be re elected unless the economy falls out of bed despite his long and ever growing list of offenses and crappy policies trump is a master at keeping the spotlight turned on him democratic party leaders by contrast seem to think that trump is so obviously odious that being not trump and other forms of virtue signaling will prove sufficient for them to retake the white house never mind that the party is doing as little as it possibly can to address issues that affect ordinary americans like stagnant real wages ever escalating medical costs student debt and the seeming impossibility of retiring on a diet better than cat food except as required to neutralize bernie sanders and to a lesser degree elizabeth warren however trump gets support from the business community securities touts and political leaders who benefit by peddling optimism whether warranted or not most look at results over a comparatively short horizon even wolf who does make some key longer term comparisons to cast doubt on what trump presents as his accomplishments fails to look at the bigger context the us is in the late stages of a shallow and long expansion by historical standards michal kalecki described how that that would become the new normal in his seminal 1943 essay on the barriers to achieving full employment if you haven t read this lucid piece please stop now and study it and par for the course as we ll address shortly kalecki predicts wolf s main critique of trump that he s running supposedly bad for you deficits note that the fact that trump is running deficits at all is a no no made worse by the fact that the resulting stimulus was less effective by virtue of his tax cuts overwhelmingly benefiting the rich from kalecki emphasis ours we shall deal first with the reluctance of the captains of industry to accept government intervention in the matter of employment every widening of state activity is looked upon by business with suspicion but the creation of employment by government spending has a special aspect which makes the opposition particularly intense under a laissez faire system the level of employment depends to a great extent on the so called state of confidence if this deteriorates private investment declines which results in a fall of output and employment both directly and through the secondary effect of the fall in incomes upon consumption and investment this gives the capitalists a powerful indirect control over government policy everything which may shake the state of confidence must be carefully avoided because it would cause an economic crisis but once the government learns the trick of increasing employment by its own purchases this powerful controlling device loses its effectiveness hence budget deficits necessary to carry out government intervention must be regarded as perilous the social function of the doctrine of sound finance is to make the level of employment dependent on the state of confidence it is frustrating to see wolf land only glancing blows trump s claims such as taking credit for supposedly low unemployment wolf seems to content himself with looking at macro data without considering underlying structural changes such as the long standing and highly successful attack on worker bargaining rights wolf gives trump credit for decent but not stellar gdp growth attributing it to his fiscal stimulus the conclusion is that the economy has responded to a big fiscal stimulus roughly as the best forecasters predicted that upsurge is unlikely to last the big tax cuts have as intended hugely benefited owners of corporations but they have certainly not paid for themselves they have left the long term fiscal position fragile it s hard to accept even this qualified sunny view when the share of economic expansions going to workers as opposed to profits has been falling since the early 2000s this site daily has evidence of how wobbly most american s finances are such as the fact that nearly 40 of americans don t have the cash to handle an unexpected 400 expense or that car sales are at the level of 1999 despite the industry s ever more lavish financing schemes or deteriorating indictors of social well being like falling life expectancy and more than half of all births happening outside marriages points out that the headline unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 1969 while failing to consider that high levels of involuntary part time employment make that metric less valid as a barometer of the strength of the labor market wolf does cast doubts but by looking at pay levels and the labor participation rate there has been a modest rise in the growth of average hourly earnings of private employees from 2 4 per cent in the year to january 2017 to 3 1 per cent in the year to june 2019 but this rate has stabilised over the past year in real terms average weekly earnings rose just 1 per cent in the year to may 2019 if the tax cuts brought much to working people it is certainly more via additional jobs than rising real earnings yet participation in the labour market by men and women aged between 25 and 55 is still below past peaks prime age male participation was 89 per cent in june 2019 against 96 per cent in early 1970 for women it was 76 per cent in june 2019 against a peak of 77 per cent in april 2000 the decline in unemployment has to be put in this context labour force participation has fallen dramatically in the case of prime age men the secular rise in participation stopped two decades ago in the case of prime aged women it is also frustrating to see wolf dignify bad conventional wisdom the big economic justification for lower taxes on corporations is that it would raise investment the ratio of real non residential private fixed investment to gdp was 13 8 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 this is only 0 8 percentage points higher than in the last quarter of 2016 it is also well within the historic ratios the paper by profs barro and furman suggest that the changed tax treatment of corporations should have a modest upward effect on growth largely through higher cumulative investment but the impact would only be to raise gdp over 10 years by 0 2 0 4 percentage points for the most part businesses do not invest because they have retained earnings sitting around if the opportunity is attractive they can raise funds by borrowing or selling equity they invest because they see opportunity that said there would be some improvement in the expected free cash flow from investment projects at a lower tax rate and that could generate some additional investment but why in this globalized world would one assume that would necessarily lead to investment that was significantly in the us virtually from when china joined the wto large companies in advanced economies have been net saving which means dis investing as china has stepped into the role of being the world s foundry wolf doesn t even acknowledge the degree to which the tax cuts funded yet more stock buybacks from forbes the tax cut and jobs act tcja of december 2017 had two main provisions affecting corporate taxes first it reduced corporate taxes changing them from a graduated structure with a maximum rate of 35 to a flat rate of 21 second it changed taxation of foreign profits previously these profits weren t taxed until repatriated so companies kept their profits abroad the underlying logic for the tcja was that allowing companies to keep a greater share of profits would stimulate investments in long term growth instead the dominant company response to the tcja was stock buybacks for the first three quarters of 2018 buybacks were 583 4 billion up up 52 6 from 2017 in contrast aggregate capital investment increased 8 8 over 2017 while r d investment growth at us public companies increased 12 5 over 2017 growth and there may be other trump factors that contributed to the uptick in investment staring with his big push for even more lax regulation most businesses equate lower regulation with higher profit potential and that alone could have generated more investment at the margin wolf makes deficit spending as opposed to say starting trade wars bullying the fed or government shutdowns as trump s economic original sin it s disheartening to see mainstream economists continue to decry spending by currency issuers when the real hazard to economic health is private debt and nowhere do we see any consideration of resource limits or the need to mitigate climate change donald trump s main policy has been a regressive form of keynesianism masked as corporate tax reform the latter delivered huge gains to shareholders it has brought a strong short term stimulus which has had good effects on unemployment whether current unemployment rates are sustainable is unknown but they cannot go on falling forever the effects on long term growth are likely to be modest though running the economy this hot just might generate an upsurge in investment and so growth given the pressure on the federal reserve to keep pouring on petrol this could end in tears with higher inflation and interest rates and damaged fiscal and monetary credibility it is too soon to laud trumponomics but it is not too soon to note where the us is heading it is hard to imagine anybody standing up for fiscal prudence the choice is rather between rightwing and leftwing keynesians in the long run that is likely to end badly but that could be a very long run threatening to put the brakes on federal spending when many americans are under stress is one way to help trump win but as we can see from wolf s own article orthodox economists have abandoned real wage growth meaning how ordinary people are doing as the key metric of sound policy and the lack of concern about real people is also why they stick their heads in the sand as far as species loss and climate change are concerned

by kelsey johnson and fergal smith ottawa toronto july 10 reuters the bank of canada on wednesday looks set to raise its second quarter economic growth forecast and stand pat on interest rates taking a different tack from some major peers which are signaling plans for additional stimulus the central bank will release its quarterly monetary policy report at 10 a m eastern 1400 gmt in which it is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at 1 75 but analysts expect the central bank to raise its projection for second quarter annualized growth to between 2 25 and 3 from 1 3 forecast in april the expected boost to the growth projection comes after a sharp drop in global bond yields helped reduce borrowing costs for canada s heavily indebted household sector the bank of canada set a pretty low bar in terms of its second quarter growth numbers said royce mendes a senior economist at cibc capital markets the central bank has long forecast that the economy would recover from a recent slowdown triggered by low oil prices and the dampening effect of interest rate rises what remains unclear is how sustainable the expected second quarter gains are by comparison the u s federal reserve the reserve bank of australia and the european central bank have taken a more dovish approach to monetary policy the fed has signaled a rate cut could come as soon as the end of july due to growing risks to u s economic growth the canadian dollar has been the top performing g10 currency this year as traders bet that canada s central bank would diverge from expected easing by the federal reserve the bank of canada will have to decide whether it believes that there s further for this momentum to go said mendes noting that the oil producing province of alberta has partially lifted production cutbacks the bank has held its overnight rate at 1 75 since last october it s not just growth divergence it s an inflation divergence said greg anderson of bmo capital markets canada is at target and nobody else is while canadian inflation has reached the bank of canada s 2 target the economy has seen other gains too first quarter consumption levels were higher than expected rbc capital markets strategist mark chandler said adding that business hiring and capital spending intentions had held up pretty well but global trade tensions could prompt the bank to cut its forecast for the world economy mendes said noting the united states had slapped more tariffs on chinese goods since the bank s april forecasts other potentially negative factors weighing on the bank s projections include the stronger canadian dollar s undercutting competitiveness the appreciating canadian dollar means that canada s level of competitiveness on the global stage is even more deteriorated than it was before said mendes reporting by kelsey johnson and fergal smith editing by dan grebler

russia and china are forging stronger ties gaining ground on the u s and rattling washington writes dilip hiro by dilip hiro tomdispatch com president donald trump was partly voted into office by americans who felt that the self proclaimed greatest power on earth was actually in decline and they weren t wrong trump is capable of tweeting many things but none of those tweets will stop that process of decline nor will a trade war with a rising china or fierce oil sanctions on iran you could feel this recently even in the case of the increasingly pressured iranians there with a single pinprick supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei effectively punctured trump s maga balloon and reminded many that however powerful the u s still was people in other countries were beginning to look at america differently at the end of the second decade of the twenty first century following a meeting in tehran with visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe who brought a message from trump urging the start of u s iranian negotiations khamenei tweeted we have no doubt in goodwill and seriousness but regarding what you mentioned from u s president i don t consider trump as a person deserving to exchange messages with and i have no answer for him nor will i respond to him in the future he then added we believe that our problems will not be solved by negotiating with the u s and no free nation would ever accept negotiations under pressure a flustered trump was reduced to briefly tweeting i personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal they are not ready and neither are we while i very much appreciate p m abe going to iran to meet with ayatollah ali khamenei i personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal they are not ready and neither are we donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 13 2019 and soon after the president halted at the last minute in a distinctly humiliating retreat u s air strikes on iranian missile sites that would undoubtedly have created yet more insoluble problems for washington across the greater middle east keep in mind that globally before the ayatollah s put down the trump administration had already had two abject foreign policy failures the collapse of the president s hanoi summit with north korean leader kim jong un followed by that regime s provocative firing of several missiles over the sea of japan and a bungled attempt to overthrow the regime of venezuelan president nicolás maduro america s global standing at a record low what s great or small can be defined in absolute or relative terms america s greatness or exceptional or indispensable nature much lauded in washington before the trump era should certainly be judged against the economic progress made by china in those same years and against russia s advances in the latest high tech weaponry another way of assessing the nature of that greatness and what to make of it would be through polls of how foreigners view the united states take for instance a survey released by the pew research group in february 2019 forty five percent of respondents in 26 nations with large populations felt that american power and influence posed a major threat to our country while 36 percent offered the same response on russia and 35 percent on china to put that in perspective in 2013 during the presidency of barack obama only 25 percent of global respondents held such a negative view of the u s while reactions to china remained essentially the same or just consider the most powerful country in europe germany between 2013 and 2018 germans who considered american power and influence a greater threat than that of china or russia leapt from 19 percent to 49 percent figures for france were similar as for trump only 27 percent of global respondents had confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs while 70 feared he would not in mexico you undoubtedly won t be surprised to learn confidence in his leadership was at a derisory 6 percent in 17 of the surveyed countries people who lacked confidence in him were also significantly more likely to consider the u s the world s top threat a phenomenon most pronounced among traditional washington allies like canada great britain and australia china s expanding global footprint while 39 percent of pew respondents in that poll still rated the u s as the globe s leading economic power 34 percent opted for china meanwhile china s belt and road initiative bri launched in 2013 to link the infrastructure and trade of much of southeast asia eurasia and the horn of africa to china at an estimated cost of 4 trillion and to be funded by diverse sources is going from strength to strength one way to measure this the number of dignitaries attending the biennial bri forum in beijing the first of those gatherings in may 2017 attracted 28 heads of state and representatives from 100 countries the most recent in late april had 37 heads of state and representatives from nearly 150 countries and international organizations including international monetary fund imf chief christine lagarde and united nations secretary general antonio guterres leaders of nine out of 10 association of southeast asian nations attended as did four of the five central asian republics strikingly a third of the leaders participating came from europe according to peter frankopan author of the new silk roads more than 80 countries are now involved in some aspect of the bri project that translates into more than 63 percent of the world s population and 29 percent of its global economic output still chinese president xi jinping is intent on expanding the bri s global footprint further a signal of china s dream of future greatness during a february two day state visit to beijing by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman xi suggested that when it came to riyadh s overly ambitious economic plan our two countries should speed up the signing of an implementation plan on connecting the belt and road initiative with the saudi vision 2030 flattered by this proposal the crown prince defended china s use of re education camps for uighur muslims in its western province of xinjiang claiming it was beijing s right to carry out antiterrorism work to safeguard national security under the guise of combating extremism the chinese authorities have placed an estimated one million uighur muslims in such camps to undergo re education designed to supplant their islamic legacy with a chinese version of socialism uighur groups had appealed to prince bin salman to take up their cause no such luck one more sign of the rise of china in the 21st century china enters high tech race with america in 2013 germany launched an industry 4 0 plan meant to fuse cyber physical systems the internet of things cloud computing and cognitive computing with the aim of increasing manufacturing productivity by up to 50 percent while curtailing resources required by half two years later emulating this project beijing published its own 10 year made in china 2025 plan to update the country s manufacturing base by rapidly developing 10 high tech industries including electric cars and other new energy vehicles next generation information technology and telecommunications as well as advanced robotics and artificial intelligence aerospace engineering high end rail infrastructure and high tech maritime engineering as with bri the government and media then publicized and promoted made in china 2025 vigorously this alarmed washington and america s high tech corporations over the years american companies had complained about china s theft of u s intellectual property the counterfeiting of famous brands and the stealing of trade secrets not to speak of the pressuring of american firms in joint ventures with local companies to share technology as a price for gaining access to china s vast market their grievances became more vocal when donald trump entered the white house determined to cut washington s annual trade deficit of 380 billion with beijing as president trump ordered his new trade representative the sinophobe robert lighthizer to look into the matter the resulting seven month investigation pegged the loss u s companies experienced because of china s unfair trade practices at 50 billion a year that was why in march 2018 trump instructed lighthizer to levy tariffs on at least 50 billion worth of chinese imports that signaled the start of a sino american trade war which has only gained steam since in this context chinese officials started downplaying the significance of made in china 2025 describing it as nothing more than an inspirational plan this march china s national people s congress even passed a foreign direct investment law meant to address some of the grievances of u s companies its implementation mechanism was however weak trump promptly claimed that china had backtracked on its commitments to incorporate into chinese law significant changes the two countries had negotiated and put into a draft agreement to end the trade war he then slapped further tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports the major bone of contention for the trump administration is a chinese law specifying that in a joint venture between a foreign corporation and a chinese company the former must pass on technological know how to its chinese partner that s seen as theft by washington according to senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace yukon huang author of cracking the china conundrum why conventional economic wisdom is wrong however it s fully in accord with globally accepted guidelines such diffusion of technological know how has played a significant role in driving growth globally as the imf s 2018 world economic outlook report made clear it s worth noting as well that china now accounts for almost one third of global annual economic growth the size of china s market is so vast and the rise in its per capita gross domestic product from 312 in 1980 to 9 769 in 2018 is so steep that major u s corporations generally accepted its long established joint venture law and that should surprise no one last year for instance general motors sold 3 645 044 vehicles in china and fewer than 3 million in the u s little wonder then that late last year following gm plant closures across north america part of a wide ranging restructuring plan the company s management paid no heed to a threat from trump to strip gm of any government subsidies what angered the president as he tweeted caught the reality of the moment nothing was being closed in mexico and china what trump simply can t accept is this after nearly two decades of supply chain restructuring and global economic integration china has become thekey industrial supplier for the united states and europe his attempt to make america great again by restoring the economic status quo of before 2001 the year china was admitted to the world trade organization is doomed to fail in reality trade war or peace china is now beginning to overtake the u s in science and technology a study by qingnan xie of nanjing university of science and technology and richard freeman of harvard university noted that between 2000 and 2016 china s global share of publications in the physical sciences engineering and mathematics quadrupled and in the process exceeded that of the u s for the first time in the field of high technology for example china is now well ahead of the united states in mobile payment transactions in the first 10 months of 2017 those totaled 12 8 trillion the result of vast numbers of consumers discarding credit cards in favor of cashless systems in stark contrast according to emarketer america s mobile payment transactions in 2017 amounted to 49 3 billion last year 583 million chinese used mobile payment systems with nearly 68 percent of china s internet users turning to a mobile wallet for their offline payments russia s advanced weaponry in a similar fashion in his untiring pitch for america s beautiful weaponry trump has failed to grasp the impressive progress russia has made in that field while presenting videos and animated glimpses of new intercontinental ballistic missiles nuclear powered cruise missiles and underwater drones in a march 2018 television address russian president vladimir putin traced the development of his own country s new weapons to washington s decision to pull out of the 1972 anti ballistic missile abm treaty with the soviet union in december 2001 encouraged by john bolton then under secretary of state for arms control and international security president george w bush had indeed withdrawn from the 1972 abm treaty on the spurious grounds that the 9 11 attacks had changed the nature of defense for america his russian counterpart of the time the very same vladimir putin described the withdrawal from that cornerstone of world security as a grievous mistake the head of russia s armed forces general anatoly kvashnin warned then that the pullout would alter the nature of the international strategic balance freeing up countries to restart arms buildups both conventional and nuclear as it happened he couldn t have been more on the mark the u s is now engaged in a 30 year trillion dollar plus remake and update of its nuclear arsenal while the russians whose present inventory of 6 500 nuclear weapons slightly exceeds america s have gone down a similar route in that televised address of his on the eve of the 2018 russian presidential election putin s list of new nuclear weapons was headed by the sarmat a 30 ton intercontinental ballistic missile reputedly far harder for an enemy to intercept in its most vulnerable phase just after launching it also carries a larger number of nuclear warheads than its predecessor another new weapon on his list was a nuclear powered intercontinental underwater drone status 6 a submarine launched autonomous vehicle with a range of 6 800 miles capable of carrying a 100 megaton nuclear warhead and then there was his country s new nuclear powered cruise missile with a practically unlimited range in addition because of its stealth capabilities it will be hard to detect in flight and its high maneuverability will theoretically at least enable it to bypass an enemy s defenses successfully tested in 2018 it does not yet have a name unsurprisingly putin won the presidency with 77 percent of the vote a 13 percent rise from the previous poll on record voter turnout of 67 7 percent in conventional weaponry russia s s 400 missile system remains unrivalled according to the washington based arms control association the s 400 system is an advanced mobile surface to air defense system of radars and missiles of different ranges capable of destroying a variety of targets such as attack aircraft bombs and tactical ballistic missiles each battery normally consists of eight launchers 112 missiles and command and support vehicles the s 400 missile has a range of 400 kilometers 250 miles and its integrated system is believed to be capable of shooting down up to 80 targets simultaneously consider it a sign of the times but in defiance of pressure from the trump administration not to buy russian weaponry president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey the only muslim member of nato ordered the purchase of batteries of those very s 400 missiles turkish soldiers are currently being trained on that weapons systems in russia the first battery is expected to arrive in turkey next month similarly in april 2015 russia signed a contract to supply s 400 missiles to china the first delivery of the system took place in january 2018 and china test fired it in august expanding beijing moscow alliance consider that as another step in russian chinese military coordination meant to challenge washington s claim to be the planet s sole superpower similarly last september 3 500 chinese troops participated in russia s largest ever military exercises involving 300 000 soldiers 36 000 military vehicles 80 ships and 1 000 aircraft helicopters and drones codenamed vostok 2018 it took place across a vast region that included the bering sea the sea of okhotsk and the sea of japan little wonder that nato officials described vostok 2018 as a demonstration of a growing russian focus on future large scale conflict it fits into a pattern we have seen over some time a more assertive russia significantly increasing its defense budget and its military presence putin attended the exercises after hosting an economic forum in vladivostok where chinese president xi was his guest we have trustworthy ties in political security and defense spheres he declared while xi praised the two countries friendship which he claimed was getting stronger all the time thanks to climate change russia and china are now also working in tandem in the fast melting arctic last year russia which controls more than half the arctic coastline sent its first ship through the northern sea route without an icebreaker in winter putin hailed that moment as a big event in the opening up of the arctic beijing s arctic policy first laid out in january 2018 described china as a near arctic state and visualized the future shipping routes there as part of a potential new polar silk road that would both be useful for resource exploitation and for enhancing chinese security shipping goods to and from europe by such a passage would shorten the distance to china by 30 percent compared to present sea routes through the malacca straits and the suez canal saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per voyage according to the u s geological survey the arctic holds petroleum reserves equal to 412 billion barrels of oil or about 22 percent of the world s undiscovered hydrocarbons it also has deposits of rare earth metals china s second arctic vessel xuelong 2 snow dragon 2 is scheduled to make its maiden voyage later this year russia needs chinese investment to extract the natural resources under its permafrost in fact china is already the biggest foreign investor in russia s liquefied natural gas lng projects in the region and the first lng shipment was dispatched to china s eastern province last summer via the northern sea route its giant oil corporation is now beginning to drill for gas in russian waters alongside the russian company gazprom washington is rattled in april in its latest annual report to congress on china s military power the pentagon for the first time included a section on the arctic warning of the risks of a growing chinese presence in the region including that country s possible deployment of nuclear submarines there in the future in may secretary of state mike pompeo used a meeting of foreign ministers in rovaniemi finland to assail china for its aggressive behavior in the arctic in an earlier speech pompeo noted that from 2012 to 2017 china invested nearly 90 billion in the arctic region we re concerned about russia s claim over the international waters of the northern sea route including its newly announced plans to connect it with china s maritime silk road he said he then pointed out that along that route moscow already illegally demands other nations request permission to pass requires russian maritime pilots to be aboard foreign ships and threatens to use military force to sink any that fail to comply with their demands american downturn continues altogether the tightening military and economic ties between russia and china have put america on the defensive contrary to trump s maga promise to american voters in the 2016 campaign it s true that despite fraying diplomatic and economic ties between washington and moscow trump s personal relations with putin remain cordial the two periodically exchange friendly phone calls but among russians more generally a favorable view of the u s fell from 41 percent in 2017 to 26 percent in 2018 according to a pew research survey there s nothing new about great powers even the one that proclaimed itself the greatest in history declining after having risen high in our acrimonious times that s a reality well worth noting while launching his bid for reelection recently trump proposed a bombastic new slogan keep america great or kag as if he had indeed raised america s stature while in office he would have been far more on target however had he suggested the slogan depress america more or dam to reflect the reality of an unpopular president who faces rising great power rivals abroad dilip hiro a tomdispatch regular

menafn baystreet ca last week saw japan s mitsui and japan oil gas and metals national corporation agree to buy a 10 stake in novatek s arctic lng liquefied natural gas 2 project for an officially undisclosed price although russia s president vladimir putin independently stated that the investment would be around us 3 billion the fact that putin himself commented on the deal underlines how important the exploration and development of the arctic region is for the russian state as a source of potentially vast new oil and gas resources and the accretion of further geopolitical influence akin to the game changing shale industry for the u s russia s current development of the arctic region is centred around the yamal peninsula and led principally novatek but further developments are in the offing from gazprom and gazprom neft even in the face of current and future u s sanctions novatek s main arctic project the yamal lng unofficially referred to as arctic 1 last week announced that it produced 9 0 million tons of lng and 0 6 million tons of stable gas condensate in the first half of this year with all three lng trains running above the 5 5 million tons per annum mtpa nameplate capacity over that period this resulted in 126 lng tanker shipments being dispatched in the six month period via trans shipment from the ice class lng carriers to conventional vessels in norway and delivered onto the global markets mostly to russia s key target markets in asia overall the yamal lng project consists of a 17 4 mtpa natural gas liquefaction plant comprised of three lng trains of 5 5 mtpa each and one lng train of 900 thousand tons per annum utilising the hydrocarbon resources of the south tambeyskoye field in the russian arctic novatek is the exception in terms of global lng companies in that it has always been very accurate in terms of delivering its projects on time and on budget as it is a very western style operation run by a very capable ceo leonid mikhleson andrey polischuk senior oil and gas analyst from raiffeisenbank in moscow told oilprice com last week additionally supportive of success for further developments is that the arctic is an absolute priority for the government aimed at bringing russia s lng standing in the world market into line with its status as a global gas superpower as its lng capability has always been way behind what its gas production power would warrant he said in this context u s sanctions imposed after russia took over crimea in 2014 only made putin more determined that the arctic lng program would not fail moscow not only initially bankrolled yamal lng from the beginning with money directly from the state budget but also later in 2014 supported it again by selling bonds in yamal lng the program began on 24 november 2015 with a rub75 billion 15 year issue it further provided rub150 billion of additional backstop funding from the national welfare fund after that and months of wrangling april 2016 saw two chinese state banks agree to provide us 12 billion to the yamal lng project in euros and roubles the project was helped by a tumble in the rouble in late 2014 that effectively cut the cost of russia sourced equipment and labour at a key moment in the construction having insulated itself from u s financial sanctions novatek is busy doing the same for its technology requirements novatek has already indigenised as much of the technology and machinery involved with the yamal lng project as it can and last year received a federal patent for its arctic cascade natural gas liquefaction technology this is based on a two stage liquefaction process that capitalises on the colder ambient temperature in the arctic climate to maximise energy efficiency during the liquefaction process and is the first patented liquefaction technology using equipment produced only by russian manufacturers the overall goal of novatek as the company itself has stated more than once is to localise the fabrication and construction of lng trains and modules to decrease the overall cost of liquefaction and develop a technological base within russia so that the arctic lng operations are not subject to the whims of other countries and future sanctions given this backdrop novatek s second yamal lng project officially arctic lng 2 aims for three lng trains of 6 6 mtpa each based around the oil and gas resources of the utrenneye field which has at least 1 138 billion cubic metres of natural gas and 57 million tons of liquids in reserves novatek plans to commission the first train in 2023 the second train in 2024 and the third train in 2025 before reaching full capacity in 2026 to this end it has already secured three other partners in the venture aside from the japanese two are from the key target market of china itself the china national petroleum corporation subsidiary china national oil and gas exploration and development and china national offshore oil corporation with a joint 10 stake and france s supermajor total also with 10 novatek has said that it plans to keep 60 for itself with the remaining 10 likely to go shortly to saudi aramco oilprice com understands form various russia analysts novatek will make the final investment decision on the project in the third quarter of this year in the same vein russian gas giant gazprom recently announced the full scale development of the giant kharasavey gas field in the bovanenkovo production zone on the northern yamal peninsula this is part of the company s continuing shift in its production base northward in line with russia s other major tangential strategy of building out the gas capacity of yamal to compensate for reserves depletion in west siberia kharasavey is estimated to hold 2 trillion cubic metres of gas and is set to produce first gas in 2023 with plateau output of 32 billion cubic metres per year given the outlook for gas demand in the key markets of europe and asia and the geopolitical ramifications of being the major gas supplier to these regions gazprom s oil producing subsidiary gazprom neft is also looking at producing its own lng from its arctic operations monetising its gas resources in the arctic would be a relatively straightforward task for gazprom neft allowing the company to recoup more of the rub400 billion us 6 4 billion that it plans to spend on developing its novoportovskoye field estimated to have recoverable reserves of more than 320 bcm of gas over the next five years earlier than would otherwise be the case part of this development cost is planned to go on the construction of a key gas pipeline to run from novy port across the gulf of ob to yamburg which will carry at least 10 billion cubic metres of gas per year from the novoportovskoye oil and gas field into gazprom s main gas delivery system this infrastructure is also likely to be utilised by the third of novatek s own arctic projects ob lng which commenced development in june based on the resources of the verkhnetiuteyskoye and zapadno seyakhinskoye fields located in the central part of the yamal peninsula the two fields hold a total of 157 billion cubic metres of natural gas and the projected new plant will produce up to 4 8 mtpa of lng the main plant built exclusively with russian made technology in sabetta will cost us 5 billion and is set to come into operation in 2023 that a key point in adding such production from this the arctic region is to dominate the asian markets particularly that of china was tacitly acknowledged by novatek s mikhelson recently when he stated that he expected at least 80 of novatek s future lng production to go to the asian market this was further highlighted by the fact that novatek is moving forward with the trans shipment lng facility on the russian far east coast in kamchatka anna belova senior russia and fsu oil and gas analyst for globaldata in new york told oilprice com even more tellingly perhaps mikhelson added that future sales to china

to think about it if they do create difficulties for our russian banks the all we have to do is replace dollars he said the trade war between the u s and china will only accelerate the process he added such a strategy was tested in 2014 when gazprom neft tried trading cargoes of crude oil in chinese yuan and rubles with china and europe this idea of an alternate principal trading currency for

washington pointing to a weaker global economy rising trade tensions and chronically low inflation chairman jerome powell signaled today that the federal reserve is likely to cut interest rates late this month for the first time in a decade delivering the central bank s semiannual report to congress powell said that since fed officials met last month uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook in addition inflation has dipped further below the fed s annual target level the chairman s remarks led investors to send stock prices up bond yields down and the value of the u s dollar lower on expectations of lower interest rates the s p 500 index briefly traded over 3 000 for the first time testifying to the house financial services committee powell was asked as he has been before what he would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence that he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion that he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms that he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude that a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a likely rate cut late this month as an insurance policy against an economic downturn i think it will be the start of a series of rate cuts added sung won sohn economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles powell wants to provide fuel for the economy down the road expectations of a pending rate cut drew additional support today when the fed released the minutes of its june 18 19 meeting the central bank held rates unchanged then but the minutes showed that some officials felt looser credit could soon be needed to address economic weakness investors have collectively put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 after it raised rates four times last year action that incited the initial attacks on the powell fed from trump in the prepared remarks he delivered today before taking questions from the house members powell made no mention of the president s criticism he did thank congress for the independence it has given the fed to operate free of political intrusion but later in the question and answer period several democratic committee members offered support for powell s leadership and a rejection of trump s criticism rep maxine waters who leads the committee declared that this president has made it clear that he has no understanding or respect for the independence of the federal reserve waters and other democrats urged powell to stand up to trump s attacks have no fear rep david scott d ga told the chairman we in congress both democrats and republicans have got your back powell s remarks today began two days of his testimony on capitol hill on thursday he will address the senate banking committee at the moment the u s economic landscape is a mixed one the job market appears resilient but economic growth is slowing many forecasters predict that growth has slowed to an annual rate of around 2 in the just completed april june quarter in his testimony powell said the economy has fared reasonably well over the first half of the year but he noted that crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook he said that growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably possibly because of concerns over slowing global growth and the trade battle between the trump administration and china the fed chairman told the house committee that he thinks average worker pay isn t rising fast enough to accelerate low inflation even with the unemployment rate near a five decade low an absence of inflation pressure makes it easier for the fed to cut short term rates referring to rates powell repeated a pledge the fed made in its june policy statement that officials would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion but notably he added that many fed official saw that the case for a looser monetary policy had strengthened the fed hasn t cut rates since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis trump and chinese president xi jinping declared a truce last month in what had threatened to become an escalating u s china trade war and agreed to resume talks toward a deal that would meet the administration s demands to better protect u s technology that step eased fears that trump would extend punitive tariffs to an additional 300 billion in chinese goods in the process inviting retaliation from beijing on american exports and likely weakening both nations economies and last week the government reported that after a tepid job gain in may u s employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june an indication of the economy s durability

annual target level the chairman s remarks led investors to send stock prices up bond yields down and the value of the u s dollar lower on expectations of lower interest rates the s p 500 index briefly traded over 3 000 for the first time testifying to the house financial services committee powell was asked as he has been before what he would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence that he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion that he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms that he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude that a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a likely rate cut late this month as an insurance policy against an economic downturn i think it will be the start of a series of rate cuts added sung won sohn economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles powell wants to provide fuel for the economy down the road expectations of a pending rate cut drew additional support wednesday when the fed released the minutes of its june 18 19 meeting the central bank held rates unchanged then but the minutes showed that some officials felt looser credit could soon be needed to address economic weakness investors have collectively put the odds of a rate cut this month at 100 the fed s benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 after it raised rates four times last year action that incited the initial attacks on the powell fed from trump in the prepared remarks he delivered wednesday before taking questions from the house members powell made no mention of the president s criticism he did thank congress for the independence it has given the fed to operate free of political intrusion but later in the question and answer period several democratic committee members offered support for powell s leadership and a rejection of trump s criticism rep maxine waters who leads the committee declared that this president has made it clear that he has no understanding or respect for the independence of the federal reserve waters and other democrats urged powell to stand up to trump s attacks have no fear rep david scott d ga told the chairman we in congress both democrats and republicans have got your back powell s remarks wednesday began two days of his testimony on capitol hill on thursday he will address the senate banking committee at the moment the u s economic landscape is a mixed one the job market appears resilient but economic growth is slowing many forecasters predict that growth has slowed to an annual rate of around 2 in the just completed april june quarter in his testimony powell said the economy has fared reasonably well over the first half of the year but he noted that crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook he said that growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably possibly because of concerns over slowing global growth and the trade battle between the trump administration and china the fed chairman told the house committee that he thinks average worker pay isn t rising fast enough to accelerate low inflation even with the unemployment rate near a five decade low an absence of inflation pressure makes it easier for the fed to cut short term rates referring to rates powell repeated a pledge the fed made in its june policy statement that officials would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion but notably he added that many fed official saw that the case for a looser monetary policy had strengthened the fed hasn t cut rates since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis trump and chinese president xi jinping declared a truce last month in what had threatened to become an escalating u s china trade war and agreed to resume talks toward a deal that would meet the administration s demands to better protect u s technology that step eased fears that trump would extend punitive tariffs to an additional 300 billion in chinese goods in the process inviting retaliation from beijing on american exports and likely weakening both nations economies and last week the government reported that after a tepid job gain in may u s employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june an indication of the economy s durability

debt crisis that wrought financial chaos and wrecked livelihoods in his country decades later he must boost investor confidence in a shrinking economy buffeted by what his predecessor and mentor carlos urzua called extremism that led him to resign on tuesday with a strongly worded letter advertisement advertisement president andres manuel lopez obrador on tuesday named former world bank executive and long time ally herrera to succeed urzua urzua who was seen as a moderate policymaker and disciplined manager of public finances blamed meddling in the finance ministry and ill thought out economic policies for his abrupt resignation it fueled concerns in mexico and among investors around the world of disarray in the government in his first meeting with the media on tuesday herrera said he had the support of urzua who he described as my mentor my teacher my leader a straight talker herrera is well regarded among investors who have become accustomed to seeing him at high profile events representing latin america s second largest economy he had already been put in charge of policies close to the president s heart such as bringing banking to more people advertisement advertisement mexico was rich in resources but is a country with a lot of poverty he told reuters in an interview shortly after he was named deputy finance minister last year he spoke of the importance of focusing on growth without spurring the runaway inflation and currency crises that stunted mexico in the 1980s and 1990s themes he referred back to after assuming his new role his task will not be easy he takes over as finance minister after the economy contracted in the first quarter with economists warning of a looming recession investors are increasingly concerned that lopez obrador will drive through his favorite development projects regardless of what the finance ministry says advertisement advertisement the one calling the shots is andres manuel lopez obrador said ricardo adrogue head of barings global sovereign debt and currencies group urzua did not elaborate on what policy steps led him to resign but decisions by lopez obrador to cancel a partially built 13 billion airport designate scarce funds to a new oil refinery and forcefully renegotiate gas pipeline contracts with canadian and u s companies have all led to market volatility herrera now faces a balancing act of meeting a 1 primary budget surplus target that has helped offset market worries about government policies and kept the peso broadly stable while reviving the growth that lopez obrador on tuesday said was his priority to achieve that herrera must spur private investment and fend off downgrades from ratings agencies worried about indebted state oil company pemex he must also handle the frictions with others in the government alluded to by urzua in his letter advertisement advertisement herrera has been the face of mexico s finance ministry in meetings with international investors in recent months and is a credible choice said abbas ameli renani an emerging markets portfolio manager at amundi but the outgoing finance minister s resignation letter confirms the waning

download pdf download pdf bennett jones spring 2019 economic outlook written by david a dodge richard dion serge dupont john m weekes michael horgan and valerie hughes after a strong performance in 2017 and the first half of 2018 the global economy slowed markedly and is projected to grow at a more moderate but also more sustainable annual rate of 3 3 from 2019 to 2021 in section i we discuss our projections and the risks that need to be considered we turn to a discussion of international trade developments and prospects in section ii including the issues facing the world trade organization wto and canada building on the global economic and trade outlook we set out the outlook for canada over the next three years in section iii in section iv we return to the analysis of the fiscal position of canada and the four largest provinces taking into account the evolving economic outlook and policies announced in 2019 budgets as usual we conclude with a summary of planning parameters for canadian business over the 2019 to 2021 horizon section i global growth to 2021 recent developments after a very strong performance in 2017 and the first half of 2018 the world economy experienced a marked slowdown in the second half of 2018 data indicates that growth has picked up in the first quarter of 2019 at least in advanced economies both advanced economies and china lost growth momentum in the second half of 2018 in china quarterly growth at an annual rate continued to decelerate slightly in the first quarter to below 6 0 although on a year on year basis growth remained at 6 4 consistent with the official growth target by contrast growth in advanced economies picked up to an unanticipated extent in the first quarter notably in the united states the euro area japan and great britain the buoyant 3 1 growth rate recorded in the united states however rests on a surge in net exports and business inventories which in all likelihood will be soon reversed growth in consumer spending and non residential fixed investment on the other hand was much slower than in preceding quarters the fading effect of the u s fiscal stimulus of 2018 trade policy disputes and the related uncertainty for businesses and government policies are two factors that have weighed on global growth in recent quarters policy adjusted somewhat to the softer momentum of activity that became apparent in the latter part of 2018 the chinese authorities have implemented modest fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in recent months in light of recorded slower growth persistently subdued inflation and considerable trade uncertainty monetary policy in large advanced economies has lately shifted perhaps temporarily toward a more patient stance regarding the normalization of interest rates the federal reserve has refrained from raising its interest rate after the december 2018 hike of 25 basis points and in march signaled a pause in its interest rate increases for the remainder of 2019 this signal was only a guide however as monetary policy remains data dependent i e subject to change in light of new data revised forecasts and changing risks likewise the european central bank ecb announced in march that it further postponed a rise in interest rates to at least the end of this year as investors reassessed the impact of trade uncertainty u s bond yields dropped excluding volatile elements inflation in advanced economies has been stable or declining during the first quarter in the u s core consumption expenditure pce inflation was stable at 1 6 in the february to april period after declining from 2 0 in december 2018 moreover hourly earnings in the u s grew at an average annualized rate of only 2 6 in the first four months of 2019 despite unemployment rates at 4 0 or less since the spring of 2018 as at march 2019 core consumer price index cpi was 0 8 in the euro area and 0 3 in japan west texas intermediate wti oil prices have been very volatile since late october 2018 falling from a relatively stable us 70 in the may october period to about us 45 at the end of 2018 before rising to nearly us 65 by mid april 2019 and then receding to below us 60 by the end of may the initial fall in prices mostly reflected u s waivers on imports of iranian oil and a large increase in global production notably shale oil in the united states but it also reflected weakening global growth toward the end of the year the subsequent recovery stemmed from production cuts by organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and non opec countries and from unplanned outages e g russian pipeline to europe meanwhile the price discount to wti on western canada select oil has shrunk from a record us 50 in october 2018 to a more normal us 15 in may 2019 contributing to this reduced discount were production cuts totaling 325 000 barrels a day mandated by the alberta government in january due to be curtailed to 175 000 barrels a day in june and 95 000 barrels a day by december global economic outlook we continue to believe that businesses should base their plans on projected 3 3 annual global growth over the next three years i e growth near potential but somewhat weaker than the above potential growth of 3 7 in both 2017 and 2018 in china further rebalancing of the economy and trade restrictions and uncertainties would slow growth but only gradually overall as easing of fiscal and monetary policies would provide an offset in the united states the fading impetus of the end of 2017 tax and fiscal stimulus combined with trade restrictions and uncertainties would contribute to reduce the unsustainably high growth rates of 2017 and 2018 to the potential rate monetary policy should remain accommodative table 1 1 short term prospects for output growth 2018 world output share 2 2018 2019 2020 2021 canada 1 4 1 8 1 3 2 0 1 9 1 8 1 9 1 7 united states 15 2 2 9 2 5 2 5 1 9 1 8 1 8 1 8 euro area 11 4 1 8

area and japan 2shares of world output are on a purchasing power parity basis much as in our bennett jones fall 2018 outlook we project the world economy to grow at about its potential rate of 3 3 over the next three years table 1 1 this is significantly slower than the 3 7 pace recorded in 2017 and 2018 when advanced economies were growing faster than potential and economic slack was rapidly absorbed the projected slowdown largely originates in the advanced economies which now operate at or near capacity and to a lesser extent in china going forward potential growth in the advanced economies is expected to be held back by a continuation of the modest labour productivity growth experienced in the last several years and by the negative impact of population aging on labour force growth 1 meanwhile aggregate demand growth in the advanced economies will be driven down to its lower potential rate primarily due to the run off of the effects of the 2018 u s fiscal policy stimulus and the negative effects of past normalization of u s monetary policy and past appreciation of the u s dollar while there will be some drag exerted in the short run by u s and chinese tariff increases through their effects on trade and domestic demand we look through these short run effects and assume that there will be no major ongoing disruptions to global trade volumes the global slowing nevertheless will likely be accentuated by ongoing political issues in europe we do not think that the known global economic and financial headwinds are sufficiently severe in and of themselves to cause a recession in advanced economies over the next couple of years in china expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are likely to be used to support domestic growth with positive spillovers on global growth and commodity prices central banks in advanced economies have indicated they will show flexibility in the path to normalization as long as economic prospects remain highly uncertain and inflation subdued moreover fiscal policy is likely to move in a more expansionary direction in some advanced economies providing further offset to trade and other headwinds as in our previous outlooks we assume that the wti oil price will fluctuate around us 60 65 per barrel in the short term for planning purposes we think it is useful to assume that world oil supply will adjust to changes in demand over time so as to keep prices a little over us 60 on average however we anticipate much volatility around that level in reaction to industry news geopolitical developments revised economic forecasts and delayed adjustment of oil supply to changes in demand regarding other commodity prices taken as a whole we adhere to the international monetary fund imf view of a subdued outlook in the short term the u s china trade dispute has intensified lately on may 10 the u s administration increased the 10 0 tariff on 200 billion worth of imports from china to 25 0 and signaled its intent to impose a 25 0 tariff on all remaining u s imports from china about 300 billion china retaliated by announcing it would raise tariffs up to 25 0 for most of the goods on its 60 billion list starting june 1 2019 as a first approximation these tariff increases if maintained might reduce the level of real u s gdp by 0 3 0 4 by the end of 2020 these effects are already incorporated in our outlook the impact on china s gdp is estimated to be larger than on the u s gdp we have not incorporated the impact of any further trade actions in our projection and make no allowance either for the deleterious effects of these further actions on business and consumer confidence or for any offsetting easing in monetary or fiscal policy in reaction to these actions our projection assumes that the united states and china will conclude some form of agreement before the u s presidential election without in the meantime triggering a full blown trade war their economies will be impacted in the next several quarters by the effects of the implemented tariff increases but as discussed below macro policies will provide an offset and smooth the path toward potential growth by late 2020 besides the u s china trade dispute the u s administration has threatened to impose a 25 0 tariff on imported cars and parts from the european union eu and japan on national security grounds in may president trump decided to wait up to six months before determining to impose such a tariff which would have material consequences not only for the eu and japan but also for the united states our projection is based on our view that this tariff is unlikely to be applied in the future similarly we assume that the u s will not actually implement mr trump s recent threat to raise tariffs on mexico in response to the migration issue u s growth is projected to decelerate from an unsustainable 2 9 rate in 2018 to 2 5 in 2019 1 9 in 2020 and 1 8 in 2021 growth in aggregate demand falls to its potential rate of about 1 8 as the economy adjusts to i the negative impact of increased trade barriers through trade investment and cost increases ii a run off of the effect of the recent fiscal stimulus iii past increases in interest rates and iv past appreciation of the u s dollar exports non residential business investment and household consumption should all contribute to the slowdown in the remainder of 2019 inventory investment is likely to decline and dampen growth u s price inflation has remained surprisingly tame so far in 2019 in the face of a very tight labour market and earlier tariff increases on imports from china a development that the federal reserve attributes at least in part to temporary factors while we still subscribe to the federal reserve s view that inflationary pressures will soon materialize we expect that u s inflation will remain contained in the short term as the economy decelerates markedly and inflation expectations centered on the 2 0 target hold firm barring the implementation of the further tariff increases currently contemplated by the u s administration cost push inflation from tariff increases should also remain limited thus a burst of inflation has a low probability of occurring later in 2019 correspondingly we attach a low probability to a rise of more than 25 or 50 basis points in the u s policy interest rate over the projection horizon the recent escalation of the trade dispute with china and persisting subdued inflation leave little room for interest rate increases in 2019 whereas we anticipated a 100 basis points increase in our fall outlook in contrast with the recent prevailing view reflected in financial markets however we do not expect that the federal reserve will significantly reduce its policy rate as the unemployment rate is expected to remain low and growth to remain above or at potential going forward for planning purposes businesses should assume a very modest increase in treasury bond rates by 2021 euro area growth is projected to fall from 1 8 in 2018 to 1 3 in 2019 and 1 5 in 2020 and 2021 weighing on euro area growth going forward are slower global demand growth low confidence as well as political uncertainty as some of the headwinds created by brexit fiscal challenges in italy and protests in france should continue to hamper activity nevertheless our projection cannot rule out a no deal brexit which would have a negative effect on eu growth in the short term on the other hand the negative impact of changes in emissions regulation in the car industry in 2018 will disappear more importantly the euro economy is likely to get support from fiscal easing in germany and perhaps also france in reaction to gilets jaunes from still high growth of demand in china and from an accommodating monetary policy from the ecb last march the ecb signaled a shift toward more expansionary policy by announcing that policy rates would remain unchanged at least until the end of 2019 instead of mid year and that the expiring targeted longer term refinancing operations would be replaced by new ones later in 2019 our projection for japan calls for growth rates of 0 7 in 2019 and 0 5 in 2020 and 2021 this is similar on average to our fall outlook reflecting the offsetting influences of more trade related weakness in 2019 and the positive impact of new fiscal measures to mitigate the effect in 2020 of the planned consumption tax rate increase in october 2019 as in our fall outlook we project growth in china to fall from 6 6 in 2018 to 6 2 in 2019 6 0 in 2020 and 5 8 in 2021 this gradual slowing reflects a natural downward adjustment as the structure of the economy shifts in support of consumption and housing led growth and away from investment and exports led growth tariff increases by the united states have become more severe since last fall but chinese authorities have eased both fiscal and monetary policies to counteract the loss of momentum in the economy they have the capacity and have expressed their willingness to support economic growth in the face of headwinds going forward even if this raises already high debt levels and hampers the rebalancing of the economy as a result projected growth decelerates at a measured pace over the next three years although in 2019 the slowing is more rapid as the effect of u s tariff increases are increasingly felt we expect slowing growth in china and large advanced economies and flat or declining real commodity prices to hold back growth in the rest of the world country specific factors also importantly shape growth turkey and argentina for instance should experience a contraction of activity in 2019 but rebound in 2020 india should see an acceleration of growth in the next two years especially in view of the results of the latest national election growth in brazil is expected to pick up markedly from the low rates experienced in 2017 and 2018 on balance growth in the rest of the world slows in 2019 but settles at a higher pace in 2020 and 2021 risks to the global outlook we see three possible upside risks to our projection first growth in china could be somewhat stronger than we envisage if authorities show more readiness than we expect in keeping growth at or close to their official target of 6 5 instead of letting it drift lower this would have positive spillovers on global growth and commodity prices second we see the risk of a burst of inflation in 2019 as low and therefore the risk of a significant escalation of u s interest rates as equally low in fact u s inflation may remain significantly below target instead of eventually responding to demand pressures and cost increases as we expect in our projection this could incite the federal reserve to reverse monetary policy normalization thereby providing more support to growth third discretionary u s fiscal policy may turn expansionary in advance of the presidential election in 2020 and keep growth above instead of at potential for a short while there are four specific downside risks to our short term outlook that we want to flag besides geopolitical risks related to arab countries russia or asia the korean peninsula and south china seas the first and biggest downside risk is that the u s china trade dispute degenerates into a full blown trade war the hit to global growth would be considerable especially to the extent that uncertainty soars confidence plummets and a major sell off in markets tightens financial conditions in addition there remains the risk that the u s administration may decide to actually impose a 25 0 tariff on imported cars and parts from the european union and japan at the end of the current six month grace period this would have a material effect on the three economies second there is a risk that the united states will carry out trump s threat to place a tariff on imports from mexico if mexico does not take action to restrain migration to the united states third a no deal brexit may well emerge instead of a soft brexit as assumed this would disrupt supply chains and raise trade costs with potentially large and persistent negative impacts on the u k and eu economies finally it is hard to judge how far a conflict between the u s and iran could go beyond the recent u s decision to end import waivers for iranian oil the risk of a temporary escalation of world oil prices and consequent negative effect on global growth in the short term cannot be ruled out section ii international trade overview the overall situation in international trade remains similar to what we described in our bennett jones fall 2018 economic outlook uncertainty continues to be the most apt description of what we see however there have been a few positive developments which are described in our report at the global level the scene is dominated by the u s china trade frictions which have intensified in recent weeks efforts continue between these two countries to resolve their differences however any honest appraisal needs to recognize that this trade feud is part of a larger strategic struggle over which country will be the dominant power in the 21st century there may be a temporary respite in the trade spat but it almost certainly will not resolve the larger issue and tensions will remain at an elevated level for a considerable period of time indeed there are signs that the trump administration may be doubling down on dealing with china by removing irritants with key allies the decision by president trump to delay for six months a final determination on whether to apply duties on automobile imports into the united states for alleged national security reasons under section 232 will take some of the heat out of u s eu and u s japan relations similarly the agreement with canada and mexico to terminate the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum improves u s relations with its two north american partners the canada united states mexico agreement cusma 2 the president s signature trade policy success awaits action by congress there is a lack of enthusiasm for the agreement but both democrats and republicans have been careful to leave the door open to eventual ratification for the administration securing ratification of this agreement is critical in testimony in february to the ways and means committee of the house of representatives ustr lighthizer said there is no trade program in the united states if we don t pass the meanwhile push back in congress and the country to the president s aggressive trade policy continues to build as it becomes apparent that president trump s march 2018 tweet that trade wars are good and easy to win is not an accurate reflection of reality perhaps we are witnessing an evolution in u s trade policy to prioritize objectives and to try actually working with partners the president s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership agreement tpp and the lack of progress in engaging in free trade negotiations with the eu means american exporters are suffering from self inflicted least favoured nation treatment ambassador lighthizer has now engaged in free trade negotiations with japan but following president trump s trip to japan it is now clear a deal cannot be concluded before august at the earliest time is running out for the administration to conclude major trade agreements before the 2020 election particularly with an agenda which already includes getting the united states mexico canada agreement usmca through congress and striking a trade deal with china it should also be noted that the trade promotion authority by which congress delegated authority to the president to negotiate trade agreements expires on july 1 2021 just five months after the next presidential inauguration this picture is deeply worrying for world class american businesses including agricultural producers who are prominent in trump s base at the wto the united states continues to maintain its refusal to consider the appointment of new members to the wto appellate body but their overall approach in the wto appears less strident than a year ago the united states recently scored a major victory in the wto when a panel ruled that chinese domestic support for wheat and rice exceeded what china is allowed to do by nearly 100 billion per year 3 the panel report was subsequently adopted by the wto dispute settlement body when neither side appealed the ruling to the appellate body in january 76 wto members announced their intention to commence wto negotiations on trade related aspects of electronic commerce 4 there is growing evidence that many wto members are interested in making progress on wto reform jim carr minister of international trade diversification convened the third ministerial meeting of the ottawa group on wto reform in the week of may 20 on the margins of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd ministerial council meeting in paris on may 13 and 14 in new delhi india convened a meeting of ministers from 16 developing and 6 least developed countries to discuss wto reform issues china has announced its intention to host a similar conference in the fall of 2019 in china and has circulated a paper on wto reform the last time there was such ministerial involvement in discussing multilateral trade issues was in the 1980s in the years preceding the launch of the uruguay round of general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt negotiations which led to the formation of the wto a strong wto is of great importance to canada because it establishes an international body of rules that provides and usually ensures equal treatment for small medium and large countries without the wto and with major powers focused on managing their own problems canada would be faced with a very uncertain trading environment it is in canada s national interest to work with other small and medium sized countries to contribute to a revitalization of the wto if the wto unraveled we would find out quickly just how important it is for canadian interests there are many rules such as those dealing with anti dumping countervailing duties and subsidies that are only dealt with at the wto all the bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements are grounded in the foundations of the wto furthermore wto dispute settlement has been vital in protecting canadian rights in a way that bilateral dispute settlement arrangements never have for canada stabilizing trade relations within north america remains job one the fate of cusma lies in the hands of the american congress because the prospects for ratification are much greater in canada and mexico the agreement announced on may 17 to remove american duties on steel and aluminum imports from canada and mexico creates a more positive environment in all three countries for considering the ratification of the cusma the second most important thing for canada is to take advantage of the preferential access we now enjoy as a result of the coming into force of the comprehensive and progressive agreement on trans pacific partnership cptpp and the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta with the eu with the americans having counted themselves out this is a once in a century opportunity to make inroads into these markets and to consolidate our position third we need to take stock of our relationship with china and how best to manage it going forward clearly that will not be easy as recent history has demonstrated we need to conduct a hard nosed assessment of the challenges in china and it should start with an appraisal of chinese economic fundamentals that needs to underpin the subsequent policy analysis overall we believe that canada has already negotiated trade agreements that provide major opportunities for canadian business and producers the government should now concentrate its resources on helping the private sector take advantage of these opportunities rather than pursue the negotiation of additional trade agreements with countries whose markets offer relatively fewer opportunities trump s trade policy in year three donald trump boasts of the successes of his america first trade policy but it is hard to see where there are any real gains unless the real objective is decoupling of the u s and chinese economies and simultaneously isolating the united states from its traditional trade partners his biggest success is the renegotiation of the nafta but that cannot be chalked up as a victory until he secures congressional approval of course he can also tout the tweaking of the trade agreement with south korea as a success but that hardly constitutes a remaking of the american trade relationship with the world his approach to rebalancing the relationship with china is not going well the threats continue as trump s tweets make clear on may 5 he tweeted for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25 on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10 on 200 billion dollars of other goods these payments are partially responsible for our great economic results the 10 will go up to 25 on friday 325 billions dollars of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25 the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no this approach would effectively penalize all of china s exports to the united states and has already incurred retaliation from china president trump has noted that in a tariff war the united states has more ammunition because they have a large trade deficit with china however there are other economic retaliatory tools the chinese government can use including tightening the screws on american companies operating in china through the use of various regulatory measures making it harder for american businesspeople to travel to china reducing trade barriers and other restrictions for non american companies and investors to weaken the competitive position of american firms in the chinese market place and encouraging the chinese people to boycott american products on may 15 president donald trump signed the executive order on securing the information and communications technology and services supply chain 5 the order finds that foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services it authorizes u s government agencies to take a wide range of actions to thwart this threat the order makes it very difficult for huawei to conduct business with any u s entity this action may encourage the chinese to think of other ways to hit back american tariffs on steel and aluminum have resulted in a self inflicted injury rather than a rejuvenation of the american economy the promised bilateral agreements with countries like japan after withdrawal from the tpp have yet to be realized a free trade agreement with the eu seems a long distance off if this situation is successful do not tell the beleaguered farmers and other producers suffering from higher import costs and reduced export opportunities in section i of this outlook we consider the effect of the u s china trade dispute on gdp in the united states and china our estimates are that the effect would be in the order of 0 3 to 0 8 of gdp in the united states depending on how far trump goes in imposing more tariffs however the effects will not be spread evenly with for instance farmers in trump s base being impacted much more significantly world trade organization amidst significant trade tensions and very challenging times for global trade there is reason for muted optimism about the wto and the rules based trading system that it promotes this is because wto members are actively pursuing a wto reform agenda so that the organization will be better placed to respond to the world economy as it undergoes a technological transformation members have also agreed to commence negotiations on trade related aspects of electronic commerce an increasingly important aspect of today s economy but until now a subject area on which members could not agree to focus attention finally although the deadlock in appointing new judges to the wto appellate body has not been resolved members continue to rely regularly on the wto dispute settlement mechanism to resolve trade disputes a testament to the continuing confidence members have that the mechanism is capable of providing fair and impartial resolutions to serious trade irritants wto reform agenda the wto has embarked on a critical reform agenda as it approaches its 25th anniversary next year there is no single impetus for this reform movement several factors likely contributed these include technological advances that are revolutionizing the way we trade wto rules must be updated to address new areas such as digital trade in addition perceptions that wto rules are inadequate to resolve recent trade tensions between the united states and china have prompted some members to work on crafting new disciplines on non market oriented policies and practices wto negotiations on eliminating harmful fisheries subsidies that lead to overcapacity and overfishing set to conclude at the end of this year respond at least in part to the united nations un sustainable development goals finally the united states continued refusal to permit appointments to the wto appellate body has frustrated a number of wto members but it has also led several of them to propose amendments to the system with a view to responding to what they consider are legitimate u s concerns as reported in our fall economic update canadian minister for international trade diversification jim carr established what has become known as the ottawa group 13 wto members working to strengthen and modernize the wto following an inaugural meeting held in ottawa last october the group has met on two more occasions in january in davos and in may in paris the group s current focus is on improving the deliberative function of wto bodies australia brazil singapore and switzerland are leading reviews on four wto bodies the council for trade in services the sanitary and phytosanitary measures committee the technical barriers to trade committee and the rules of origin committee while norway is coordinating efforts on developing country issues as they affect wto reform reform efforts are also underway outside the ottawa group process as mentioned above india recently hosted an informal ministerial meeting attended by several developing country ministers and china will host a ministerial level meeting later this year the eu japan and the united states are collaborating to develop rules on state support of industries industrial subsidies and state owned enterprises several wto members have distributed papers outlining overall positions on reform for example canada china and the european union have each issued concept papers touching on several areas including on rule making procedures e g consensus multilateral plurilateral improving the capacity and opportunity for deliberation enhancing opportunities within wto committees to address specific trade concerns and mechanisms to take provisional remedies in cases of urgency fifty nine members counting the european union as 28 have contributed reform proposals touching on three main themes i procedures to strengthen notification requirements so that there is more transparency when members adopt subsidies domestic support and other measures ii development issues including the relevance of special and differential treatment in favour of developing members to promote development and whether the binary construct of developed versus developing status is outdated and undermines wto negotiations and iii the functioning of the appellate body addressing a variety of concerns raised by the united states during several meetings of the wto dispute settlement body including judicial overreach advisory opinions appellate body reports as precedent treatment of municipal law as fact and respect for timelines appellate body reform is the subject of most of the proposals this reflects the urgency to find a solution to the impasse on appointing judges to the appellate body to replace those whose terms have expired if no new appointments are made by december of this year the appellate body will not have the requisite three members to hear an appeal earlier this year no doubt in recognition of the importance of finding a resolution to the impasse the wto general council the highest level wto governing body composed of all 164 wto members appointed ambassador david walker of new zealand to facilitate discussions on appellate body reform wto reform is also receiving a lot of high level attention outside its corridors united nations secretary general antonio guterres addressed the organization on may 10 and underscored the importance of revitalizing multilateral trade cooperation and the need to buttress this unique institution that has safeguarded international trading relationships over the past 70 years 6 in december 2018 g 20 leaders observed that the wto system is currently falling short of its objectives and supported the necessary reform of the wto to improve its functioning 7 similarly the asia pacific economic cooperation apec ministers responsible for trade agreed in may 2019 that action is necessary to improve functioning 8 heightened activity on wto reform does not guarantee quick or certain results members perspectives on development issues for example are far apart and progress on appellate body reform is far from guaranteed however the fact that real and significant reform discussions are underway among wto members and that the un the g20 and apec support wto reform efforts illustrates what the wto director general recently described as a real shift in tone and a genuine opportunity to update the global trading system 9 this shift is a positive development for the wto and for the rules based trading system electronic commerce negotiations on trade related aspects of electronic commerce were launched earlier this year seventy seven wto members including canada the united states china japan eu australia brazil singapore russia and several developing countries are participating in the discussions issues raised include whether or not to continue a long standing moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions facilitation of e commerce transactions paperless trading and e payments discussions also address issues related to market access for goods and services data flows across borders protection of consumer and personal data digital security and the need to address the digital divide the canadian government sought input from interested stakeholders regarding these and other subjects that could form part of the discussions which will inform the development of its own position 10 although e commerce has long been on the wto agenda progress was blocked until december 2017 when 71 members announced a joint initiative to initiate exploratory work toward future negotiations talks are progressing and include written proposals from the united states eu including draft text and china positions differ in significant ways but unlike in the past this has not resulted in a stalemate on moving forward this is significant not only because technological advances are revolutionizing the way we trade and therefore wto rules must be updated to deal with them it also demonstrates that members are willing and able to proceed with negotiations on a plurilateral basis and that the consensus model that hampered many efforts in the past may no longer hold sway this too is a positive development for the wto and for the rules based trading system wto dispute settlement mechanism the wto dispute settlement system has always been busy close to 600 disputes have been filed since 1995 and the number of active disputes ongoing at any time has been rising each year thirty eight new disputes were filed in 2018 and 10 appeals were filed so far this year 10 new disputes were filed as were 2 appeals there are currently 12 appeals before the appellate body 3 of which were filed by the united states these statistics seem to belie what many have referred to as a crisis in the wto dispute settlement system despite the increasing likelihood that the appellate body will no longer be able to receive new appeals by december of this year because the number of judges will be reduced to one and three are needed to sit on any appeal developed and developing country members continue to rely on the wto to resolve their trade disputes in fact some members have agreed in writing at the commencement of dispute settlement procedures that if the appellate body is composed of less than three members on the date of circulation of the panel report they will not appeal the report this is especially significant given that the rate of appeal of panel reports has traditionally been very high on average 70 0 per year we see members continued willingness to resort to the wto dispute settlement mechanism flawed as they consider it to be as very positive for the wto it is also indicative of the fact that the wto offers the only viable mechanism to resolve major international trade disputes between states in sum we are encouraged by the reform effort and applaud canada s leadership in this vein these efforts must be sustained however in order to achieve meaningful results brexit another factor in creating uncertainty in international trade and economic relations is brexit it remains unclear exactly how this saga will end or when prime minister may s premiership has been destroyed by her failure to develop a plan to take britain out of the eu that could command a majority in parliament the credibility of britain s two main parties has been undermined in the process the union itself may be in jeopardy and yet despite the difficulties of agreeing on how to leave the eu the biggest challenge still lies ahead determining the nature of the future relationship between the united kingdom uk and the eu that should be a major focus of attention in the coming months a better understanding of the challenges of how to fashion that relationship to benefit uk national interest might well facilitate better final decisions on how to leave the eu or to abandon the project altogether the trade world through canadian eyes prospects for cusma as noted above the prospects for ratification of the cusma have been improved by the agreement to remove the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum key congressional leaders had made it clear that this was an essential step to ratifying the agreement of course canada and mexico also agreed to remove the counter tariffs which they had imposed in retaliation for the u s action what is less obvious in the reporting is that as the americans point out in their may 17 press release 11 the agreement provides for aggressive monitoring and a mechanism to prevent surges in imports of steel and aluminum if surges in imports of specific steel and aluminum products occur the united states may reimpose section 232 tariffs on those products in the agreement canada has undertaken to prevent the importation of aluminum and steel that is unfairly subsidized and or sold at dumped prices and to prevent the transshipment of aluminum and steel made outside of canada or the united states to the other country it is not clear how these objectives will be realized it is not unlikely that difficult bilateral discussions still lie ahead although it is to be hoped that the americans would not readily reimpose these tariffs on may 29 canada began the formal process to ratify the cusma when prime minister trudeau introduced in the house of commons bill c 100 an act to implement the agreement between canada the united states of america and the united mexican states 12 the government has indicated that canada will proceed in tandem with the united states and mexico in implementing cusma suggesting that canada will not complete the legislative process until the united states is also well engaged of course little time is left for new parliamentary business before the fall election clearly this move is not unrelated to vice president pence s visit to ottawa on may 30 pence has been traveling in the united states to extoll the benefits of the new agreement and to build support for its ratification in congress he and the prime minister compared notes on the prospects for ratification and on how to build momentum to help get the new north american free trade agreement nafta ratified in three countries movement by canada may serve as a useful example for the administration as it tries to persuade the democrats to get on board in addition by moving forward in this way the government may well encounter less pressure from the americans to tweak the canadian legislative proposals than would be the case if the americans had already got the deal through congress it is worth noting that the mulroney government put the nafta implementing legislation through parliament while the side agreement negotiations on labour and environment were still underway certainly securing congressional ratification of cusma is a big deal for the trump administration u s trade representative robert lighthizer s testimony to the house ways means committee on february 27 2019 is definitive on that score there is no trade program in the united states if we don t pass the if the congress doesn t see fit to pass that then everything else is kind of like a footnote we can t do trade deals what it says is that we don t have a consensus and that we don t want to stand up for our workers and our farmers and our ranchers we have an agreement that is clearly better than its predecessor it s 1 3 trillion worth of business millions and millions of people are affected and it just has to pass 13 the president s threat to apply import duties to all mexican products as a result of his concerns about migration from mexico underlines the unpredictability of his approach to trade however in our view it is unlikely that duties will actually be applied in large part because of the serious negative reaction to his proposal inside the united states notably from leading republicans in congress whether it is possible for the administration to secure congressional approval before the 2020 american election is unclear there does not seem to be great enthusiasm in congress particularly among democrats to take this on at this time but it is noteworthy that the democrats have been careful in what they have said about the new agreement putting it into law has not been ruled out of hand interestingly the proposals for change that have been identified by democrats probably pose greater problems for republicans than for canada or mexico they seem to involve strengthening the dispute settlement provisions of the agreement and weakening the agreed protection for biologic drugs in the pharmaceutical area under the terms of u s law it is possible for the cusma to be considered by the next congress pursuant to the current trade promotion authority including its provisions for fast track treatment in congress making cptpp and ceta work for canadians as noted above canada now has preferences in europe japan and other cptpp markets that are not enjoyed by our american competitors we should be moving now as a top priority to take advantage of these opportunities and to consolidate our position in those markets it may be some years before the united states negotiates equivalent market access particularly in europe in japan our preferences may be eroded more quickly but even so we should work hard to ensure that canada gets its share of benefits from the new liberalization of the japanese market one challenge for canadian businesses is identifying where exactly the new opportunities are this requires people perhaps from the private sector who are knowledgeable about the trade dynamics of particular products and who are prepared to spend time going through the tariff schedules it may sound tedious but the payoffs could be very large indeed the government has already put considerable effort into assisting business to take advantage of the new market access but further effort now should pay dividends for years to come managing challenges in china canadians are learning quickly just how difficult it is to manage our trade relations with china when our dominant trading partner the united states is exchanging trade blows with china despite the difficulties we should not lose sight of the fact that china is our second largest trading partner and that it is an important market for many canadian products particularly in the agricultural sector the current furor concerning canadian canola exports to china is a good starting point for thinking about how to proceed the assumption in canada has been that our canola exports have stopped because the chinese government has decided to punish canada for its arrest of huawei executive meng wanzhou pursuant to an american extradition request this seems a reasonable assumption and is further bolstered by recent experience with chinese restrictions on canadian canola exports because of an alleged risk posed by a fungal infection called blackleg if we look deeper into what is going on we learn that according to a united states department of agriculture usda report14 african swine fever asf is a game changer for global oilseed markets asf has resulted in a reported decline of 20 0 in the size of china s pig herd since august 2018 as a consequence the usda is forecasting an accumulated decline in china s import demand for soybeans of 42 million metric tons through 2019 20 senior american officials are cautioning producers about relying on sales of soy and corn to china and recommending that instead they focus on exporting meat and ethanol to that market it is relevant to note that oilseed products like canola and soy are crushed to make oil and meal the meal is used as animal feed so that economics of the crushing industry in china are dramatically affected by the enormous reduction in the size of the swine herd while the effects of asf are dramatic it seems that the chinese are also moving away from a pork supply model that relies on domestic hog production fed by imported feed grains to a model based on greater imports of pork meat to satisfy consumer demand if what we are seeing is a fundamental shift in the economics of chinese food production getting the chinese to remove disease related restrictions on canadian exports will at best only partially restore our markets for canola it is important to make an accurate diagnosis of the problem before deciding on our response perhaps canadians should be looking at investing in oilseed crushing facilities in canada producing meal for canadian livestock exporting more meat to china and other markets as well as oil under the new access gained in japan and elsewhere as a result of the cptpp china is going to continue to be a major and growing importer of food and agricultural products canadians can expect to find significant opportunities in china over the coming years despite the current downturn in the relationship one final point on the canola file the chinese authorities are probably pleased that canadians think that the decline in canola shipments is solely the result of chinese retaliation rather than also the result of a fundamental change in market conditions after all they are trying to change canadian behaviour another lesson here is that we should try to avoid becoming too dependent on any one market for sales of a particular commodity we are trying to diversify away from overdependence on the u s market we should bear this in mind as we consider how best to develop our relations with china conclusion we consider that while the outlook for global trade remains uncertain there are some developments which suggest that the fears of global trade disruption evident in the current behaviour of financial markets will prove to be overblown in particular we see a few positive developments which suggest a slight evolution in the trade policy approach of the trump administration the trump administration has continued to focus on china but has made an effort to shore up its trade relations with traditional allies perhaps the difficulties faced by farmers and others with the effects on their livelihood of trade retaliation have played a role these developments also underline once again the value of advocacy efforts that reach out to our natural allies in the united states section iii canadian outlook recent developments growth in canada was only 0 4 at an annual rate in both 2018q4 and 2019q1 its slowest pace since 2016q2 in 2019q1 growth continued to be depressed by weakening housing and goods exports but household consumption and business non residential fixed investment rose sharply moreover there was a substantial rebound of real gdp growth in march with gains widespread across industrial sectors core cpi inflation has continued to be at or close to 2 0 in the first four months of 2019 consistent with an economy not far from capacity and inflation expectations solidly anchored at 2 0 various indicators of average wage rate showed only modest yearly growth rates at the beginning of 2019 the bank of canada has kept its policy interest rate at 1 75 since october 2018 on a monthly basis the canadian dollar has remained near 75 u s cents since mid 2018 prospects to 2021 the profile of canadian growth to 2021 has changed since our fall outlook whereas previously canadian growth was projected to gradually slow toward its potential rate starting in 2019 in the current projection growth falls below potential in 2019 but rises slightly above potential in 2020 and 2021 thus real gdp growth decelerates to 1 3 in 2019 from 1 8 in 2018 before rebounding to 1 9 in both 2020 and 2021 table 1 1 many economies experienced a slowdown in 2018q4 against a background of high trade uncertainty tighter financial conditions and political headwinds but in canada the deceleration was more severe than elsewhere primarily because of a substantial drop in the price of western canadian oil this shock has depressed canadian real national income employment and investment in the oil and gas sector and related industries and household spending in oil producing provinces excess capacity re emerged in 2018q4 and has increased in 2019q1 from a relatively weak position in early 2019 the canadian economy is expected to gradually gain momentum leading to above potential growth by 2020 to a considerable extent the projected gain in momentum stems from a fading of the negative effects that have weighted on the economy recently thus to quote the bank of canada in its april 2019 monetary policy report p 9 the dampening effects on growth of low oil prices changes to housing policies and the 2017 18 increases in borrowing rates should dissipate over 2019 this would contribute to a stabilization of housing and a firming of household consumption growth in consumption is nevertheless expected to be moderate over the short term besides the fading of negative factors a number of positive developments should enhance canadian growth going forward business investment outside the oil and gas sector would benefit from new tax changes by the federal ontario and québec governments healthy growth in u s activity rising production capacity in canada the assumed ratification of cusma which would reduce trade uncertainty and the projected alleviation of transportation constraint on shipments of western canadian oil through rail and pipeline expansion assumed to be completed by the end of 2021 would provide support to growth in exports and investment exports of travel and commercial services should continue to grow at a robust pace taken together the 2019 budgets before reserve of the federal québec ontario and b c governments provide no impulse to growth either positive or negative in 2019 see section iv table 4 1 fiscal consolidation gives rise to negative impulses to growth of about 0 3 of gdp each year from 2020 to 2023 with the additional fiscal restraint to be expected in the next alberta budget the negative impulse to canadian growth will probably reach 0 4 of canadian gdp each year over the next four years which means that canadian real gdp growth could be cut by 0 2 to 0 4 in each of those years the bank of canada has made clear that monetary policy is data dependent should the canadian economy unfold as we and the bank of canada project 15 then a cautious bank of canada would continue to keep its policy rate steady at 1 75 but move the policy rate toward 2 25 the bottom of the neutral rate range by 2021 as above potential growth re emerges raising the policy rate to its neutral level 2 25 to 3 25 16 would be consistent with keeping the economy at potential and inflation on target going into the medium term our assumptions concerning oil prices growth and policy interest rates in the united states and canada lead us to expect that the canadian dollar will continue to move in a range near 75 u s cents in 2019 as in our fall outlook the center of the band will tend to rise in the next two years to perhaps 78 u s cents by 2021 the expected expansion of crude oil exports as production and transportation capacities increase would provide support to the canadian dollar risks to the canadian outlook the risks to our global outlook that were identified at the end of section i represent risks to our canadian outlook as well a full blown trade war between the united states and china would have grave consequences for global growth trade and commodity prices with important negative repercussions on canada see section ii on trade adverse global trade developments represent the biggest downside risk for the canadian outlook bilateral issues with the united states and china also present some downside risk however stronger than expected u s growth would provide some offsetting upside risk to canadian growth our canadian outlook is also at risk due to factors that apply more particularly to canada housing may experience more weakness in the near term than implied by the soft landing implicit in our projection this being said downward price correction in large metropolitan markets would help improve housing affordability another risk is that the western canadian oil price may deviate more dramatically and persistently from the projected average price thereby posing risks in either direction to canadian growth a related but negative risk to growth particularly in western canada would be that the coming on stream by 2021 of one or more of the three planned oil pipeline additions enbridge line 3 replacement trans mountain expansion and keystone xl be delayed if not canceled on the other hand we may underestimate the stimulus to growth that the construction and operation of these pipelines would provide over the projection horizon a final risk is the failure of the united states to ratify the usmca followed by a possible break up of nafta contrary to our expectations canadian exports and investment would suffer as a result section iv a macro perspective on 2019 budgets in this section we provide a brief analysis of 2019 budgets in canada from a macro perspective earlier this year the federal québec ontario and b c governments released their 2019 budgets which extend to 2021 22 for b c and 2023 24 for the others the alberta government has yet to come up with a new budget in 2019 we begin our analysis by looking at the consolidated 2019 budget of the federal québec ontario and b c governments for which we have hard data among other things we assess how restrictive or stimulative the consolidated fiscal policy of these governments could be to canadian economic growth over the next five years we then analyze the 2019 budgetary projections of each of the four large jurisdictions separately and finish by discussing fiscal prospects for alberta in anticipation of the next budget consolidated 2019 budgets the 2019 budgets largely reflect the view that the united states and canadian economies start growing at roughly their potential rates in the short term interest rates and bond yields are projected to rise slowly from current levels the canadian dollar is expected to strengthen steadily from near 75 u s cents in 2019 to 80 u s cents in 2023 and the wti oil price is expected to rise from slightly below us 60 in 2019 to around us 65 in 2023 there are some differences in the profiles of these variables across the four 2019 budgets but by and large they are relatively minor taken together the 2019 budgets of the federal québec ontario and b c governments project own source revenues to grow rather slowly in 2019 20 after an unexpectedly strong advance in 2018 19 except in ontario and then to increase at nearly the same pace as canadian nominal gdp over the next four years table 4 1 program expenses increase at 2 5 per year through to 2023 24 a sharp slowdown from the accelerated pace of 2017 18 and 2018 19 this downshift can be found in all the four jurisdictions but is largest in ontario in contrast public debt charges steadily increase relative to own source revenue over the next five years even as net debt declines relative to canadian gdp this is due to a significant rise in the interest cost of new borrowing relative to that of maturing debt the overall budget deficit before reserve reaches a peak of 23 billion or 1 0 of gdp in 2019 20 and steadily shrinks to zero by 2023 24 net capital investments decline significantly over the next five years reflecting downward trends projected in the federal and ontario budgets in québec and b c net capital investments significantly increase from their 2018 19 levels shrinking budget deficits and reduced net capital investments lead to a steady decline in the consolidated net debt relative to canadian gdp table 4 1 consolidated 2019 budgets before reserve of federal québec ontario and b c governments 2018 19 2019

c governments pursue a program of fiscal consolidation founded on restraint in program spending growth and cuts in net capital investments for 2019 20 these budgets before reserve taken together are neutral generating no impulse to growth either positive or negative fiscal restraint gives rise to negative impulses to growth of about 0 3 of gdp from 2020 21 to 2023 24 table 4 1 which means that canadian real gdp growth could be cut by between 0 1 and 0 3 each year as a result with the additional fiscal retrenchment to be expected in the next alberta budget the negative impulse to canadian growth will probably reach 0 4 of canadian gdp each year over the next four years this means that canadian real gdp growth could be reduced by 0 2 to 0 4 from what it might have been in each of those years as a result of budgetary policies the 2019 federal budget the federal government projects its total revenues to grow a bit slower than nominal gdp from 2019 20 to 2023 24 but only because of a temporary decline in corporate income taxes in 2019 20 reflecting temporary measures proposed in the fall update to stimulate investment table 4 2 at the same time program expenses expand at a rate slightly inferior to population growth plus inflation even as a substantial increase in the amount of direct fuel charge proceeds returned to the public in the context of the federal carbon pricing system boosts program spending growth by 0 3 per year public debt charges increase rapidly as debt expands and borrowing costs rise overall the budget deficit tops at 19 8 billion in 2019 20 and 2020 21 before shrinking to 9 8 billion by 2023 24 dragging down the accumulated deficit to gdp ratio to 28 6 in 2023 24 from 30 8 in 2018 19 the federal government also trims its net capital investments markedly relative to 2018 19 thus reinforcing the negative impact of the deficit contraction on net debt 17 indeed the net debt to gdp ratio falls to 32 2 in 2023 24 from 34 7 in 2018 19 table 4 2 federal government budget 2019 2018 19 2019 20 2020 21 2021 22 2022 23 2023 24 total revenues changes 6 7 2 0 3 7 4 4 3 8 3 9 program expenses changes 4 9 1 8 3 1 2 5 2 9 3 0 public debt charges

federal minister of finance should take no spending or tax actions which would further compromise a future government s room to take the necessary discretionary action to support growth and public investment in the event of a major economic downturn 18 in fact in its 2019 budget the federal government launched measures to stimulate housing and investment in the short term which contributed to a significant expansion of the deficit and kept progress in reducing the debt ratio to a minimum while the increased tax allowances for business investment rightly aimed at preserving canada s tax competitiveness the new initiatives to boost housing demand may not have been warranted in light of the already high levels of ownership rate and household debt in canada the federal government abstained from significantly strengthening its finances in the near term and hence will continue to have only modest fiscal room to provide economic stimulus in the event of a significant slowdown or recession this slowdown could originate from weaker global activity due to trade wars or other factors see section i it could also result from a combination of adverse domestic factors such as a major housing correction weaker western canadian oil prices and bilateral trade issues as outlined in section iii the planned or expected fiscal consolidation of governments from 2020 21 to 2023 24 if implemented could reduce growth by as much as 0 4 per year after 2019 as excess supply would grow rapidly as a result of an abrupt collapse of global demand there would be great pressure on the federal government to provide fiscal stimulus to supplement the expected easing of policy rates by the bank of canada to illustrate the implications of this situation suppose that the canadian nominal gdp turns flat in 2020 and that fiscal revenues automatically fall by about 3 0 in the year while program spending including some discretionary stimulus could increase by as much as 8 0 these rates are half those experienced in 2009 at the worst of the great recession the budget deficit before reserve in 2020 21 would more than double to over 40 billion and the net debt to gdp ratio before reserve would rise by about 2 points to about 36 3 instead of declining to 34 0 as budgeted even if the shock was to be completely reversed by 2023 24 in the sense that gdp revenues and program spending get back to the same levels as in the base case by that year the net debt to gdp ratio would still be higher than in the base case by 1 point in 2023 24 because over the years larger deficits would have accumulated into a larger debt the important point to keep in mind is that even a temporary shock to gdp revenues and spending has a permanent effect on debt of course the shock may be only partially reversed over time in which case its impact on the debt ratio could be much greater the 2019 québec budget in its 2019 budget the government of québec projects continued moderate budget surpluses through to 2023 24 and a marked decline in its net debt gdp ratio from 40 0 in 2018 19 to 34 8 in 2023 24 table 4 3 on average program expenses increase by 3 4 per annum from 2019 20 to 2023 24 significantly faster than the pace of inflation plus population growth own source revenues grow at a slightly faster pace than nominal gdp in the last four years of the projection but at a much slower rate in 2019 20 as corporate taxes and the school property tax temporarily decline in response to policy measures introduced earlier table 4 3 québec government budget 2019 2018 19 2019 20 2020

5 3 2 3 0 3 0 3 1 as we surmised last february the québec government used the room provided by solid budget surpluses in previous years to lower tax rates and continue to increase program spending at a fast pace in 2019 20 the government scales down program spending growth in subsequent years to a still solid rate in order to maintain progress in reducing its debt ratio emulating the federal government it introduced an enhanced capital cost allowance to foster business investment and keep its marginal effective tax rates for businesses highly competitive in its 2019 budget the government reports that in the event of an average recession for québec the cumulative loss of own source revenue relative to a base case would be 5 5 billion after the first two years and 8 1 billion after five years taking account of some increase in program spending as modest automatic stabilizers kick in the negative impact of the downturn on the budget balance would be even greater at least in the first two years if such a downturn was to start in 2020 21 the projected steady surpluses in the current budget would turn into moderate deficits before reserve the net debt to gdp ratio before reserve would rise from 38 7 in 2019 20 to a peak of 40 7 in 2021 22 instead of falling to 36 8 in that year by 2023 24 the debt ratio would be down to 38 8 instead of 34 7 thus an average recession would severely hamper the objective of reducing the debt ratio but in all likelihood would not jeopardize the high credit rating of québec as we pointed out before one key challenge for québec is to raise potential growth in the economy this would allow a reduction of the relatively high tax rates in the province and or stronger program spending growth without compromising the debt reduction objective the 2019 budget provides for initiatives to boost québec s potential totaling 3 7 billion over the next five years in addition to the measures announced last fall to stimulate business investment including accelerated depreciation measures the 2019 ontario budget in its 2019 budget the new government of ontario implemented the strategy it outlined last fall of eliminating the provincial deficit in five years through restraint on program spending growth while at the same time lowering taxes the needed degree of restraint was eased somewhat by higher revenues and hence a 2 8 billion smaller deficit for 2018 19 than what was expected in the fall economic statement fes the 2019 budget proposes to restrain growth in program spending to 1 0 a year on average in order to eliminate the deficit table 4 4 it is based on the projection that revenues both from own sources and federal transfers grow at only 3 0 a year and that public debt charges increase by 4 3 a year with both debt and borrowing costs rising the budget includes a 1 0 to 1 6 billion reserve each year as will be discussed below the projected weak growth of revenues reflects unannounced tax cuts over 2021 22 to 2023 24 a sharply reduced deficit and a marked contraction of net capital investments first stabilize the net debt to gdp ratio at 40 7 in the short term and bring it down to 38 6 by 2023 24 table 4 4 ontario government budget 2019 2018 19 2019 20 2020 21 2021 22 2022 23 2023 24 total revenues changes 0 1 2 3 3 6 2 4 2 9 3 9 program expenses changes 5 4 0 1 1 2 1 3 1 3 1 2 public debt charges millions 12

40 7 40 6 39 8 38 6 nominal gdp changes 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 2 3 6 3 9 the 1 0 annual growth in program spending that is required to eliminate the deficit in five years rests in large part on the assumption that important efficiency gains in public service delivery will be realized year after year this will be very difficult to achieve once the low hanging fruits are collected in the first few years the fiscal accountability office fao reckons that significant future policy decisions will likely be needed for the province to achieve the 2019 budget s spending projections starting in 2021 22 19 we believe that the projected spending restraint if fully realized will entail important cuts in the quantity and or quality of services the fiscal drag implied by this budget will act to slow growth in ontario somewhat with a negative feedback on the deficit we estimate that the negative fiscal impulses from the budget before reserve average 0 6 of ontario gdp in 2019 20 and 2020 21 and 0 3 in the next three years for this reason we proposed in our pre budget analysis in february that the government lengthen the planned retrenchment period the province will also need to raise more revenue from sources other than income taxes to bridge the gap between revenues and expenses according to the fao the budget s fiscal plan incorporates provisions for unannounced measures presumably tax cuts which have reduced projected revenue by 2 2 billion in 2021 22 3 4 billion in 2022 23 and 3 6 billion in 2023 24 this helps explain why revenue growth in the budget is much weaker than nominal gdp growth after 2020 21 without these unannounced revenue measures the government could have afforded to let its program spending grow by 2 0 per year instead of 1 2 per year over 2021 22 to 2023 24 while still balancing its budget including reserve by 2023 24 somewhat higher growth in spending would materially reduce potential cuts in public services and distribute the burden of adjustment more evenly between taxpayers service providers and beneficiaries of the services ontario s fiscal objectives are highly vulnerable to a major economic slowdown revenues would flatten or fall expenditures would increase more than planned and the deficit before reserve would enlarge a slowdown to zero real gdp growth in one year would cause the deficit to increase by about 3 5 billion far exceeding the 1 to 1 6 billion reserve provided if this deficit were entirely financed by increased borrowing public debt charges would increase and the province s credit rating would be impaired higher debt charges would require even greater spending reductions in the future in short even if the province does manage to implement its highly constrained plan for program spending over the next five years the province is at severe risk of not being able to bring its net debt to gdp ratio to less than 40 0 as planned the 2019 b c budget the 2019 b c budget extends only to 2021 22 so the projections for 2022 23 and 2023 24 shown in table 4 5 below are our own with a small surplus and low debt ratio in 2018 19 the b c government eliminates the medical services plan premiums in 2020 and allows program spending to grow at about the same pace as total revenues year after year thereby keeping the budgetary balance in small surplus throughout the government also materially increases its net capital investments relative to 2018 19 which explains why its net debt ratio rises to 16 1 in 2021 22 from 14 8 in 2018 19 even as small budget surpluses are generated throughout overall the strategy laid out in the 2019 budget is much in line with the expectations we had in our pre budget analysis b c does have some room to absorb a year of zero real growth through a mix of increased borrowing moderate reductions in the growth of program spending and possibly of capital expenditures as well table 4 5 b c government budget 2019 our own projections 2018 19 2019 20 2020 21 2021 22 2022 23 2023 24 total revenues changes

debt to gdp ratio because generally strong resource revenues prior to 2015 were able to pay for very high spending levels and still generate a net financial asset position with the collapse of resource revenues after 2014 alberta has since been a heavy net borrower with the second highest level of per capita spending among the provinces in 2017 18 and a relatively low level of revenues relative to expenses the trajectory of the debt to gdp ratio is sharply upward and unsustainable the former alberta government did not release an update of its budget 2018 projections except for 2018 19 in february 2019 at that time the deficit for 2018 19 was estimated to be 6 9 billion even with program expenses growing at only 1 5 in the year the new government has yet to release a budget but given the starting point it is very hard to see how the deficit could be eliminated over the next five years without both severe spending restraint and a significant increase in non resource revenues relative to gdp we assume that resource revenues fall in 2019 20 but increase by over 60 in the next four years due to increases in oil production and transportation capacities under a status quo assumption other own source revenues would grow roughly at the pace of nominal gdp in alberta i e 2 0 in 2019 20 and 4 0 to 5 0 in subsequent years and federal transfers at about 3 5 per year even assuming program nominal spending growth of only 1 per annum in each and every one of the next five years the deficit would only fall to zero in 2023 24 such a degree of spending restraint would be difficult to sustain over such a long period it would generate a negative fiscal impulse equivalent to 0 5 of alberta nominal gdp and 0 1 of canadian nominal gdp thereby slowing growth and making fiscal consolidation harder to achieve section v planning parameters for canadian business our overall outlook for global economic growth has not much changed from what we presented last fall although the downside risk of trade disruption has increased we advise businesses to plan on the assumption that global growth in 2019 will slow to about 3 3 from the strong 3 7 experienced in 2017 and 2018 we expect that the period of slow growth that the world has generally experienced since the last quarter of 2018 is temporary despite trade uncertainties we are optimistic that growth in the second half of this year and into next year will pick up and that the world economy will operate near potential of 3 3 growth at annual rates we think that it is appropriate to plan on moderately strong growth to continue in 2020 and 2021 on the assumption that the united states and china will come to some sort of acceptable arrangement as cooler heads prevail our view is that the u s economy will grow at the above potential rate of 2 5 this year although the risk of trade disruption remains high levels of employment and consumption will prevail as the stimulative effect of the 2017 tax cuts and expenditure increase continue albeit at a diminishing rate u s growth is likely to slow to potential of 1 9 in 2020 and 2021 chinese growth should remain at or above 6 0 spurred by stimulative policy with good global growth the demand for commodities should grow modestly and we look for relatively flat commodity prices over the next three years although with fairly high month to month and year to year volatility as we indicated last fall we think it is appropriate to plan on wti oil price fluctuating around a trend of us 60 65 per barrel over the period to the end of 2021 what has changed significantly from last fall is our view on the trajectory of interest rates last fall we and most economic analysts were of the view that central banks in north america and europe would continue to raise policy interest rates in 2019 and 2020 to more neutral levels in the face of trade uncertainties central banks in early 2019 changed their guidance about future tightening they now say that monetary policy will be data dependent which many analysts and market watchers have interpreted as indicating reduced rates going forward markets have pushed bond rates below overnight rates to produce an inverted yield curve because they assign a high probability to trade disruptions actually significantly reducing growth as we assign a very much lower probability to trade disruptions weakening growth in 2020 and 2021 we continue to anticipate central banks modestly raising policy interest rates by 2021 we thus anticipate the yield curve to revert to its normal shape by 2021 based on the above scenario we think business should plan on the basis of canadian growth averaging about 1 3 this year up from 0 4 at annual rates in the first quarter growth in 2020 and 2021 is likely to come in at a little less than 2 0 on balance the risks to this outlook are on the downside in 2020 but with the completion of three important pipelines there is an upside risk that growth in western canada may resume more strongly by the end of 2021 as both volumes and prices of western canadian select wcs oil improve with the global and canadian outlook above the canadian dollar should appreciate mildly to 78 u s cents by the end of 2021 again assuming the canadian economy develops as per the above scenario the bank of canada might be expected to raise its policy interest rate to 2 25 by the end of the period in closing we emphasize that these planning parameters are based on our analysis which attaches a fairly low probability to a major trade dispute disrupting global growth we think the better judgement is that calmer heads in washington and beijing will prevail and that in the end some sort of agreement will be reached that will permit business on both sides of the pacific to invest with reasonable confidence that global supply chains still make economic sense similarly we believe that cusma will eventually be approved by congress and that there are renewed

deficit indeed net debt results not only from the accumulation of budget deficits but also from the accumulation of net borrowing to finance investments in capital assets these investments are not reflected in the measured deficits and accumulated deficits except through the provision for the amortization of capital in program spending both accumulated deficits and net debt are useful measures

the government announced in the budget its decision to raise a part of its gross borrowing in foreign markets a foreign currency denominated bond issue is planned in a few months a successful bond issue always reflects well on the issuer and there will be some satisfaction from knowing that there are ready takers globally for indian government paper but a question arises what is the need for going in for this and is there a downside to it india first went in for what can be called quasi sovereign borrowing in 1991 when it was in the throes of the most serious payments crisis in its history by getting the state bank of india to issue the india development bonds totalling 1 6 billion but today the situation could not be more different with foreign exchange reserves exceeding 400 billion if you do not need the hard currency but still go in for a bit of borrowing in it then the main reason after all a bigger hard currency raising can only result in having to bear a larger exchange rate risk must be to test the water it will discover how fine low a rate at which the country can borrow and implicitly the country risk that the global financial markets attach to it the finer the rate the lower the perceived country risk but there is a catch the interest rate that a bond issue bears is determined by both global supply and demand right now the global markets are flush with funds and so issue managers will be hard selling to potential borrowers latin american experience take the case of latin american countries in the aftermath of the oil price hikes in the seventies when the global markets were awash with petro dollars they borrowed cheap and wide but then the chickens came home to roost when the global financial crisis broke in the late eighties and it was followed by a string of latin american defaults so being able to borrow cheap is certainly indicative of investors low risk perception but that is not the entire story one likely consequence of a successful international bond issue will be a quicker accretion to reserves which will inevitably make the rupee stronger when it is already in the process of appreciating against the us dollar is this desirable at this juncture india s exports have again started picking up after several years of stagnation so what is needed is a favourable exchange rate that is a slightly depreciating rupee also an appreciating rupee will make imports cheaper this will be desirable if india seeks to follow the trade expansion path to growth under such a scenario cheaper imported inputs along with efficient value addition at home will enable the country to achieve a rapid growth in exports thus adopting the east asian path of export led growth the measures taken to promote make in india are in line with this but after balancing out the pluses and minuses in the new tariff rates announced the tariff barrier around india appears to have gone up marginally so will we be working at cross purposes if on one hand we make imports dearer by raising tariffs and on the other make them cheaper by allowing the rupee to appreciate in fact if the country goes in for anything near to a significant and continued policy of sovereign foreign bond issues then there must be a firm regime in place to ensure that exports do well and adequate reserves are built up when the time comes to redeem the bonds issued after the payments crisis of the early nineties india was able to rebuild its reserves on the back of rapidly rising exports and thus be in a comfortable position to not just redeem the bonds but repay the large loans taken from the multilateral financial institutions one of the conditionalities the global institutions invariably impose while giving a large loan is sharp devaluation a bond issue of the sort being contemplated will naturally not involve such conditionalities but its overall impact will be indisputable it will set in motion a process which will integrate the indian economy more closely with the global scenario since there is currently some disenchantment with globalisation the correct intellectual approach should be to wait and watch the government claims the bond issue decision has been taken after a long internal debate one of its pluses is it will enable the government to draw less on the domestic financial savings pool and allow corporates to raise resources at lower rates but the government can just as easily place rupee bonds with the rbi and draw against them it seems politics eventually got the better of economics what won was the desire to project a muscular india on the global stage one which can make a successful bond issue at an extremely fine coupon rate comparable to top economies and take the credit for it domestically the writer is a senior journalist

bloomberg opinion federal reserve independence is on trial in washington again president donald trump s top economic adviser larry kudlow broke with decades of economic orthodoxy on tuesday when he agreed with the prominent supply sider arthur laffer that fed independence is undemocratic and that monetary policy should be handled by the treasury department or congress then on wednesday maxine waters chair of the house financial services committee urged fed chairman jerome powell to resist efforts by the white house to compromise his institution s autonomy like most economists i consider fed independence to be a valuable tool at the same time the conservative laffer raised important concerns many of which are echoed on the left by adherents of modern monetary theory supply side theory emerged in the 1970s and argued that a combination of tax cuts and relatively low interest rates could bring down inflation and grow the economy supply siders waved away concerns about deficits modern monetary theory argues that government spending should be used to sustain growth and that any resulting deficits should be financed by monetary policy mmt waves away concerns about inflation most of the commentary around these theories focuses on their lack of concern about deficits that lack of concern however is a product of their rejection of central bank independence with the central bank at its disposal the white house could always control the high interest rates that deficits encourage both supply siders and mmt adherents justify this stance by arguing that monetary policy is a tool of public policy that should not be controlled by a technocratic committee of economists any more than foreign policy should be controlled by generals this is an unorthodox stance but it deserves to be taken seriously the first is democratic accountability the reason for creating an independent fed is to reduce the influence of democracy on monetary policy the thinking is that democratic bodies and the public are likely to be shortsighted ignoring long term risks like inflation that could follow politically popular tax cuts or spending increases instead monetary policy should be run by experts trained to recognize those risks and address them when the fed meets to discuss interest rate changes only seven the chair and six governors out of a total of 19 decision makers are appointed by the president and approved by the senate the other 12 are regional fed presidents who are appointed by their respective boards the fed s unusual voting structure requires seven of the 12 presidents to sit out each vote theoretically giving the white house appointees a majority currently however two governorships are vacant meaning that the regional presidents have as much voting power as the federally appointed chair and governors nor is this situation unusual when trump came into office two of the governorships were vacant and two more governors resigned soon after this structure implies that despite trump s efforts to pressure the fed to raise interest rates neither the white house nor congress has much power to compel the fed to do anything the fed was set up this way so that it could take a long term view without being influenced by the next election or the whims of the party in power as laffer pointed out in a cnbc interview on monday however it also removes a powerful tool that governments have for making policy as a supply sider laffer believes that the fed should lower interest rates to accelerate economic growth encourage investment and make the most of the recently passed tax cuts i generally agree the fed s rapid pace of interest rate increases combined with the trump s haphazard trade policy have increased uncertainty and caused businesses to pull back on investment at precisely the moment when it s most advantageous for them to plow ahead as a result the u s economy won t get a clean test of the power of tax cuts to spur long term growth unlike laffer however i am willing to swallow this bitter pill because the same institutional structure that prevents supply side economics from being fully implemented also constrains mmt mmt is risky because it overlooks the long term costs of increased government spending spending speeds up economic growth quickly and give politicians concrete projects they can tout as signs of success the costs come later sometimes decades later as the return on investment from projects chosen for political popularity turns out to be less than expected the larger and more expansive the political vision the more difficult it is to abandon even in the face of disappointing results mmt advocates have sweeping economic plans like the green new deal and job guarantees for all americans like supply side economics there is no way that these plans could be put into place unless the fed plays along this similarity between the supply side and mmt approach to the fed reflects a deeper philosophical kinship both schools of thought believe that the u s economy has untapped productive capacity that aggressive coordination between monetary and fiscal policy could reach the difference is that supply siders are attempting to jump start the private sector while mmt is supplying a rationale for expansive government programs like universal health insurance and college tuition subsidies another difference is that while supply siders are waning in influence mmt is on the rise this reflects a change in circumstances supply side economics was born in the 1970s amid rising taxes slowing job growth and accelerating inflation mmt is coming to prominence in an era of moderate taxes and low inflation but stagnant wage growth in the 1970s and 80s according to the gallup poll most americans viewed taxes particularly income taxes as too high today income inequality is a more salient concern both then and now however the problem is complex advances in technology changes in international trade the entry and now exit of the baby boom generation from the workforce wreaked slow havoc across the economy both in the 1970s and over the last 20 years it s natural then that more heterodox economists as well as the general public would yearn for a more comprehensive solution in 1980 public dissatisfaction reached a boiling point and voters elected president ronald reagan who was ready to implement supply side economics radical prescriptions the fed however forced reagan to pay for his priorities with surging interest rates and a sharp recession that limited his administration s ability to implement its ideas but also ensured that the nation would not veer too far off track if a democratic president embraces mmt it will be crucial for an independent fed to make sure that the potential costs of those policies are transparent not papered over and left for future generations to contact the author of this story karl w smith at ksmith602 bloomberg net to contact the editor responsible for this

heading into may global markets were on the rise amid optimism for an imminent trade deal between the world s two largest economies throughout the spring and into that first week of may u s negotiators reported continued progress on key national security issues and trade laws to reduce intellectual property theft china appeared willing to substantially increase its imports of u s goods narrow the mounting bilateral trade imbalance open its markets to u s financial services and reduce its overseas dumping of artificially low cost subsidized goods in china too expectations ran high in early april the state run xinhua news service reported that the eighth round of talks had achieved new progress in matters pertaining to technology transfer agriculture and enforcement yet barely a month later negotiations sputtered and then stalled altogether u s president donald trump slapped additional tariffs on chinese imports china retaliated with tariffs of its own and pressure on both sides escalated china has always been reluctant to fight but is not afraid to fight noted a xinhua commentary and will fight when necessary now the united states and china have agreed to reopen trade talks to avoid another failure here is what both sides need to understand about the collapse of the last round if a deal is to be struck it will require a greater understanding of what types of provisions key constituencies in china are willing accept and which issues chinese leadership views as foundational to core economic philosophies that they are not willing to abandon some u s analysts have blamed the collapse on u s hardliners fretting about chinese hegemony rather than trade others on a greedy china which they claim returned a draft of the agreement that undid the commitments it had agreed to on the chinese side there were allegations that the trump administration s claims were untruthful and deliberately confusing and that the united states continued to add new demands including the implementation of immediate market reforms what is clear is that both sides were overly confident both understood the other s behaviors and messages through the prism of their own political cultures this led each side to overestimate its leverage and at the end to accuse the other side of reneging the chinese have a saying that there is no triviality in diplomacy that any issue no matter how small matters greatly if it concerns a foreign government its government s economic and political linkages are such that all decisions must accord with the incentives of senior political leaders even with a powerful leader at the helm the politburo and council of ministers along with the central committee the governing body of the communist party must consent or a deal is meaningless moreover all major decision making powers are vested in the hands of provincial or regional party secretaries from the composition of the chinese delegation it should have been evident that china is ready to address issues at the interface or technical level such as trade finance market access and ip protection but is not prepared to do a deep dive into structural reforms or enforcement mechanisms that require a much broader degree of buy in china s ministry of commerce mofcom was prominent in the trade delegation the lead negotiator vice premier liu he received most of the spotlight but his responsibility is limited to commerce finance and technology not present was vice premier han zheng who supervises the national development and reform commission ndrc which tends to structural questions such a subsidies or industrial planning the state owned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council sasac reports to state councilor wang yong a powerful defender of the state enterprise system it was not represented in the meetings the u s side was deaf to what exactly the chinese have been touting about their changing role in the world the word big has become commonplace in chinese government proclamations with big nation diplomacy for example and big ambition belt and road even more ubiquitous is president xi jinping s most used slogan never forget your true heart its implication is that the communist party is saving people from the corrupting influence of capitalist and materialist pursuits and focusing instead on building a socialist market economy with full legitimacy in the global community this schism over structural reforms looms behind the trade negotiations and the technical details of tariffs and quotas it lies at the heart of xi s resolve that china s development path and economic system have evolved and taken root together that each contributes to the success of the other moreover through its economic order china seeks to offer development solutions to other emerging economies and a common destiny for the world as such china has shown that it is prepared to lose money on overseas investments as it builds alliances and trade partnerships worldwide and positions itself as a rival to the u s system of liberal internationalist order thus if a deal is to be hammered out it s important not to underestimate that in a profound philosophical sense many chinese like tsinghua university economist hu angang believe that their socialist market economy will outperform any free market economy based solely on individualism the u s system they argue encourages individuals to act according to the lowest aspects of human nature not to its better angels nor do they believe it works well in the early stages of development self serving individuals may outperform altruistic ones within a cohesive group but in the long run when there is conflict between groups collectivists will defeat selfish individuals the socialist model they maintain offers a viable alternative trajectory with superior poverty eradicating efficiency at the early stages of economic growth they also believe that trump s push to curb china s state owned enterprises will subvert these very qualities that make the socialist market economy unifying and propitious for the future xinhua has gone further saying that u s demands on china s state owned industries would violate sovereignty and constitute an invasion the u s side rejects such concerns as delay tactics this does not bode well under xi china s system of public administration has been overhauled to instill socialist values into managerial personnel at all levels recognizing that understanding and cooperation at the lower levels will foster implementation and enforcement thus contrary to many people s understanding of old school communism management of china s economy is the task of the entire populace in a mass mobilization it is not unlike the nationwide economic wartime efforts among u s civilians during world war ii and is encouraged at all levels of the political hierarchy those lower in the system must feel that their interests ideals and values are part of the national fabric a trade deal that lacks appeal to the various constituencies that must carry it out will be obstructed although a deal that would meet this higher bar has yet to be mapped out there remains much about which both parties can agree what is salvageable is it still possible to pursue a deal that keeps the goodwill alive even as the west concedes that china s rise is not without some costs to its partners deng xiaoping the communist party leader most strongly connected with china s market opening depicted the relationship with the united states as going nowhere good or nowhere bad neither honeymoon nor hostility there will be unhappy encounters he warned but divorce is impossible deng s message of restraint which has many admirers might mean a deal is still possible but only if the u s side avoids overplaying its own hand and doesn t miscalculate the way decisions are actually made in china china has already revised its foreign investment law opened more sectors to direct foreign investment allowed foreign financial services to operate more freely and introduced a specialized ip court it has expressed its willingness to buy more u s goods such as agricultural produce and natural gas the hundred day action plan agreed to by the two presidents at mar a lago in april 2017 was implemented to the satisfaction of both sides but china will not stop its efforts to accelerate the development of homegrown core technologies via subsidies and supportive policies this is nonnegotiable liu he cites the absence of mutual respect as the chief reason for the breakdown of talks in may should he take home a deal dictated to him by the united states he would be denounced as the man who sold his country as was the discredited li hongzhang in 1901 li signed what s known in the west as the boxer protocol one of the so called unequal treaties foisted by on east asia capitulating to 11 western powers and embodying china s century of humiliation the most persuasive argument for a trade deal does not reside in the boasts of one side or another but in a shared confidence that there are plenty of mutual benefits to china s long term development reduction of the trade imbalance ensures a sustained export market ip protection contributes to china s innovation drive treating foreign firms as national firms can restrain the monopoly of state own firms and bring about efficiency that reduces debt level and the rule of law helps social stability and enhances china s international credibility in short an agreement that xi can be present as a welcome move toward deepening china s own economic reforms would give him greater leverage and stand a chance of being accepted at all the levels of chinese society that are necessary to its success with respect to the rule of law and ip protection both sides agree in concept that such legislation is needed but that china lacks the requisite legal and judicial institutional capacity this is why china keeps requesting that both parties recognize the differences in national development and in stages of development thus an agreement on protecting intellectual rights must include joint training programs to promote more common understanding among national legal specialists but again china cannot accept any deal that does not recognize the legitimacy of its aspirations to achieve economic parity with the united states via whatever mechanisms it prefers including state owned enterprises the united states must educate itself on why historically the chinese state has led its economy and why china may be heading into what xi is calling a new long march toward a self reliance that reinforces the people s allegiance to their party leadership and government for the chinese this means pride in their confucian tradition and the harmony it finds with socialist core values their acceptance of hardship and willingness to obey authorities go well beyond the imagination of most americans the chinese by solid consensus agree their current economic structure can propel them to greater global economic stature and that their state owned enterprises even more than the private sector are responsible for a competitive economy the risks of a global technology war only strengthen their resolve china will not alter its fundamental development path until there is conclusive economic evidence to prove that its model is destined for failure in the meantime they view u s criticisms as doctrinal and without basis a financial meltdown or massive bankruptcy of some initiative would be far more effective at bringing about change than the dictates of an alien economic dogma only time and evidence not the prescriptions of a foreign ideology will tell which economic model is best suited to china s interests for now the united states must understand that it has only two options since both sides have assets the other lacks china has manufacturing capacity and a large user and customer base the united states leads in innovation and research neither can definitively win from unending economic warfare the best outcome for both sides is to pursue a deal within the realm of what is feasible and to transform vague promises into verifiable agreements with language and mechanisms that make it enforceable liu baocheng is a professor at the university of international business and economics beijing

federal reserve chairman jerome powell set the stage today for the first us interest rate cut in a decade later this month mr powell pledged to act as appropriate to defend an economic expansion threatened by trade disputes and a global slowdown in testimony to a congressional committee powell pointed to broad global weakness that was clouding the us economic outlook amid uncertainty about the fallout from the trump administration s trade conflict with china and other nations though the us government reported strong job growth for june other major economies data have continued to disappoint that is very broad across europe and around asia and that continues to weigh the head of the us fed said manufacturing trade and investment are weak all around the world we have agreed to begin trade discussions again with china and that is a constructive step it doesn t remove the uncertainty to the suggestion that the current low us unemployment rate could lead to a breakout of inflation powell noted that the overall pace of price increases remains muted and wage gains remain modest signs the fed could reduce rates without risk of an overheating economy we don t have any evidence for calling this a hot labor market powell told the us house of representatives financial services committee to call something hot we need to see some heat the hearing part of the fed chief s semi annual testimony on monetary policy to congress took place against the backdrop of us president donald trump s frequent criticism of the fed and the white house s demands that the central bank lower rates powell chosen by trump to run the fed but now out of his good graces has worked hard to build relations among lawmakers and even on a democratic controlled committee won plaudits and encouragement to stay on the job asked by representative maxine waters who chairs the committee if he would pack up and leave if the president demanded it powell replied with a curt no ma am the law clearly gives me a four year term and i fully intend to serve it in prepared remarks released before the hearing powell contrasted the fed s baseline outlook of continued us growth against a considerable set of risks including persistently weak inflation a slowdown in other major economies and a downturn in business investment driven by trade risks fed officials at their june policy meeting signaled those concerns might warrant lower rates and since then based on incoming data and other developments it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the us outlook jerome powell said apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty and our contacts in business and agriculture reported heightened concerns over trade developments mr powell said noting that business investment an important component of economic growth seems to have slowed notably in recent months powell is setting it up certainly for a july rate cut said jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset capital management in chicago to me it all depends on where you look in the economy but over the last decade the federal reserve has been banging the inflation beehive with a baseball bat and the bees haven t come out so they figure keep trying this until something happens us stocks were trading higher with the benchmark s p 500 index briefly crossing the 3 000 point mark for the first time the us dollar fell against a basket of other currencies after the testimony government bond yields dipped with two year treasuries falling below 1 87 from around 1 93 earlier on wednesday meanwhile us interest rate futures appeared to price in greater odds of a 50 basis point rate cut this month the fed which hiked rates four times last year has kept its current benchmark overnight interest rate in a range of between 2 25 and 2 50 since december since a series of trump trade related tweets in late may both investors and the fed have begun shifting their stance with markets now expecting a cut of at least a quarter of a percentage point when the fed s rate setting committee releases its next policy statement on july 31 the us economy did not change much in the days that followed trump s may 30 comments on twitter threatening to impose tariffs on mexico unless the country met his demands for tougher controls on immigrants crossing its northern border but trump s statements spooked financial markets so decisively and the threats to the global economy became so palpable that a rate cut of at least 25 basis points now appears a near certainty with a 50 basis point cut also considered possible as extra protection
song chen china daily president xi jinping and his us counterpart donald trump may have agreed at the g20 summit in osaka to resume trade negotiations but the path to ending the trade war remains far from clear after all the two leaders had reached a similar agreement at the g20 summit in buenos aires in december 2018 and that agreement ultimately failed not least because the united states administration mistook china s conciliatory attitude for weakness whether the us administration makes the same mistake this time remains to be seen in any case it is worth considering how the trade war might unfold over the coming months and years and what china can do to protect itself us has not withdrawn tariffs it imposed earlier import tariffs may for the foreseeable future remain steady neither escalating nor being rolled back the agreement in osaka kept the us administration from following through on its threat to impose additional tariffs on 300 billion worth of chinese goods but it did nothing to reverse past measures such as the 15 percentage point tariff hike to 25 percent on 200 billion worth of chinese products that the us implemented after the 11th round of talks broke down in may while these tariffs have not yet had serious consequences for china s economy their effects are likely to deepen over time but china may succeed in persuading the us to remove them or at least not raise them further if it refrains from retaliating with tariffs of its own on us goods instead china should focus on reducing its bilateral trade surplus with the us on its own terms it is increasingly clear that the us tariffs have done more damage to american businesses and consumers than to china s already opposition to the washington triggered trade war is intensifying within the us for example the us chamber of commerce one of the country s most powerful business lobbies has called for the reversal of all tariffs imposed over the past two years the effects of the trade war have already spread to cross border investment in recent years rising chinese production costs have driven many foreign enterprises and increasingly even chinese enterprises to relocate their operations to lower cost countries such as vietnam and thailand the trade war is accelerating this process according to the vietnamese government inward foreign direct investment increased by nearly 70 percent year on year in the first five months of 2019 the highest such increase since 2015 meanwhile the growth of us investment in china is slowing essential to improve investment environment the us administration wants american companies to leave china it is up to china to persuade them to stay that means improving the local investment environment including responding to foreign companies justifiable complaints say by strengthening intellectual property rights protection and more broadly better adhering to world trade organization rules but the pressure on china does not end there the us is also eager to exclude the country s high tech companies from global value chains trump recently announced that he would allow us companies to continue to sell to chinese high tech giant huawei after a months long campaign against the company but it remains highly unlikely that the us administration which reversed a similarly aggressive policy toward smartphone company zte last year will abandon its efforts to strangle china s high tech industries china has three options first it could accede to us pressure to disengage from global value chains second it could remain committed to integration hoping that thanks to existing interconnections sanctions on chinese high tech companies will also hurt their us counterparts such as qualcomm enough for the us administration to back down the third option is to focus on supporting domestic high tech companies efforts to strengthen their own positions within global value chains and develop contingency plans us will try to subdue china by all means china s prospects for coping with financial sanctions which the us administration is likely to use more often are not so bright last month a us judge found three large chinese banks in contempt of court for refusing to produce evidence for an investigation into violations of sanctions against the democratic people s republic of korea the ruling ignores the fact that according to chinese law any request for banking records should be handled in accordance with the us china mutual legal assistance agreement chinese financial institutions thus need to prepare for more troubles

but it can step up legislative efforts to protect chinese banks interests while encouraging chinese financial institutions to treat compliance with us financial regulations with the utmost care it should also continue working to internationalize the yuan as there is still a long way to go on this front china remains committed to its 40 year old process of reform and opening up today that process must focus on redoubling efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights protection adhering to competitive neutrality and defending multilateralism but following through on this commitment

central bank will cut interest rates later this month as it confronts economic red flags and mounting political pressure in testimony before the house financial services committee powell suggested that the fed may slash borrowing costs in july to protect the u s from the continued economic strain of trade battles and a souring global economy economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies and that weakness could affect the u s economy powell said also noting concern with persistently low inflation powell added that u s business investment has slowed notably possibly due to concerns about trade tensions and slower growth in the global economy housing investment and manufacturing output have also declined this year reflecting broader domestic issues for the u s powell s remarks are the clearest signal yet that the fed plans to cut interest rates as insurance against a darkening economic outlook even as the central bank has little room to respond to a major crisis i ll bring you up to speed here political pressure the potential rate cut would be welcome news to president trump who has pushed the fed to slash borrowing costs since january but trump s pressure also poses political challenges for powell who will have to justify a potential cut while convincing the fed s critics that it did not cave to the president trump has bashed his hand picked fed chairman for more than a year ripping the central bank and its leader for raising interest rates four times since powell was confirmed in 2018 the president has also repeatedly raised questions about powell s job security insisting in several interviews including with the hill that he has the legal power to fire or demote the fed chief bipartisan praise lawmakers in both parties were eager to defend powell from trump s attacks praising his capability and transparency i believe you know what you re doing sir and i thank you for it said rep denny heck d wash even some of trump s most loyal allies lauded powell while defending the president s right to condemn the independent central bank mosads without quibbling about the details i think that you re doing an outstanding job said rep andy barr r ky to powell saying he s been easily accessible to lawmakers powell brushed off concerns about trump s influence with his usual refrain the fed only considers economic currents not political factors when shaping monetary policy to foster stable prices and maximum employment complicated outlook a volatile and complicated six months for the global economy gives the fed plenty to consider the u s economy has remained solid after a sluggish start to 2019 adding an average of 164 000 jobs each month and maintaining relatively steady growth consumer spending has rebounded after a brief dip but drops in business spending and other productivity boosting areas have raised concerns among economists powell attributed sinking business spending to growing concerns about global trade battles and rising odds of recessions in europe and china where industrial output is sinking what comes next powell will testify before the senate banking committee on thursday where he ll likely face many of the same questions there might be a heavier emphasis on the fed s deregulatory efforts from the gop controlled panel more from powell s testimony today powell on wednesday said that facebook s proposed cryptocurrency project poses serious concerns and warned the company against a sprint toward implementation leading the day white house congressional leaders revive budget talks administration officials and congressional leaders are trying to revive long stalled talks aimed at striking a budget deal and avoiding a government shutdown in the fall speaker nancy pelosi d calif is expected to hold discussions with treasury secretary steven mnuchin on wednesday marking the second day of talks after the two first spoke on the phone tuesday about raising statutory spending caps and the debt ceiling pelosi has been guarded about saying whether the renewed talks will lead to a breakthrough after negotiations between democrats gop leadership and the white house stalled last month asked if progress was made during tuesday s phone call with mnuchin pelosi told the associated press we ll see it s possible i don t know we ll see what they come back with she said when asked about the prospects of a deal coming together this month the hill s jordain carney explains here what s at stake the meeting comes as lawmakers attempt to kick start negotiations and move a package that would increase the spending caps and raise the debt ceiling before august that timeline leaves little room for negotiations with house lawmakers scheduled to leave town in late july and the senate slated to adjourn by aug 2 congress is juggling multiple funding deadlines lawmakers have until the end of september to pass a bill that would fund the government and prevent another shutdown they also might need to raise the debt ceiling as soon as early september an anxiety raising schedule because lawmakers won t return from the august recess until sept 9 trump officials launch investigation into french plan for tax on tech giants the trump administration on wednesday announced an investigation into the french government over its plans to implement a tax on technology companies united states trade representative ustr robert lighthizer expressed concerns that the french digital tax could disproportionately affect american companies the president has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts united states commerce lighthizer said in a statement the ustr investigation is the first step toward the potential implementation of tariffs or other trade measures against france at a time when president trump has ignited trade disputes with other allies ustr will conduct the assessment under the authority of section 301 the same provision that trump has used to cite national security concerns in imposing steep tariffs on chinese imports acosta defends epstein deal amid calls for resignation embattled labor secretary alex acosta on wednesday defended at length his handling of a 2008 plea deal with wealthy financier jeffrey epstein and insisted his relationship with president trump is outstanding despite swirling questions about his job security during a nearly hourlong news conference acosta said he is pleased that federal prosecutors in new york city are bringing sex trafficking charges against epstein but argued that facts are being overlooked in criticism of the deal he previously struck which some have called too lenient under that deal epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution under florida law registered as a sex offender and spent just over a year in jail while having work release privileges we believe that we proceeded appropriately acosta told reporters at the labor department where he spoke in detail about how his office ultimately decided to offer a plea deal to epstein while acosta served as u s attorney in miami we did what we did because we wanted to see epstein go to jail he needed to go to jail acosta said addressing critics of the deal acosta said times have changed and coverage of this case has certainly changed takeaway acosta was unemotional and unapologetic in defending the deal saying it was the best outcome he could get at the time will it be enough trump personally urged acosta to appear before the press to push back against his critics according to a person familiar with the conversation acosta insisted his relationship with trump remains strong and pointed to the president s tuesday comments in which he said the labor secretary has done a very good job and that he feels very badly for acosta trump has said he would be looking at the epstein case very closely he has very publicly made clear i ve got his support acosta said of trump still acosta acknowledged the possibility that trump who is monitoring news coverage of the epstein matter closely could change his mind the hill s jordan fabian and brett samuels have more on acosta s press conference here good to know president trump on wednesday warned that his administration would soon substantially increase sanctions on iran after the country exceeded the uranium enrichment level limits laid out in the obama era nuclear deal the 4th u s circuit court of appeals on wednesday dismissed a lawsuit

song chen china daily president xi jinping and his us counterpart donald trump may have agreed at the g20 summit in osaka to resume trade negotiations but the path to ending the trade war remains far from clear after all the two leaders had reached a similar agreement at the g20 summit in buenos aires in december 2018 and that agreement ultimately failed not least because the united states administration mistook china s conciliatory attitude for weakness whether the us administration makes the same mistake this time remains to be seen in any case it is worth considering how the trade war might unfold over the coming months and years and what china can do to protect itself us has not withdrawn tariffs it imposed earlier import tariffs may for the foreseeable future remain steady neither escalating nor being rolled back the agreement in osaka kept the us administration from following through on its threat to impose additional tariffs on 300 billion worth of chinese goods but it did nothing to reverse past measures such as the 15 percentage point tariff hike to 25 percent on 200 billion worth of chinese products that the us implemented after the 11th round of talks broke down in may while these tariffs have not yet had serious consequences for china s economy their effects are likely to deepen over time but china may succeed in persuading the us to remove them or at least not raise them further if it refrains from retaliating with tariffs of its own on us goods instead china should focus on reducing its bilateral trade surplus with the us on its own terms it is increasingly clear that the us tariffs have done more damage to american businesses and consumers than to china s already opposition to the washington triggered trade war is intensifying within the us for example the us chamber of commerce one of the country s most powerful business lobbies has called for the reversal of all tariffs imposed over the past two years the effects of the trade war have already spread to cross border investment in recent years rising chinese production costs have driven many foreign enterprises and increasingly even chinese enterprises to relocate their operations to lower cost countries such as vietnam and thailand the trade war is accelerating this process according to the vietnamese government inward foreign direct investment increased by nearly 70 percent year on year in the first five months of 2019 the highest such increase since 2015 meanwhile the growth of us investment in china is slowing essential to improve investment environment the us administration wants american companies to leave china it is up to china to persuade them to stay that means improving the local investment environment including responding to foreign companies justifiable complaints say by strengthening intellectual property rights protection and more broadly better adhering to world trade organization rules but the pressure on china does not end there the us is also eager to exclude the country s high tech companies from global value chains trump recently announced that he would allow us companies to continue to sell to chinese high tech giant huawei after a months long campaign against the company but it remains highly unlikely that the us administration which reversed a similarly aggressive policy toward smartphone company zte last year will abandon its efforts to strangle china s high tech industries china has three options first it could accede to us pressure to disengage from global value chains second it could remain committed to integration hoping that thanks to existing interconnections sanctions on chinese high tech companies will also hurt their us counterparts such as qualcomm enough for the us administration to back down the third option is to focus on supporting domestic high tech companies efforts to strengthen their own positions within global value chains and develop contingency plans us will try to subdue china by all means china s prospects for coping with financial sanctions which the us administration is likely to use more often are not so bright last month a us judge found three large chinese banks in contempt of court for refusing to produce evidence for an investigation into violations of sanctions against the democratic people s republic of korea the ruling ignores the fact that according to chinese law any request for banking records should be handled in accordance with the us china mutual legal assistance agreement chinese financial institutions thus need to prepare for more troubles including the risk of being blacklisted that is deprived of the right to use the us dollar and important services such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication financial messaging service and the clearing house interbank payments system it is a punishment few companies can survive already one chinese bank has been included on the correspondent account or payable through account sanctions list meaning that it cannot open correspondent or payable through accounts in the us make more efforts to internationalize yuan the chinese government has few options here but it can step up legislative efforts to protect chinese banks interests while encouraging chinese financial institutions to treat compliance with us financial regulations with the utmost care it should also continue working to internationalize the yuan as there is still a long way to go on this front china remains committed to its 40 year old process of reform and opening up today that process must focus on redoubling efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights protection adhering to competitive neutrality and defending multilateralism but following through on this commitment will require china to find ways to manage escalating tensions with the us and avoid a costly and potentially devastating reconfiguration of the global economy the author a former president of the china society of world economics and director of the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of social sciences served on the monetary policy committee of the people s bank of

the bank of canada kept its key interest rate unchanged wednesday and avoided signalling its plans even as its u s counterpart set the stage for a rate cut as soon as this month carolyn wilkins the bank of canada s senior deputy governor said canada and the united states are taking different approaches because they are in different stages of the economic cycle the fact that canada is picking up while the u s economy is slowing sounds like a divergence in fact it s a process of convergence she told reporters after the central bank released its latest interest rate decision as well as a quarterly monetary policy report the united states is slowing to a more sustainable pace while canada is moving back up to its trend growth the overnight rate remains at 1 75 per cent where it has stayed since the bank announced an interest rate increase in october 2018 the decision was in line with economists expectations the bank s report included a slight increase in canada s economic growth forecast for 2019 1 3 per cent up from the 1 2 per cent it forecast in its april report while projecting somewhat slower growth next year the report listed several positive signs of broad based growth in the economy but cautioned that global trade tensions particularly between china and the united states are already a drag on growth and could worsen the bank lowered its forecast for 2019 global growth to 3 per cent down from its april forecast of 3 2 per cent while recent export data for canada have been encouraging the trade environment continues to be the biggest wild card in our outlook said ms wilkins who spoke with reporters alongside governor stephen poloz the report came on the same day that u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell told a congressional committee that he would act as appropriate to protect the u s economy from the disappointing performance of the global economy the comments raised expectations that the fed could cut rates this month mr poloz s main challenge according to economists is to acknowledge the recent strength in the canadian economy without fuelling a spike in the canadian dollar just as the global economy is showing signs of weakness rbc senior economist josh nye said wednesday s policy statement was more dovish than expected while the bank did not appear to be moving toward a clear bias in favour of easing interest rates he said in a note markets seem justified in thinking the bank s next move will more likely be down than up other economists said they are not expecting any near term rate cuts in canada based on wednesday s report despite the downgrade to the outlook it s going to take a deeper deterioration to spark conversations about easing even as the fed seems poised to lower rates at month s end said benjamin reitzes the director of canadian rates and the macro strategist for bmo economics wednesday s report said the canadian economy performed above expectations in the second quarter after a slowdown in late 2018 and early 2019 the improvement was attributed to temporary factors such as the reversal of weather related slowdowns earlier in the year and a surge in oil production the bank lowered its forecast for 2019 global growth wednesday to 3 per cent down from its april forecast of 3 2 per cent no clear direction was provided regarding the bank s future policy plans recent data show the canadian economy is returning to potential growth however the growth is clouded by persistent trade tensions the bank said taken together the degree of accommodation being provided by the current policy interest rate remains appropriate the bank projects growth will hit 1 9 per cent in 2020 down from its april forecast of 2 1 per cent and 2 per cent in 2021 which is unchanged from the april forecast inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent throughout the forecast period right in the middle of the bank s target range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent wednesday s report projects inflation of 1 8 per cent in 2019 down from the april forecast of 1 9 per cent and is expected to come in at 1 9 per cent next year and 2 per cent in 2021 your time is valuable have the top business headlines newsletter conveniently delivered to your inbox in the morning or evening sign up today
